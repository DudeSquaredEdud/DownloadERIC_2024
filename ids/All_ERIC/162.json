        "description":"The MITRE Corporation has been experimenting with a system called Time-Shared Interactive Computer-Controlled Information Television (TICCIT) to show that standard TV receivers, cable television (CATV), and computers can be used to provide low-cost in-the-home information services. In the experiments computer generated pictures were delivered to customers over CATV. The users communicated with the computer through 12-button push-button telephones, and received individualized messages on their TV screens by means of at-home videotape recorders (VTR). If a transmitted picture carried an address that matched the customer's address, the VTR recorded the message. Some of the services offered included a home calculator, tax filing assistance, library services, electronic mail,  personalized job-finding and investment advice. Experiments indicated that TICCIT services may enable communications to reduce need for transportation. Barriers to introduction of the system include problems of privacy, marketability, and costs of programs. (MG)",

        "description":"The revolution in two-way broadband communications envisioned for the future includes remote access to libraries, interactive educational programing, shopping at home, personal and property security, and many other services limited only by man's imagination and his ability to deliver the service at a price the consumer is willing and able to pay. The most significant attributes of cable television (CATV) program origination are its ability to appeal to selective viewer interests and its ability to offer participation by the community. The development of specialized magazines in the 1960's showed that even a relatively small readership could be profitable. Similarly, CATV programs on such specialized topics as knitting or wine-making should be able to turn a profit. By the early  1980's, with its ability to reach selective audiences, CATV should capture about 3 percent of the total advertising expenditure in the country. Channel leasing and pay TV will provide additional revenue. The growth of revenue in CATV in the coming years should approximate that experienced by television in the early 1950's. (JK)",

        "description":"Cable television (CATV) promises to have the characteristics of a significant technology that will influence all of us in our personal lives and business endeavors. It will provide program diversity and new (nonbroadcast) services to households throughout the country. It will enable the viewer to interact with the program source via telephone. CATV channels will be leased by such diverse groups as merchandisers, news agencies, investment houses, government organizations, and educational institutions. Another broad class of CATV services will be pay TV, used not only for sports events and first-run films but also for adult education, specialized programs, and cultural events. Pay TV will be an essential feature to create the consumer demand for CATV in major metropolitan areas,  and it will provide the economic base to develop the market for other types of interrogation and response services such as remote merchandising, information retrieval, interactive education, and home security. A number of home communications experiments are planned for several communities. The two most pervasive impacts will be the substitution of communications for transportation and the increased use of the video medium for print. (JK)",

        "description":"Local program origination by cable television stations must be considered as the next step in the development of the medium. Although the growth of local origination as a significant means of informing and entertaining people can be accelerated through creative, relevant, and participative programming, the spiral of increased revenues, broader programming, and more subscribers and viewers will still take time to reach substantial proportions--especially in the light of continued government restrictions. As proprietary CATV channel programming, leased channels, premium entertainment, and instructional programming increase, the variety of revenue sources to support such programming will also increase. Although these forms of revenue will surely increase over the next five to ten  years, initially the local origination activity in any system should be geared to the expected near-term income and then expanded as additional revenues develop.

Two experimental groups viewed the series--one of these groups watched the thirty programs only and the other watched the programs and engaged in activities in both Spanish and English which related to the content of the day's program. A third group served as a control. Pre-and posttests with separate Spanish and English instruments yielded statistically significant gains for the viewers with greater gains for those who had supplementary activities, in a variety of areas. Surveys of  principals teachers, parents, and pupils on their attitudes toward &quot;Carrascolendas&quot; and its effects in the classroom indicated a positive response to the series. A process evaluation examined the interaction of various project components and provided suggestions for further improvements, including greater consultation in all areas and improved delineation of the role of advisory committee members.

Three short listening selections relating to military activities were subjected to compression and compression-expansion to produce seven versions. Data indicate that expanding previously compressed materials to restore the word rate to normal may restore the comprehension of the material to very near normal when the compression/expansion is limited to 40%. Present results substantiate findings that factors limiting the comprehensibility of rapid speech reside more with the inability of the listener to process rapid rates of speech than with the signal distortion produced by the equipment  or compression process.

The document first provides a review of relevant literature defining bilingualism, inherent characteristics of bilingualism, academic and psychological problems created by bilingualism, and essentials of language proficiency, and discusses specific patterns of difficulty to be expected in English-language performance. The author then describes an experiment conducted among 15 bilingual and 15 monolingual children to determine patterns of difficulty. The details and results are reported along with a discussion of implications. Findings confirm the  investigations and statements of linguists as to areas of difficulty for bilingual speakers; however, the similarity of performance by their monolingual English-speaking peers indicates that other dynamics influence the language development of children in both groups. These factors must also be investigated. (Author/VM)",

The general frame of reference for this study rests on the authors' belief that \"the ultimate (instructional) objective must be the language as the native speaker uses it, both publicly and privately, and all that this use involves concerning sounds, graphic symbols, meaning, and cultural values.

One of the major problems involved in this lack of physician manpower is that of a shortage of medical teachers. This problem is evident in developed nations, but is even more pronounced in underdeveloped or developing nations. Fortunately, international exchange of medical teachers and cooperation in teacher training has permitted progress that few nations could have achieved by themselves. This document addresses the question of the training of medical teachers with special regard to the needs of developing countries.

The original model legislation was related to the qualifications of legal age and length of domicile for voting in the state. Since that time, a constitutional amendment has been ratified by the states lowering the national voting age to 18. In addition, many states have correspondingly changed state voting requirements and a few states have changed the age of majority to 18. Due to these changes a revised version of the model legislation was developed based on the concept of domicile of the  student or his parents or guardians. Such model legislation can serve only as a guide and will need to be modified to meet the unique situation in the individual states. (HS)",

The study appears to support the following conclusions. Apartment dwellers see independence as a major factor in their choice of residence. They also believe that apartments are more convenient than dormitories and less expensive. Further, apartment occupants appeared not to have adapted to dormitory residence as a \"home.\" On the other hand, dormitory dwellers are less concerned about independence, are less pressed by the restrictions imposed by dormitory regulations, do not see apartments as convenient, and have adapted to dormitories on a \"home\" basis. While the press for independence appeared more conspicuously in apartment occupants,  detachment more often characterized dormitory residents. It therefore may be useful for the University (a) to consider on-campus housing arrangements that could accommodate students' emerging independence, and (b) to ferret out the detached student and enlist his greater involvement in the University scene.

The data were collected as part of a program designed to provide counseling and guidance services to black youth, and to establish a national longitudinal data resource for research analysis. Some of the major findings of the study include: (1) of the more than 54,000 student respondents, 60% were females; (2) almost two-thirds of the students aspire to attain a bachelor's or master's level degree; (3) almost 90% would be willing to work full-time if this were necessary to stay in college; (4) the most popular career choices selected by these students are in the education and business fields; (5) over 80%  feel that important reasons for going to college are to learn more, get a better job, and fulfill a need for college trained black people; (6) 13% report that there are 8 or more dependents in their families; (7) slightly more than 14% come from homes where the annual gross income is $12,000 or more; and (8) a majority of the respondents indicated that they think students learn most from books and teachers, and least from people in the community and other students.

Originally authorized by the Health Professions Education Assistance Act of 1963, the programs provide Federal financial assistance to schools of medicine, osteopathy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry, podiatry, pharmacy, and public health. The purpose of this report is to describe the legislative history of the Comprehensive Health Manpower Training Act of 1971 and to analyze its major provisions. Part 1 summarizes the major legislative programs enacted since 1963 that authorized Federal assistance for health professions education. Part 2 outlines the major health manpower bills introduced in the  92nd Congress to extend the HPEA programs in existing law. Parts 3 and 4 describe House and Senate Action on these bills, and Part 5 discusses in detail the major provisions and substantive changes in the particular programs authorized by the enactment of the Comprehensive Health Manpower Training Act of 1971.

It is hoped that participating colleges will be willing to grant advanced placement or credit, or both, to candidates who receive qualifying grades.

Residency requirements that discriminate against a class of persons solely because that class constitutes the number whose rent is needed to fulfill financial obligations of the institution have been found constitutionally invalid. However, residency requirements based on students increasing their educational experiences as a result of living on campus have been ruled permissible. Housing regulations, like other college regulations, must be in accord with the  lawful purposes and missions of the institution.

Educational testing and educational research have provided the instruments and models for the evaluation of educational programs. More recently, however, there has been an increased concern about the effectiveness of large scale social action enterprises. A concept of evaluation appropriate for the study of large and complex institutions can be summarized briefly as follows: (1) it begins with the central question \"What are the consequences?\" rather than the limiting question \"What are the objectives?\" (2) its style of inquiry is more aptly characterized by the work exploration than by words such as \"control\" and \"focus\";  (3) it sees the role of the evaluator as that of social scientist rather than teacher, missionary, reformer, or staff officer to the practitioners; and (4) its purpose is to provide more complex bases for informed judgment.

Six major options are presently available to small colleges regarding the use of computerized management information systems: (1) off-campus computers with no local terminals; (2) terminals to off-campus computers; (3) cooperative use of a computer with no terminals; (4) mini to small computers on campus; (5) cooperative use of computers via terminals; and (6) on-campus computers with communication capabilities. Most small colleges cannot afford an adequate computer system, the necessary software, and  trained personnel. However, the National Laboratory for Higher Education has developed at least a partial solution to this problem. The NLHE Information System is an operational computer software package designed for a small computer that requires no additional programming to generate management information.

As defined in this paper, women's courses explore the nature of women through historical, literary, biological and psychological means. The cause of the emergence of women's courses is the dissatisfaction with the way in which the role of women is portrayed or largely ignored in traditional programs of study. Proponents of women's studies say that the current status of women in contemporary course offerings reflects a viewpoint that takes male supremacy for granted, devaluing women's contributions to society. In addition, they assert women have internalized these negative views to the point where they have poor self-images  that result in lower occupational and personal aspirations. Thus, the purpose of women's courses is to restore women's self-esteem and to instill a sense of motivation and personal identity. (Author/HS)",

A primary reason is its critical bearing on the organization and structure of higher education. Smooth student transfer from 2- to 4-year institutions is a basic requirement of the hierarchical model of higher education now being developed by many states. A second reason is the large increase in transfer students due to the continuing rise in community college enrollment. A final reason is that it involves problems qualitatively different from freshman admissions. Ten transfer problems are presented: adequate guidance at the community college level; adequate orientation at the senior college; diverse admission procedures; diverse academic standards; the persistent  question of credit; access and retention; the need for financial aid; the need for space; and articulation procedures.

The committee found in its study that sex discrimination does exist at Bowling Green in the areas of hiring, promotion, tenure, rank, numbers, and salary. Thus, recommendations are made by the committee concerning: (1) the implementation of an affirmative action program; (2) the appointment of an assistant provost for women; (3) the organization of a permanent Commission on the  Status of Women; (4) the equalization of status of men and women faculty; (5) the appointment of women to policymaking posts; (6) equality in hiring practices; and (7) the inclusion of child-care and maternity leave provisions in faculty contracts.

More emphasis was placed on situational, psychological or emotional problems such as lack of money, academic and career problems, and disruptive family situations; (2)  the presence or absence of an existing facility was not necessarily a discriminating variable in student inclination to use a college health service; (3) an efficient emergency service would be used and appreciated by students; (4) students seemed to have a good knowledge of community health resources and were able to use them; (5) college awareness of student anxieties and availability of resources to cope with them would be an important addition to educational facilities in the post-secondary field.

Here presumably the major proponents and opponents of a bill voice their opinions, recite facts and support their beliefs. The transcripts of proceedings of Congressional committee hearings are among the type of documents most often mentioned as presenting problems in the library because the form and arrangement in which they are printed makes them a troublesome type of publication. They are troublesome because there is no uniformity in the identity and numbering of these hearings. For this study, seventeen Senate and twenty House Committees were used. Hearings printed from 1944-1949 and 1956 to 1972 were examined regarding  their respective histories and their current numbering systems. It was found that the Committees of Congress are slowly moving toward one numbering system--the combination code. This system is clear and precise. It relates the Congress in which the hearing was held as well as the number of the hearing. This numbering system will enable committee members, scholars, and interested citizens to utilize the hearings more effectively. (Author/NH)",

        "description":"This report deals with discrimination against women employed as librarians and library assistants at the University of California, Berkeley Library. The report demonstrates that (1) library professional, technical and clerical personnel--both women and men--work in &quot;women's occupations,&quot; and, therefore, are underpaid when compared to those employed in &quot;men's occupations&quot; which require similar backgrounds of education and experience; (2) within their respective categories of Librarian and Library Assistant, women are concentrated at the lowest levels; and (3) the opportunities for women to advance in their library careers are apparently diminishing. Some of the broader factors which contribute to the inferior position of women in the labor force are analyzed, such as stereotyped  attitudes about the &quot;nature&quot; of women, discriminatory hiring practices, limited educational opportunities and lack of adequate child-care facilities. Recommendations to correct these inequities include: immediate increase in salary for all women and men employed in the Library to parity with salaries of comparable male-typed occupations; corrective reclassification of women whose advancement has been retarded because of their sex; proposals for changes in hiring and recruitment policies, improvement of in-service training and career development, expansion of educational opportunities, provision of child-care facilities, and implementation of an affirmative action program.

The paper aims at the establishment of a language with which complex demographic manipulations can be briefly expressed in a form intelligible both to demographic analysts and to computers. The Demographic Computer Library (DCL) has been structured around three interrelated operations: Life table construction, stable population generation, and population projection. Life table construction is fundamental to the other two operations. The subroutines of the DCL have been written as parts of a system. The output of one subroutine is available for immediate use by any of a number of other subroutines. Other examples of DCL flexibility are given in part IV. The  contribution of the DCL to demographic analysis consists of reducing the drudgery and delays required by the multitude of mathematical computations. The DCL, cannot, however, claim to endow the nondemographer with the ability to produce high quality demographic analysis. (Author/NH)",

Followup studies were conducted after the workshop to discover what, if any, effect the workshop had on the participants' attitudes. Generally, the workshop participants favored cooperative efforts between different types of libraries, although some problems concerning such efforts in this region were perceived. By the end of the workshop, a few conditions were identified as being significant obstacles to cooperation, and at the same time, actions were specified to overcome these barriers. At the end of the workshop, 70% of the respondents agreed that the  lack of creative administrative leadership was a significant barrier to interlibrary cooperation, while only 10% agreed six months later in the followup studies. The impact of the workshop itself has not been completely measured by this study, but increased efforts for cooperation are encouraging. (Author/NH)",

Poverty was selected as the topic around which to focus the study. To find out what information was available to the community, the mass media were monitored on a sample basis. In addition, representatives of a sample of organizations were interviewed about the information concerning poverty disseminated by their organizations. This sample, and a random sample of household representatives were interviewed as to their exposure to information about  poverty, their beliefs and attitudes, and their needs for information. An analysis was made of the nature of the fit between exposure on the one hand and attitudes and beliefs on the other. Of interest to libraries concerned with disseminating information is the finding that different segments of the community are attuned to different types of media, and within the types, to different media agents.

The seven surveys included: (1) users of libraries, (2) non-users of libraries, (3) top level administrators of public libraries, (4) working librarians of public libraries, (5) top level administrators of public and  parochial schools, (6) working librarians of public and parochial schools and (7) administrators of community/junior colleges. The second phase consisted of analyzing the data of the surveys to determine the city demographic differences or the personal Mexican American attributes that were causal effects in library usage and non-usage.

Evaluation first considers the library as a whole as only one part of a total system of information sources serving professionals. This is followed by an evaluation of the collection, facilities and tools, and services of the library based on responses of those who use the library more than six times a year. A major feature of the evaluation is the use of a critical incident technique in which respondents furnish details of a recent incident when they located information which proved useful in their work. The role of the library is then inferred from comparison of  information source utilization using a previous study as a standard. The analysis of the library collection, tools and facilities, and services provides the basis for more detailed evaluation and recommendations. (Author/SJ)",

While it is necessary to protect the legitimate rights of copyright holders, their control over the use of copyright works must not become an obstacle to the development and improvement of documentation systems. Account must be taken of the interests of authors and publishers, but also of the advantages that photographic reproduction processes offer to users,  libraries, documentation centres, educational establishments, research workers, etc. This report does not repeat the arguments set forth in the preliminary study regarding the desirability and timeliness of adopting an international regulation on this subject, but takes into account new factors that have become operative since that document was prepared.

The ultimate goal of job satisfaction research is two-fold: (1) to increase the understanding  of employees and their supervisors in regard to the reasons underlying current management policies and practices and (2) to increase long-term understanding of the meanings and implications for managerial policy and practice of basic research in the field of job satisfaction.

        "description":"Scientific investigation begins with the null hypothesis which states that there is no relationship between sets of phenomena or sets of variables. This hypothesis is based on the philosophical and physical principle that there is a tendency toward disorder in the universe. This is also commonly referred to as the law of entropy. In order to impose system and order upon the chaotic sequences of events in the managerial universe, methods of analysis must be discovered which accept the null hypothesis but also recognize the concomitant existence of the alternate hypothesis which states that there is a relationship between sets of phenomena. In the spring of 1972, job satisfaction in a large modern library was surveyed. The purpose of the study was to discover whether regular  patterns of dispersion did exist in the library. The validity of the null hypothesis was assumed but the alternate hypothesis was not excluded. It was found that certain relationships did exist and statistical implications of the data appeared to nullify the broad premises of the null hypothesis.

The answer to this query is significant for two reasons: (1) the existence of relationships raises fundamental issues for consideration and (2) if no relationships exist; it is futile to continue down this road of inquiry. The techniques used in the study to assess employee satisfactions in a large, modern university library consisted of a series of formal and informal presentations followed by a Job Descriptive Index (JDI) questionnaire. The employees were requested to answer the JDI on a confidential basis. The occupational categories (professional library assistant, professional, administrator, clerical)  constitute the stratification principle upon which the data were structured. It was found that, overall, the professional library assistant enjoys her work most. Next, in overall satisfaction, is the professional librarian. The clerical employee enjoys her work least. Possible reasons for these findings are discussed. (Related studies are: LI003816 through 003818 and LI003820 and 003821.) (Author/NH)",

In this paper the concept of job satisfactions is delimited to include five principal areas, viz., work, pay, promotion, people, and supervision. Employee performance is the reciprocal concept. This paper is directed toward the job satisfactions area. This paper explores one facet of the more comprehensive study of Interuniversity Council (IUC) libraries. Its purpose is to compare and contrast two major divisions of the largest of the IUC consortium libraries. The goal is to study the laws relating situations, personal characteristics, and policies to satisfactions and to behavior. The library studied is divided into its two functional halves: (1) Public Services Division  and (2) Technical Services Division. It was found that Public Services employees in this library are happier than their counterparts in Technical Services. Each of the five principal areas of job satisfactions are explored for each division of the library. (Related studies are: LI003816 through 003819 and LI003821.) (Author/NH)",

The sample selected for study consisted of 67 employees, 22 male and 45 female. The original study explored the relationships between six areas of job satisfaction and 55 individual and situational variables defining the work setting of the library. This article isolates the variable of Education in a special analysis which is intended to show whether any connection exists between the independent variable of educational level and the criterion variable of job satisfaction. The findings of this study are inconclusive with regard to the relationship (if any) subsisting between education and job satisfaction. More research is needed to determine whether  the equivocacy in the education/satisfaction relationship found in this study is an episodic finding solely or whether it is, in fact, a more universal phenomenon.

A questionnaire was formulated through an analysis of other surveys at the conclusion of an extensive literature search. The questionnaires were randomly distributed to 250 residents of Central City. Of the total questionnaires distributed, 243 were retrieved, giving a total response of 98 per cent. The data were analyzed in several ways--cumulative comparisons, internal comparisons and national and local comparisons of similar surveys. Conclusions were made concerning social factors, reading patterns, and library use. Constructive  suggestions were made which could be used as guidelines in future planning activities for the Central City area. Areas for further studies are suggested in order to give this survey more depth and meaning.

Unstructured, in-depth interviews were held with Regional Program Officers, Division of Library Programs staff, and with a sample of institute directors. During the two-year period 156 institutes were funded, which some 4668 participants attended. Most of the institutes were full-time residential programs with 67 percent held during the summer months. Roughly classified,  some 39 percent of them were school library-oriented; the next highest, 10 percent, were oriented to public libraries. The directors reported the greatest impact (32 percent) was &quot;stimulation and interaction between the regular staff and students and those of the institute.&quot; For the participants, attitude change, job satisfaction, job skills, and improved job performance were given the highest ratings. Directors derived greatest satisfaction from interaction with participants. The issues of greatest concern to directors were negotiations with the Division, participant selection, ad hoc decision-making, and timing. (Author)",

The sharing of competences and facilities will make it possible to establish a service to MERIT institutions collectively that cannot be established separately. This expansion of the MERIT network will make demands on resources and facilities of its members, but in the long run the institutional objectives  will be better served. This program will further develop expertise in the planning and development of network goals and not merely represent the interest of the separate member institutions. (Author/SJ)",

The following types of audiovisual aids are included: educational games, filmstrips, flat graphics, kits, models, motion pictures, realia, records, slides, sound filmstrips, tapes, transparencies, and videotapes. The definition, cataloging, processing, housing, circulation and care of each is discussed. The two basic principles which were applied to this manual are: (1) instructional materials should be centralized, organized and administered for the maximum accessibility and use by students and teachers, and (2) the most important consideration in organizing materials is the content not the form.

It covers the 1125 LI documents listed in &quot;Research in Education&quot; from March 1971-April 1972 and focuses attention on the 169 which are not available from the EDRS. It briefly discusses the relative difficulty of obtaining non EDRS LI documents and aims at reducing the difficulty and increasing the control over the non EDRS LI document. Four tables present information which can be used to better control these documents. Table 1 lists the documents by ED number and notes those that are available from the National Technical Information Service, those that are listed in &quot;Library Literature&quot; ERIC/CLIS Lists and those on hand and on order for Our Lady of the Lake College  Library. The other three tables use complete bibliographic citations to list the entire 169 non EDRS LI documents and the hardcopy holdings and on order lists of these 169 documents at Our Lady of the Lake College Library. This paper will be especially useful to scholarly libraries that require good control of ERIC/CLIS holdings. (Author)",

This study examines these aspects of CATV in order to accomplish the following: (1) assess current and future technology, (2) determine feasible directions of network growth, and (3) indicate the planning and regulation required to obtain maximum social benefit. CATV has the potential for providing (1) a vast number of television channels; (2) a signal quality for the most poorly located viewer far superior to that currently available to the most favored viewer of broadcast television; and (3) such new  services as truly local origination and viewer feedback, or interactive programming. These features offer the possibility for drastic changes in both commercial television and formal and informal instruction. Whether CATV is merely one more profitable business or whether it becomes a major tool for revolutionizing society's ability to cope with its problems depends on our willingness to support broad technology and policy studies, and to devise and evaluate meaningful experiments delineating the medium's problems and possibilities.

This tendency was assessed at six different levels of training, ranging from undertraining to overtraining, and was examined at each of three ages--4 (N=116), 8 (N=216), and 12 (N=104). In the learning phase, subjects learned the spatial position of each of several stimuli differing in shape and color; the posttest phase determined the degree of importance each subject gave to the two stimulus components during learning. The results indicated that as the subjects learned the task, they maintained a relatively wide focus of attention, acquiring information about both components. This finding is contrary to the James and Greeno (1967) model  which indicated that children's attention did not become more selective as learning proceeded to criterion, and, also contrary to the model, overtraining did not generally tend to \"broaden\" attention as the subjects acquired little stimulus information beyond the point at which criterion had been reached.

It is based on the results of a 1968-69 study to determine the effects of instruction over one school year on the language behavior of disadvantaged prekindergarten children in public schools and nondisadvantaged private nursery school children. The Day Language Screen was used to assess each child's pre- and postinstruction ability on receptive and expressive aspects of standard English grammar along with his ability to use attributes in describing selected objects. The implications for instruction relative to language differences are that language program development should emphasize helping children develop increasingly  complex ways of using language to express thoughts carefully, as an aid in problem solving, reasoning, and in grouping real and abstract phenomena rather than focusing on teaching the grammar of American English. Specific language skills need to be identified and taught, and children must be given an opportunity to use these skills so related to total development. (JS)",

Specifically, they felt that the children had increased their verbal skills, preparedness for junior kindergarten, and social maturity. However, not all mothers were pleased with the increased independence shown by some of the children. A study of the children's characteristics suggested that caution should be exerted in extrapolating the findings from other so-called disadvantaged children to inner-city children in one's own city. Other data are useful but the needs of a particular population must be carefully observed. When isolating  deficiencies or identity needs, wholesale generalizations from superficial measures should not be made.

Approximately two-thirds of the subject population were monolingual (spoke only English) and one-third spoke only another language and/or English and another language. The results showed that: (1) those pupils for whom English was a second language overcame their performance deficit (due to lack of English fluency) by Grade 3 when they were ahead of monolingual students; (2) they were more likely to leave the school  system and enter the separate school system than were monolinguals; (3) they were less likely to be referred to Child Adjustment Services; and (4) they were not a homogeneous group. Speculation regarding these findings center on whether (1) the bilingual advantage continues into the higher grades, (2) exposure to two languages raises school performance, and (3) selective immigration, &quot;national differences,&quot; differential performance of rural and urban dwellers, or some other factors are being reflected.

One of the more recently developed is the Enabler Model, which is intended to provide regular on-site support, guidance and assistance to a local community for the implementation of preschool, day care and/or other early childhood programs. The Enabler Model has two phases: (1) the period of initiation, and (2) the period involving on-going maintenance of the Head Start Program. During the first period, the Enabler meets with all community groups to be involved in the program. During the second period, the Enabler's role shifts toward helping the local groups realize their goals. In sum, the six basic functions of the enabler are: supplier of information, interpreter of the program, link  between all segments of the community, a source of support, a demonstration agent, and a neutralizer of conflict. It is probably easier to implement the Enabler Model when the Enabler does not live and work in the community to be served. (CK)",

This review is divided into the following sections: Converging Forces and Orthodoxies; Educational Programming; Review Criteria and Procedures; Program Review Structural Outline; Instructional Systems; Delivery Systems; Evaluation Systems; and Support Systems. The problems of educating the poor and minority groups was one factor influencing the start of early childhood programs. Two dominant influences on early childood educational programming through the sixties are the Emergence Tradition and the Behaviorist Tradition. The Emergence Tradition holds that the child unfolds according to a genetic blueprint, and the Behaviorist Position holds that what a child learns makes the man. The initial criteria for program  inclusion in the review included: (1) that the program was developed and implemented for pre-primary age children between the ages of three and five; and (2) that the program had an educational component. The tentative outline for program review consisted of six categories and 26 items covering program foundations, instructional systems, delivery systems, installation and maintenance systems, and support systems. Recommendations for the program include: (1) That there be a master teacher assigned to each school unit; (2) That all professional personnel involved in program participate in orientation and evaluation; and (3) That further study be made concerning the length of the preschool program.

The study population consisted of 53 subjects, 3-1/2-4-1/2 years old. Kindergarten Evaluation of Learning Potential (KELP) was used to obtain data. The learning theory on which KELP is based postulates associative, conceptual and creative self-direction levels of learning. The study ran for 12 weeks. Each subject interacted with KELP approximately 20 minutes daily. It was hypothesized there would be no significant difference in the three levels of learning between (1) boys and girls in the experimental groups; (2) younger and older children in the experimental groups; and (3) kindergarten and prekindergarten children. There was significance at the .01  level between: (1) boys and girls in associative learning; (2) younger (3-1/2 - 4 years) and older (4 - 4-1/2 years) children in associative and conceptual learning; and (3) kindergarten and prekindergarten children in all levels of learning. This study indicates the ability to conceptualize preacademic skills is significantly better established at 4-1/2 years than at 4 years. This conclusion supports Piaget's theory that children develop the ability to generalize at about age 4. (Author)",

Each School district appointed a coordinator to assume responsibility for operation of the IRCs. The Laboratory coordinated efforts of IRCs by providing liaison support through dissemination of information to the Centers, visiting the sites, analyzing monthly reports, issuing public information regarding the KP and IRCs and providing training for IRC  coordinators. The Centers provided visitors the opportunity to receive an orientation to the Program, to observe its use in a classroom and to confer with teachers and administrators of participating schools. Procedures and materials required to document activities of the IRCs and the outcomes resulting from their establishment were developed.

From the recognition data, it was inferred that (2) the child's ability to form dynamic images relating two objects undergoes its most rapid development between the ages of five and eight; and (b) the preimagery child can generate dynamic mental imagery in which two objects interact if he concurrently engages in overt manipulation of the objects. This is true even when the child has no visual access to his movements or to the objects being manipulated.

        "description":"The generation of dynamic mental imagery is known to facilitate paired associate (PA) learning in older subjects. Wolff and Levin (in press) have reported that children who were apparently too young to generate mental imagery of this kind did benefit from self-generated motoric interactions involving pairs of toys. Since the result was obtained whether or not the child could see the objects he was manipulating, it was interpreted as supporting Piaget's contention that imagery production in the pre-imagery child requires the internalization of motor actions. In the present study, we examined the child's ability to generate memory-enhancing interactions between object pairs when either visual contact with the objects, tactual contact, or both were absent. The PA performance of each  of these activity groups (Visual-tactual, Visual-No Tactual, No Visual-Tactual, and No Visual-No Tactual) was compared with corresponding control groups which received imagery instructions, but had no opportunity to manipulate the object pairs. Rated quality of overt manipulation was lowered by the absence of tactual contact with the objects, but not by the absence of visual contact. Quality of manipulation was positively related to amount of facilitation of PA performance. These results support the involvement of overt activity in the young child's imagery production and learning, and also demonstrate the kindergarten child's inability to produce ongoing thematic activity when this activity is physically separated from the objects involved.

Most procedures which have been tried have not been successful with children younger than 6 or 7 years; however, Zhurova reports success teaching even 3-year-olds to isolate initial sounds of words with the method she describes. The current experiment evaluated Zhurova's iteration method of instruction by comparing it with a segmentation method. Ss were 32 kindergarteners. The two methods of instruction were fully crossed with four sequences of real word and nonsense  stimulus items, given in two training sessions. None of the six variables was significant; however, training time had a significant effect. (Author)",

The aim of this research report is to investigate patterns of adaptation and reaction to the industrial work situation. Interviewed in 1962 were 20 male migrants from rural Appalachia. Additional information concerning the characteristic and stereotyped traits of Appalachian migrants was obtained in 1963 from industrial relations personnel, foremen, and union representatives in the various factories where many of the Beech Creekers worked. It was determined that close family relationships facilitated a smooth transition from  farming to factory employment. Migrants' initial entry into the industrial labor market, their advancement in occupational status and their changes in place of work, their reaction to lay-offs and unions, and their job satisfactions are discussed. It was concluded that the Beech Creek stem-family served to stabilize the migrant's social world external to the factory by keeping off-the-job problems distinct from on-the-job performance. For these migrants, adaptation to an industrial occupation role merely required the acceptance of new work behavior standards and had little effect upon the more important aspects of their life situation.

Specifically, this essay discusses how education, the mass media, religious institutions, the local governmental structure, the economic contact between urban America and rural agricultural communities, and the contact structure between outer and inner educational systems in Appalachia attempt to integrate rural and urban subcultures. Emphasis is placed on the communication and linkage between these analytically distinct systems and how the nature of that contact situation affects an articulation of the  regional community and national sociocultural systems so that they function as a single system. Two main inferences emerge in the conclusion: (1) that a heavy investment of societal resources in the educational institutions at the elementary and secondary level would be a most effective strategy for securing the well-being of the Appalachian people, and (2) that agencies, such as the Extension Service or Programs of Adult Education, and organizations, such as the Community College System and Teacher Training Schools, should become more cognizant of the supportive role they play in strengthening the linkages between rural Appalachian communities and modern, rural America.

In the analysis of the data, authoritarianism and religious orthodoxy were found to be significant predictors of attitudes toward education, but these factors were found to have a negative relationship to education. Conclusions drawn from the analysis indicate (1) that either the area being studied is in a change cycle or that the area does not fit the regional patterns of education being  of high status among the religious biased people, and (2) that the high negative relationship between religion-authoritarian factors and education was possibly owing to the current, at least felt, radicalization of the university campuses.

The main emphasis in this essay revolves around the hypothesis that no effective national development is possible where the rural sector of the economy is deficient. The issues discussed pertaining to the rural population in developing nations are the numerical problem; the school's burden; the community's need; rural and urban coordination; lifelong education; primary and secondary education; continuity and cost; the content of agricultural courses; and the planning and implementation of programs which unite  educational, agricultural, and health officers along with other community workers in the development of a common sense of purpose. It is inferred that a pressing need exists (1) to orient education to economic and social development in the rural areas of young nations; (2) to effect a continuous educational process for the purpose of creating a lifelong learning process; (3) to harmonize urban and rural societies among all levels of the school system and among responsible agencies and parties; and (4) to plan carefully all conceptual, technical, economic, and administrative elements.

Educational policy changes needed for rural redevelopment are described in terms of the economic base, institution building in rural communities, adult education programs, structural changes in developing human resources needed  in the public schools, changes in tax policies, changes in personnel policies, organizational changes, curriculum changes, and educational policies affecting personal development.

The data was obtained via a questionnaire survey from 2,313 graduating seniors in the high schools serving 4 selected rural areas of Kentucky and West Virginia and from 1,396 students in the terminal classes of the comprehensive schools serving 3 selected rural areas of Norway. Parental interest, social class origin, and academic performance, it was concluded, have important independent and interrelated effects on educational mobility in both Norway and the United States.  Cross-culturally, social class origin and academic performance are the more consistent determinants of educational mobility, and their effects tend to be more stable. The findings further demonstrated that among American high school boys and lower class boys in the Norwegian comprehensive schools, a superior performance record in high school functions as a family involvement catalyst among the lower classes. Lower class girls, however, are at a continual disadvantage compared with upper class girls, regardless of past academic performance. The implication, viewed from a comparative perspective, is that the specific societal context may provide useful insights into the relative importance of the social-structural determinants of educational mobility.

The following questions suggest the research objectives: (1) Do NM Black families experience more frequent and higher degrees of disability than M Black families? (2) Does the M-NM differential increase as education of homemaker, level of income, and occupational status of the main breadwinner increase? and (3) Does family disability decrease under the above conditions? Selected from a large M center, a small town, and 2 small open-country villages, the respondents were Negro female homemakers between the ages of 18 and 65 having  children in the household. It was concluded that M and NM Black families were similar in exhibiting a low degree of family disability, and the NM-M differences observed in degree of family disability were not patterned consistently as expected through levels of education, income, or occupation. While not patterned consistently, the impact of these social attributes on disability did appear to vary often by NM-M residence. Recommendations for further research include finding more accurate instruments to record individual disability and alternative methods of securing responses and calculating the family disability index.

Grades of graduates were examined by analysis of variance and Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-ranks tests. I. Q. distributions at exit were fitted to the test norms. Tentative measures of hypothesized &quot;ideal&quot; classroom behavior were developed using the &quot;Coping Analysis Schedule for Educational Settings&quot; (CASES) and tested for construct validity. EIP school and length of treatment effects on the 2 measures were examined by analysis of variance. Sociocultural correlates of achievement differences between schools were isolated by step-wise regression analysis. Significant findings supported the effectiveness of the experimental treatments. EIP  graduates earned higher grades in 4 subject areas. The construct validity of the CASES instrument was thoroughly upheld. One of the measures of hypothesized &quot;ideal&quot; classroom behavior, an Overall CASES Coefficient, was found a significant predictor of academic achievement. Family size, occupational status, and family income were found to be predictors of reading and language achievement. The CASES instrument and the Overall CASES Coefficient were found useful in predicting school achievement. Classroom social behavior, produced experimentally, was found to account, significantly, for gains in reading and language skills. Implications of the findings were discussed. (Author)",

        "description":"The extent to which regional variations in socioeconomic circumstances influence the educational mobility patterns of rural youth and the nature of those influences is explored in this cross-national comparative study. The study drew upon data from 3 modern, industrialized societies: Germany, Norway, and the United States. The study population is described as (1) elementary or secondary school students at a stage in the educational career track immediately prior to a major decision-making point; (2) essentially rural; and (3) more or less &quot;total populations&quot; of students at the specified &quot;terminal grade&quot; level in the schools serving the selected regional areas. The areas were chosen to represent a fairly wide range of rural socioeconomic circumstances within each of the 3  societies. Data, from questionnaires administered in classrooms by research staff or regular school personnel, were collected in Germany during the spring of 1965; in Kentucky, spring, 1968; and simultaneously, in West Virginia and Norway, spring, 1970. It was determined that the major theme that emerged concerned social differences in the structuring, by regions, of educational opportunities. The findings indicate that in the United States rural industrialization enhances the quest for higher education while the educational opportunities and upward educational mobility ambitions of lower class youth are depressed in areas of limited economic opportunity, such as Appalachia. In Europe, where educational systems are managed by the state, upward educational mobility exists as a meaningful  option for youth in all areas. Six tables and a figure comparing the 3 countries' educational systems are included. (FF)",

A random sample of 500 urban school teachers employed in the public school system of East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, constituted a portion of the respondents in this study. The pre-test survey study data were derived from 60 rural school teachers who returned both VIDI and census-profile data. Two basic propositions delineating individuals who interact in social roles and who face varying degrees of stimuli to change guided the development of VIDI. The first proposition was that choice-making is structured through a value-type orientation or an  interest-type orientation. The second proposition concerned the role actor's tendency to resist or to be receptive to pressures of change when making choices in terms of value primacy or interest primacy. The summary indicated distinct modal patterns of census-profile characteristics as measured by the 28 survey census variables tested. The role adjustment mode of 3 out of 5 respondents was that of an interest-nonchange Ritualist. It was concluded that the relatively homogeneous social history background of respondents facilitated the development of this particular mode of role adjustment. The VIDI and tabulations of survey-census-profile data are included in the appendices. (HBC)",

Begun by the University of the Philippines, College of Agriculture, and the Board of National Education, it is a secondary school program for barrio youths who have decided to stay, live, and work in the barrio as farm operators. It is aimed towards (1) determining whether a non-college preparatory secondary school program is possible in a village setting, (2) determining the extent of the school's contribution to the socioeconomic development of the people and the village, and (3) studying the sociological processes involved in the introduction and operation of such a school project. The Barrio Development School trains  prospective (12-18 year olds) farm operators on their own farm, where day-to-day problems have to be studied and solved. In addition to learning about farm production, the future farmer learns about supply, labor, credit, marketing, and other management requirements of modern farming. The student operates the farm by himself, with the guidance of the agriculture teacher and his parents. This paper discusses the resistance encountered from the barrio leaders and parents, the program-supervised farming projects (i.e., raising rabbits for profit), and the school's impact on the barrio, parents, and educators in the country, as well as from other countries. This paper also compares the school project to the present secondary school programs. (NQ)",

The causes and consequences of rural depopulation were examined in 4 fairly typical rural communities; these 4 communities and their present populations are (1) the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, 283,000; (2) Mid-Wales, 174,000; (3) North Norfolk in Eastern England, 29,000; and (4) North Mayo in Western Ireland, 32,000. All of these communities have registered a decline in population during the last 20 years, with the Scottish area showing some recovery during the last 10 years. This paper also examines economic and social factors associated with migration in North Norfolk. Findings suggest that the considerable realignment of the structure and organization of agriculture is the  basis for migration from these areas. Other possible reasons for migration include entry into an occupation other than agriculture, individual levels of occupational aspiration, and degree of satisfaction with the local community. The consequences of depopulation include unbalanced age structures and sex ratios in the rural population and a decline in demand of such services as public transportation; considered a most serious consequence, the effects become causes in themselves. Data are presented in tabular form. (NQ)",

Possible criticisms (i.e., that the strategies are too general or are not sufficiently realistic) are examined. Other topics discussed in this report are rural development in the  context of national development, the role of public participation in such a strategy, and the immediate situation. Also discussed are factors which will likely affect the future of rural Canada, for example, technological advances will increase the potential productivity per unit of labor, accelerate the process of urbanization, and enable the movement of large volumes of information considerable distances almost instantaneously.

The need for this research arose because of employment problems in areas where the economy is based on agriculture. The 95 participants (aged 20-22) were selected from 14 villages, made up of 40 to 50 families, located close to industrial enterprises. Questionnaires with closed and semi-open questions were administered in personal interviews, and interviews were conducted with  plant managers, labor managers, and workers. The study determined that the measure of information which a person had on a chosen field influenced his attitude towards that occupation. A person with a limited knowledge about an occupation tended to display a negative approach towards the occupation. By contrast, the greater the knowledge about the occupation, the more positive the attitude. Persons receiving direct information from the plant or from a relative had a positive approach in contrast to an individual who received indirect information. Generally, the individuals interviewed displayed limited knowledge about the occupations, and this fact possibly explains why few people reach industrial work. (FF)",

The historical change the concept has undergone in the rural community is presented through reviews of other research on rural authority. The different types of rural authority discussed are (1) the authority of farmers, (2) authorities with individualistic attitudes and authorities with social attitudes, (3) the authority of the farmer &quot;patriarch&quot; (owner of a fairly large, family type farm who employs hired labor), and (4) the authority of civic leaders. These authorities tend to influence agriculture and agricultural production. Their influence also extends into the spheres of upbringing and educating children, public  institutions and organizations, and the rural inhabitants' social behavior. These influences are briefly discussed. (NQ)",

Quality of life has a number of aspects, but the economic is viewed as a particularly strategic one for promoting overall life quality. The economic is defined as providing jobs for rural residents. Two techniques for doing this, inducing firms to locate in rural areas and rural residents' commuting to jobs in urban centers, contain economic disadvantages. An alternative is to have rural residents work at home and send the effort of their work to firms in urban centers via electronic communications systems. This alternative depends on the distinction between jobs and firms. It also depends on being able to view many jobs as essentially consisting of information processing. The input to  the output from the rural worker flows over a national network termed the \"total electronic information system.\" (Author)",

The study examines the relationship patterns between such indepedent variables as age, sex, years of formal education, birthplace, birthplace of parents, and language spoken in the home with various forms of self-identity concepts. Three types of reference groups were used: (1) positive reference groups (the individual's cultural group guides his behavior), (2) negative reference group (the individual opposes or rejects his cultural group), and (3) aspirational reference group (the group into which the individual desires to be accepted). The sample consisted of 228 families from predesignated residential dwellings, blocks, and census  tracts having moderately large concentrations of families of Mexican or other Spanish extraction (only 150 interviews were completed). The sample consisted of 48% males and 52% females. The findings indicated that 54% preferred \"Mexican American\" for purposes of designation in official Census Bureau forms; 43% of females preferred Mexican American for self-designation purposes; Mexican/Mexicano was preferred by the less educated, while the more educated preferred Mexican American; and foreign born persons preferred Mexican/Mexicano or Mexican American while native Americans chose Mexican American or Chicano. The study concentrated on West Texas; it was decided that a major weakness of this study was the rather small sample size which did not consider the self-designation patterns of other  regions and localities.

Two methods, both utilizing the same interview schedule, were used to obtain the samples. In the first method, the Community Reconnaissance Method, positional and reputational leaders in each county were interviewed--117 in DeKalb, 74 in Laurens, and 83 in Lumpkin. The second survey was conducted in DeKalb and Laurens only, using 368 household heads and 322 registered voters. Selection of respondent leaders was made by (1) choosing top positional leaders from basic institutional areas, (2) getting nominations of general influentials, specialized leaders, sublocality leaders, and  underrepresented categories from a panel of positional leaders and members of sponsoring organizations, and (3) asking each respondent selected to name 6 or more of the most influential leaders from his community. Findings indicated that leaders were more likely than nonleaders to belong to coordinative community groups and to reflect a coordinative orientation by naming 1 or more coordinative community needs and that in the urban community, both leaders and nonleaders were more likely to reflect a coordinative orientation than were those in the rural community. This difference appeared to associate with high levels of education and occupational positions held by leaders and nonleaders in the urban community as compared to the rural community. (NQ)",

Data for 74 nations representing all geographic areas of the world are presented and analyzed. The 5 measures of societal systems chosen for comparison are the power-tool measure, energy consumption, human resource development index, index of societal differentiation, and gross national product per capita. The 5 societal sectors considered in constructing differentiation indices are political, economic, education, social welfare, and communication. The authors conclude that all the measures are not apparently measuring different aspects of society, but the measures appear to tap some  similar underlying dimension of society. They suggest the use of an energy consumption measure as the best measure of societal modernization and of the status of societies relative to other societies. (PS)",

The hypothesis underlying this study is that much of the variance in the dissensus between organizational leaders and rank and file members related to participant obligation can be explained by the measures of perceived benefits, value orientation, and perceived alternative organizations from which these benefits can be received. The sample consisted of 2 subsamples of 50 persons each which were randomly drawn from the organizational members classified by the organization's leaders as \"active\" and \"less active.\" The results of this study suggest that perceived benefits, both current and anticipated, and the value the respondent attached to the  particular type of benefit are related to adult socialization. It was further concluded that the noneconomic benefits were more highly associated with role performance than the economic benefits, and anticipated benefits were generally more highly associated with role learning than were benefits currently received. The study, in focussing on role learning, examined the successful transmission of what the role of member involves; it is recommended that the next step in understanding participation is that of examining the consistency between what the member thinks he should do as a member and his actual behavior.

It is stated cagegorically that a problem does exist. Indicators often used to deny this position are population density and pressure, undeveloped resources, the availability of empty lands, and alleged intrigue by external forces. In the first part of this paper, the author discusses pro-natalist arguments. They are as follows: (1) Africa is underpopulated and the population density is very low; (2) undeveloped resources and empty lands abound; and (3) the suggestions that family size should be limited are the products of imperialist intrigue. The second part of the paper discusses what African governments have done about the population problems  in their various countries. The author's summary of researches conducted in various countries of sub-Saharan Africa deals with the ideal family size, the knowledge of traditional and modern contraceptive methods, the interest in family planning, husband-wife communication, the actual usage of these methods, and the relationship between population problems and political violence. Statistical analysis revealed a significant correlation between percent literate and sabotages, assassinations and purges. Another correlation was found between the 1967 population and total killed in all internal violence, riots and rebellions, peaceful demonstrations and strikes. (HBC)",

The field procedures for identifying power actors in the communities involved interviews with (1) external community knowledgeables, (2) internal community knowledgeables, and (3) power actors. Information from interviews with 92 power actors was analyzed by reference to 8 general hypotheses. Implications for change agents include the following ideas: knowledge  of power actors and the power structure may be helpful, power structures are likely to be more polymorphic as the size of the community increases, power actors may not be holding positions of authority, and a knowledge of role is important.

Discussions cover the educational role of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the beginning of modern education with the opening of the first public school in 1906 by Emperor Menelik II, the effect on Ethiopian education of the power struggle which followed Menelik's death and World War I; and, in 1941, with independence, the challenge of starting the development and expansion of schools almost from scratch. Also, a historical comparison of the policies and attitudes of church education and modern  education is made. The remaining discussions cover the comprehensive high school, the teacher training institutes, the problem of dropouts, the change of attitudes and rural development, and the enrollment and dropout figures for Ethiopia. Two figures showing elementary and secondary school enrollment data and a 9-entry bibliography are also included. (FF)",

The policies followed to increase the level of literacy in Turkey have differed from one time to another, and some of the measures that were taken became subjects of political controversy. The literacy figures given are based on census data taken by primary teachers in rural villages and small settlements where illiteracy is a problem. The political background and early efforts on literacy training--nation schools, literacy classrooms, the outcomes of literacy courses, some conclusions about the literacy campaigns, the literacy classrooms at the present and their problems--are sketched. The approaches used in literacy  training are described in 3 sections (1) early literacy training efforts, including the adoption of the Latin Alphabet; (2) the institutions involved--people houses and people rooms (1932-51), people education centers and reading rooms, and other programs, for example, literacy training in the Army, 4-H clubs, agriculture extension courses, health education programs, home economics programs, and mobil courses for village boys and girls; and (3) the present plans for literacy training through primary education--the problems of expansion, the policies followed to solve the problems, and the planned targets for primary education. Overall results of the efforts on literacy training are discussed, and data showing differences in literacy rate by sex and age group are presented. (FF)",

The Subcommittee assembled 2 bibliographies: (1) dealing with discrimination in connection with USDA programs and (2) dealing with large-scale organizations of which USDA is an example. Members of the Subcommittee did individual exploration in their own states to discover examples of discrimination in connection with USDA programs. Also, multiple copies of a 1 page questionnaire were sent out to key individuals in each of the 50 states. Notices were placed in social science journals indicating that  the Subcommittee existed and requesting information. Evidence of discrimination by the USDA in its programs and policies in the past and of continued discrimination were found. Recommendations, placed at the beginning of this report for emphasis, include suggestions as to what individuals can do to help eliminate the problem of discrimination with respect to the disadvantaged. Furthermore, recommendations are made to members of the Rural Sociological Society describing the problem areas needing research, policy formulation, and action (areas which have some relation to equality of access to benefits of USDA programs).

The primary vehicle used for collecting information was the focus interview--a technique used to gather in-depth information on opinions and preferences. The interview sessions included 8-12 participants who were encouraged to comment on all aspects of Indian educational needs. Tape recordings of the interviews with parents, students, and teachers were made by 2 interviewers, both of whom later filled out an interviewer's report form. Findings indicated that there are cultural differences among Indians and non-Indians; that the students suffer from feelings of inferiority; that because  school personnel fail to recognize cultural differences and are unable to adapt to the teaching of Indian students, the students are not qualified to face the outside world and drop out; and that school changes tend to be superficial. Standardized scores showed Indian students to be below the standard norms. Based on what was learned from the focus interviews, 19 recommendations were listed for the administration of Title III at the state level and for the educational needs and commensurate project alternatives from the focus interviews. Six underlying needs discovered in the focus interviews were improvement of educator-learner relationships, student self-image, student involvement, educational administration, curriculum structure, and community involvement.

To achieve these objectives, the Arizona Department of Education and the Elementary and Secondary Act Title III, sponsors of the conference, brought together more than 60 educators from Arizona elementary and secondary schools where Indian students are enrolled. The conference held 8 informal discussion groups where participants expressed  their views regarding the study, their individual programs, and the needs of Indian education in the state. In the concluding remarks, it was observed that American Indian professional educators can contribute to the statewide educational system and that basic issues of contention between Indians and non-Indians remain unsolved. It was also suggested that a statewide Council on Minority Education be organized to assess needs and priorities, that this Council hold grass roots and regional meetings, and that it establish Minority Education Centers which would develop their own specialities emphasizing the needs of the people served. The Council's strength, would lie in its ability to recognize needs common to all minorities and needs unique to each minority.

        "description":"In 1967 the National Advisory Commission on Rural Poverty made a comprehensive study and appraisal of the economic situations and trends in American rural life; evaluated the means by which existing programs, policies, and activities relating to rural people might be coordinated or redirected; and developed recommendations for action by government at the local, state, or Federal level or by private enterprise as to the means of providing opportunities for the rural population. This report, 4 years later, describes the extent to which those recommendations have been implemented. The Economic Research Service of the U. S. Department of Agriculture conducted an investigation to determine what action, if any, had been taken to carry out the Commission's recommendations in the areas  of creating a favorable economic environment; establishing national manpower policies and programs; improving rural education, health and medical care, family planning programs, welfare services, and rural housing; establishing area and regional development districts; fostering community organization; conserving and developing natural resources; adjusting production in agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and mining; and assisting in developing more effective government for rural opportunity.

The objectives of the program were to enable the participants to (1) improve their ability to work effectively and constructively with Indian students and to find possible sources of financial aid in relationship to vocational-occupational aspiration, (2) develop strong organizations to service Indian students, (3) establish a common philosophy and standard practices with reservation and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) area offices, (4) coordinate financial resources in the institution and the community aimed at Indian  students with educational or socio-economic barriers to higher education. The problems Indian students encounter in obtaining financial aid were uncovered and used in planning the program. Approximately 300 persons who worked in the areas under discussion were invited; 44 accepted. The 44 participants were divided into 4 groups to discuss questions in 6 areas: Indian education coordinators, Indian education committees, college financial aids officers, college Indian advisors, BIA scholarship officers, and high school counselors. Discussions ranged into community involvement, problems of both students and financial aids officers, student needs, educational reforms, and the problems of communication and coordination. A field study follow-up and recommendations--that the criteria for  financial aids awards need to be revised, that counseling should be more effective, and that additional training should be provided--are included.

        "description":"The purposes of this dissertation were to determine (1) if self-concept is affected by the independent conditions of skin color and sex and (2) if self-concept is affected by the interactions resulting from the variables of skin color and sex. Two hypotheses were tested: (1) that there would be no significant main effects between the variables of sex and students' perceptions of skin color on the self-concept of Mexican Americans from a low socioeconomic level and (2) that there would be no significant interaction effects between sex and skin color on the self-concept. This study was conducted in 2 New Mexico public high schools during 1971-72 and consisted of 174 Mexican American 10th, 11th, and 12th grade students for whom 4 data indices were available (scores on the Tennessee  Self Concept Scale, scores on Hollingshead's Two-Factor Index of Social Position, classification as to skin color, and sex). Interviews with the subjects by the investigator provided information pertaining to self-perception of skin color in addition to the investigator's rating. Color transparencies were made of the hand and arm of each subject for evaluation by 1 Anglo and 2 Mexican American judges. Analysis of variance was done to determine any significant main effects and interactions followed by an After F Test. Where significant F ratios were obtained, the Neuman Keul's Multiple Comparison Test was applied to determine significant differences. Pearson's Coefficient of Concordance was used to determine significant correlations between the students', judges', and investigator's  ratings of skin color. Findings partially supported hypothesis 1 and found no significant interaction effects in support of hypothesis 2. (NQ)",

        "description":"The findings from a recent study of the occupational and educational status projections of Mexican American, Negro, and Anglo youth are reviewed. The findings were that (1) the status projections of these youth are significantly similar although certain slight differences are noted, and (2) goals established by these youth are predominantly high level goals. These findings serve as bases for investigation concerning the differentials in opportunities and in social support in facilitating these youth in achieving their goals, special emphasis being given the Mexican American relative to Negro and Anglo youth. Tentative conclusions at this point are that Mexican American youth relative to Negroes and Anglos are more severely handicapped in pursuing their goals due to such features  as a comparatively lower level of political activism, fewer supporting formal organizations, lack of knowledge and access to knowledge about educational systems and opportunities, language difficulties, and having certain subcultural values which can complicate achievement in the mainstream, Anglo-oriented United States society. Utilizing a theoretical scheme developed by Merton, a speculative inquiry is made into the probable consequences (e.g., heightened political and other social activism, possible \"rebellious\" activities, counter-cultural movements, and possible coalescence with other ethnic minority organizations) of Mexican American youth experiencing goal blockage. Speculative implications for the Mexican American individual and ethnic group and the larger society are drawn.  (Author/NQ)",

Three test communities without previous experience with Extension activities were selected. These test communities were surveyed to provide information about the communities and their residents that could be used for subsequent program planning. Information was collected in the following areas: locational characteristics of the communities, population structure by sex and age, educational attainment, employment, income, and existence of community in the 3 areas. Programs in early childhood education, health, recreation, and community development were introduced. The major conclusion of this evaluation study was that the project was  successful to the extent that it demonstrated that organizational structures can be created, new services delivered, and educational work can be carried on by Extension in low-income rural communities. Some guidelines for future programs were suggested. Examples of interview schedules and suggested activities were presented in the appendixes. (PS)",

Marland, Jr., U.S. Commissioner of Education, discusses both the shortcomings and accomplishments of the American education system when it comes to educating Mexican American students. It is noted that even though the Federal government has funded compensatory education programs and projects designed for Spanish-speaking children, the Mexican American students have a higher dropout rate than any other identifiable minority except American Indians. Also noted is the fact that some southwestern schools have begun bilingual programs where subjects are taught in both Spanish and English to all students. A major problem of the education system, which is discussed, is  the past failure to teach Mexican American and other minority students to take pride in their cultural background and their national history. Mr. Marland discussed the fact that in school Mexican American children learn \"virtually nothing\" of their ancestors and that what they do learn is uncomplimentary. It is also pointed out that very few school staff members in the 5 southwestern states are Mexican Americans and that Spanish is excluded from the classroom, playground, and in school communications to parents.

Having as its target population junior high school CVAE students, the project's field test involved more than 120 students and 6 academic teachers in the Austin Junior High School, Pharr-San Juan-Alamo Independent School District. Eighth grade students participated in the mathematics, social studies, and language arts curricula, and 9th grade students participated in the mathematics and science curricula. Developed around student performance objectives, the system provides for individual learning rates. Students receive instruction via  filmstrips, cassette tapes, and realia, as well as by paper-and-pencil activities. They proceed from simpler to more complex tasks as they move individually from one objective to the next. Field test students, typically disenchanted with formal schooling, were involved in the planned learning activities up to 71% of the time and in individual work up to 57% of the time. Absenteeism and disciplinary referrals dropped. Ninth grade students' more positive attitude toward science was documented. Mastery over specific performance objectives, from 88.7% to 99.8% in the different curriculum areas, was accomplished. It was concluded that the instructional system is viable, and it was recommended that the project be continued and expanded. (Author/NQ)",

Analysis of covariance indicated no advantage in using the same media in the learning and testings sessions.  The Verbal Reasoning Test scores of the Differential Aptitude Tests served as the covariate scores. These findings question the extent of the theory's applicability and usefulness to meaningful prose material in science, especially where the instruction more closely approximates school-relevant conditions at the secondary school level.

The reports summarize assessments of the state of knowledge on various air pollution problems, particularly in California, and make tentative recommendations as to what the University of California can do through Project Clean Air to alleviate those problems. In this report biomedical effects of air pollution are evaluated from epidemiological evidence and from experimental studies. Human hazards are emphasized to establish whether enough evidence exists to set air quality standards because of demonstrated human health effects. Section I provides a review of the findings and suggests basic and applied research that is  needed. Section II enumerates: (1) the biomedical effects of fossil fuel combustion, (2) effects of individual pollutants, (3) effects of inherited metabolic patterns on air pollutant susceptibility, and (4) environmental carcenogens, mutagens, and teratogens. The last section offers tasks recommended for the Project in the nature of mission-oriented programs. Literature cited is listed.

First, the roles of this site for environmental studies are explained as: (1) an ecology laboratory, (2) an environmental management laboratory, (3) a natural history interpretive area, and (4) a multiple-use school and community recreation area. Site planning is viewed as the key to effective school site design, development, and utilization. The three basic phases of planning are discussed in detail. Site Analysis gives an inventory of all factors which may influence the site; natural and man-made influences relating to ecological, economic, political, social, technological, and  aesthetic points of view. Program Development is concerned with analyzing the nature of the particular purpose or use for the site. Design Concept Development is the graphic interpretation of how the site and program should be blended into a compatible solution. Accompanying the narrative material are examples of site analysis diagrams; a model of steps in the program development process; and examples of the schematic solution to the design problem.

On the basis of ability, achievement in school, and results on the California Achievement Test, 75 fourth, fifth, and sixth grade students from each of two schools were selected as the research group, and 75 in one school and 40 in another were identified as the control group. Two mathematics laboratories in two elementary schools were put into operation and students attended 45-minute laboratory sessions twice weekly. Sessions were conducted on a diagnose-prescribe model, focusing on the areas where students needed additional work. Posttests for achievement and  attitude were administered when the laboratory sessions concluded. The study found that mathematics laboratories used with slow learners and with gifted learners facilitated a slightly increased academic achievement in both cases, with more of an increase occurring at the lower grade levels. The laboratories also facilitated an increased positive attitude toward mathematics, with a significant increase occurring in the school located in a deprived area. There was no significant difference in achievement scores between laboratory and control groups. (Author/DT)",

It is absurd for political systems to attempt to adapt ecological factors to fit the underlying political assumptions; political philosophy must become consistent with ecological truths. In the developing nations it is most important to rapidly introduce environmental education for higher education students, who will be most able to influence policy. This-higher education should enable students to see that economic development and ecological conservation practices are not incompatible. For example, marginal lands, which tend to be unsuccessfully converted to agricultural uses, can contribute to a nation's economic development more effectively when  alternative uses are planned for the land. National Parks and Game Reserves in some poor tropical nations have demonstrated that these areas, if conserved and managed in the light of ecological principles, can generate much more income than if they were convertd to food production and their long-term usefulness destroyed.

Spanning the range of problems associated with reducing emissions, they are divided into three main areas of research: (1) engineering projects that explore the interaction between the petroleum products and the automotive equipment in which they are used, (2) atmospheric projects that investigate pollutant behavior in the atmosphere, and (3) medical projects that study the effects of emissions on health. As a result of these projects, increased data are available which will be useful in the planning and development of effective emission control  technology and provide assistance to government agencies in the promulgation of realistic air quality criteria and emission control requirements. Presented in the review are both a resume and a detailed account of 41 projects currently underway, enumerating project name and number, objectives, and current status. In addition, the Coordinating Research Council and its air pollution research program are described, together with membership lists, a progress chart of projects for 1971, and an anticipated schedule of progress during 1972.

Emphasis is upon familiarizing students with the many ways they can actively participate in support of candidates before they reach the voting age. Six chapters are presented containing case studies and discussion questions. Political parties are examined, defined, and compared. Precinct organization and the role of the precinct leader are described. The purposes, organization, committee functions, and financing of  political activity during the campaign period are analyzed. Origins, functions, and types of political clubs are examined, noting that such participation is especially suitable for beginners. Problems that confront political leaders are identified. Types of political meetings and methods of planning and conducting them successfully are discussed. (SJM)",

A response to a renewal of interest in alternative forms of social action, the pamphlet results specifically from an international seminar of experienced organizers and trainers held at Preston Patrick, Westmorland, England, June 27 - July 2, 1970. Its purpose is to present practical guidance in training for nonviolent direct action. One of the first chapters discusses kinds of training--skills training, theoretical training, crisis training, and training in competence, confidence, and organization. Various methods of training--roleplaying, situation analysis, strategy game, street-speaking, guerrilla theatre, and discussion-analysis--are discussed in one of the chapters.  Guidelines and frameworks for organizing training are the focus of other sections and, finally, the means for evaluating training are covered. A short bibliography concludes the publication.

        "description":"Major conceptual concerns guiding contemporary political socialization research with children and adolescents are: content of value orientations; nature of the political learning process; sources or agents from which the young acquire their orientations; the acquisition of political and non-political values/skills; impingement of non-political personal characteristics on the development of social and political value orientations; temporal qualities of life cycle and generational variations; spatial qualities of cross-nation and intra-national variations; and implications of value formation and development for the political system. In their desire to comprehend the modal, functional patterns of political behavior in our society, most investigators have avoided the more pathologic  aspects of political socialization. The last half of the paper focuses on high school seniors, their exposure to social studies courses, and the impact of these courses on their political orientations. The author concludes that until such changes in goals, course content, pedagogical methods, timing of exposure, teacher training, and school environmental factors are made, one must continue to expect little contribution from the formal civics curriculum in the political socialization of American pre-adults.

The rationale is focused on the effect physical structure has on the processes and functions of urban life. Recognizing the need for a method or process to examine city forms, the study of urban geography in conjunction with other social sciences was utilized. The concepts of urban geography and its relationship to anthropology, sociology, economics, history, political science, social psychology, and geography provide background for the approach to the topic. Concepts of each discipline are listed to present a suggested framework of objectives. General objectives and criteria are briefly recounted, but final  selection of concepts are left for the 1971-72 developmental phase of the curriculum.

Utilizing developed criteria for the selection of concepts and recognizing the skill requirements for concept teaching, six units were developed, forming a conceptual hierarchy: Concepts of 1) Nuclear Groups, 2) Neighborhood Community, 3) Urban Community, 4) Regional, 5) National, and 6) International Interdependence. Units are intended for ages nine through twelve, are to be taught sequentially, and require 2-3 weeks per unit. Objectives from the  cognitive and affective domain, along with intellectual and social skills, are considered in structuring the instrumental content, placing greater emphasis on teaching for cognitive outcomes. Intended learning outcomes are not stated in behavioral terms. Suggested instrumental content, activities, and materials are described in the appendix. &quot;A Conceptual Framework for the Social Studies in Wisconsin Schools,&quot; Madison, Wisconsin, December, 1964, provided the team with ideas that helped develop the basic concept of interdependence.

It was submitted that involvement through direct observation and experience enable students not only to discover common problems which now exist in most urban communities, but also to channel their energies into seeking solutions to those problems. Grade 11 students visited Chilliwack (near Vancouver, B.C.) to study its characteristics, population, economic factors, and the general way of life and  attitudes of the residents. Four weeks were required for planning, organization, field study, and classroom evaluation. Materials included show the development of the project.

Through the misfortune of deafness it was possible to study some matters of learning and communication which involve only the language of action. The author also makes observations about the principle of choice as it contributes to learning when there is richness in the environment and children are using their innate capacities for choice. The basic purpose of the project was to see if language skills can be developed or improved by concentrating upon the syntactical meaning of words. The approach of the demonstration was to program information and the development of ideas in an effort to have the children understand the function of a word within specific  sentence structure. Simple, manipulative materials were provided for the children. Experimenting and exploring by the children gave rise to the concepts, i.e., a clear plastic tube with water from which the concept &quot;bubble&quot; grew. (Author/VLW)",

A third consideration, The Curriculum Context of Population Study, discusses the four general strategies for curriculum innovation, and points out which ones are  most desirable and feasible. In addition, ways in which population study would complement certain areas of the present social studies curriculum are noted (for example, in area studies, economics, history, community studies, and geography).

Teachers who had demonstrated an interest in population studies were contacted to determine what they have done in the classroom, how, with what results, and what kinds of materials/assistance they felt were needed. Responses are statistically indicated and discussed. A survey of school administrators of various levels is discussed in the next section. They were asked: if they considered population growth, its causes and consequences, important for young people to know; if they considered information on population dynamics an important/appropriate element in the curriculum; and  whether they would support integration of such units into existing curricula. Over 95% of the responses were affirmative, however numerous qualifications accompanied this support. Other questions dealt with curriculum change processes, willingness to support materials development, and mechanisms for teacher training. The final section of the document deals with recommendations for next steps. These fall into three categories: 1) using existing network of interested persons/institutions; 2) the need for special teacher training; and 3) the need to assess available materials so that the best of these can be made known and available nationwide.

New vocabulary, ideas, and ways of applying the ideas help students learn to use critical thinking skills in clarifying issues. Chapter topics are: Describing the World Around Us; Testable Statements; Proof Process; Value Judgment; and Argumentation. The first three chapters focus upon identifying and naming different kinds of statements  according to definitions, specific claims, generalizations, statistics, explanations, hypotheses, and evidence.

The other, an investigation carried out in the schools in 1968, included sending a part one questionnaire to each geography department head and a part two questionnaire to each teacher devoting one-half or more of his teaching to the subject (Appendix A). This investigation shows, in terms of time allocation in curricula, teacher qualifications, facilities available, or any other major indicative factor, that the general position of geography in one kind of school does not differ greatly from that in another. (Appendix B). Four major characteristics of geography in English secondary grammar and comprehensive schools  are: 1) geography is an important subject in the curricula; 2) geography teaching is a profession in which teachers are specialists; 3) the nature of secondary school geography is extremely complex and broadly conceived by many geography teachers as cutting across the physical and social sciences; and 4) geography is taught because ignorance of the world is considered inexcusable. The appraisal concludes that geography introduces students to a systematically organized picture of the world. (Author/SJM)",

        "description":"This report covers the first year of the pilot program described in SO 002 228. The basic objective of the project is exploration of the meaning of environmental education at the community level. It aims at a K-12 environmental curriculum that is sequential, integrated, holistic, process-, field-, problem-, and community-oriented, and initiated through in-service teacher education. A year-long teacher training workshop consisted of five parts: Entry, Environmental Perception, Attitudes and Values, The Educational Environment, and Environmental Education Curriculum. Participating teachers wrote curriculum packages embodying their concepts of environmental education in their respective subject areas. The effect of the training program on teachers was monitored with a pre-post test,  also given to a control group, which showed a change in the experimental group's values towards idealism and humanism. Efforts were made to involve the community in the public school aspect of the project. It was concluded that the critical element of district level curriculum revision is teacher training, that specific qualities of the environmental education curriculum can be identified, and that these qualities are difficult to attain because of the present organization of the educational environment. Further work on the problem is recommended. (Author/SJM)",

Interviews with these students and with less-educated fellow islanders were taped to: 1) ascertain which aspects of the aboriginal belief structure, as preserved in oral tradition, have been most resistant to change; and, 2) an attempt to establish if the students are fairly representative of their traditional belief and value system despite their American-sponsored educations. Some of the findings were: that student belief in, and knowledge of the old mythological and  cosmological constructs was generally low; that belief was high in magic, native medicine, and spirits; and that young and old alike were receptive to attempts at cultural preservations. The report contains a summary of the study, a discussion of study background, a description of methods used in collection of the folktales, analyses of the oral traditions, 16 references, and a bibliography containing over 100 entries.

The characteristics--religion, social classes, family structure, education, agrarianism, urbanism, philosophy, ideology, violence, economy, the military, public administration, political parties,  representation and voting, and affluence--are then analyzed narratively to provide concrete examples of how the general concepts can explain commonalities among Latin American societies, with special reference to the political consequences of the characteristics.

In addition to developing the teacher directed reading and discussion approach, the research sought to determine if attitudinal change would occur in both urban and rural schools. One hundred and four whites ages 7 to 7 served as subjects; half of whom were from urban and half from rural schools. Both schools contained experimental and control groups, the experimental one reading texts with equal emphasis on urban and rural settings and participating in classroom discussion about Black feelings, situations, and contributions. \"An Attitudinal Questionnaire Concerning Black  Americans\", the instrument used in the pre-test and post-test, measured the white children's attitudinal change toward the Negro. The basic conclusion drawn from the experiment is that reading and discussion of multi-ethnic social studies materials can influence attitudes toward Black Americans significantly in white urban children, and favorably in rural children, suggesting that racial harmony can be fostered in a classroom.

It is defined as the process by which the student investigates the nature and meaning of population processes and characteristics, the causes of population changes, and the consequences of these for himself, his family, his society, and the world. Its goal is to assist students to conceptualize the relevance of population for themselves, and to assist them thereby to make rational and responsible decisions about population matters. To achieve this, relevant concepts and materials need to be integrated into the curriculum in a systematic way. Population education shares knowledge/skills with several other fields, but has its own logic, structure, and goals. It is concerned with  developing understanding as well as exploring values. Conclusion-oriented and open-ended educational programs are contrasted and discussed. Emphasis is placed on value-fair approaches in which a student is viewed as an inquirer. There is no evidence that anything near an adequate population program now exists in American schools. The Office of Education's role in the development of population education is assessed and found wanting.

This exploratory device, which reflects cognitive preferences in terms of students' dispositions to respond consistently to either particular or general features of data, uses multiple choice wherein 4 options (each representing a different form of cognitive preference) are provided for each of 40 social science principles. To test the 4 study hypotheses, 2 student groups were used: 1) 8th graders (some 7th graders) from the University of Illinois Social Science Curriculum Study Center (SSCSC) Project who had been taught with project-developed materials requiring inductive strategy; and, 2) master's and doctoral candidates in education  who were enrolled in a course on social studies curriculum and methods. Results suggested that the test can identify student differences in cognitive preferences within a particular curriculum context. The report of the study provides a conception of cognitive preferences, a step-by-step account of test construction, empirical analyses of the test in terms of such factors as reliability and validity, recommendations for research, a bibliography, a copy of the test, and a description of the SSCSC Project.

The purpose of the paper is to describe a new psychological perspective on moral conduct, and to discuss some empirical findings which follow from this perspective. Morality is regarded here as a natural phenomenon which considers understanding of moral behavior to be dependent on knowledge of man's biological and psychological nature. The implied assumption is that an evaluative tendency is an integral part of social conduct and, moreover, that moral conduct is social conduct. Definitions are provided for morality, moral behavior, and moral character. Five important aspects of character development that are pertinent to the explanation of moral behavior are: moral  knowledge, socialization, empathy, the ethics of conscience vs. the ethics of responsibility, and autonomy. Each of these dimensions is defined in terms of a specific assessment device, and the relationships among the scales are examined. (Author/SJM)",

The structure of geography is an interrelated system of values, concepts, and skills which become meaningful and useful to learners only when applied to the analysis of geographic problems. Misinterpretation of geography by curriculum makers in Alberta has probably occurred because a majority of departments stress the physical domain and fail to communicate the true nature of their subject to  non-geographers, and because geographical concepts have changed over the years. The basic research traditions of geography, consisting of the physical, cultural, regional, spatial, and political, can, if properly taught, stimulate analytical and decision-making interests in students. It is concluded that the geographical method of inquiry must be taught because of the probability that such instruction will produce in students some of the analytical skills of the social scientist and will educate people to observe their environment analytically, thereby seeing the totality of a place in some comprehensible form.

In considering the emerging structural requirements for commercial agriculture, it is noted that agricultural economists have extolled commercial farmers to match the organizational integrity and performance levels of the industries from which farmers buy and into which they sell but that farmers are reluctant or unable to do this--possibly because the models the economists use do not reckon with all of the behavioral considerations. Emphasizing the need here for input from rural sociologists, the  authors call for full commitment from both disciplines and for a synthesis of conventional wisdom entailing both economic and noneconomic considerations of major magnitide. Other recommendations include increasing dialogue between economists and sociologists; involving economists and sociologists in the same research problems; and developing a joint major in agricultural economics and rural sociology at the graduate level.

In the Greek family, a closely knit patriarchal unit, the majority of children end their education at grade six and find a job to supplement the family income. Primary schools, comprised of six grades, are compulsory and free. The one-room school environment is formal and authoritarian. Secondary and private schools are confined primarily to Athens and a few provincial  centers. Secondary education consists of the six-year gymnasia, preparing students for professional roles and higher education, and a few privately operated technical/vocational schools. Higher education is offered at two universities, two poly technical institutes, several technical schools, and teacher training colleges. Related documents are SO 003 443 and SO 003 447. (SJM)",

Emphasizing the collection of background information on the overall student population, an extensive Student Background Questionnaire was administered along with a battery of group ability tests and the use of teacher ratings. Basic frequency distributions of responses appear in Appendix A. A random selection of 25 percent of grade 5, 7, and 9 classes in the Toronto system was designated for the sample in an attempt to provide norms and material with which the reader may generalize to students in Toronto schools. In the data presented, response differences to a few of the  categories of the questionnaire are clearly evident between Canadian Born and Non Canadian Born as to their &quot;degree&quot; of exposure to English; numbers of students who received instruction in English as a second language; the formal maintainance of language other than English; rural and urban background of students; and education background of parents.

The basic design to develop the observation system involved the analysis of transcriptions of group discussions of controversial issues. The resulting observation system included tentative criteria for two sets of subcategories for two independent components of activities, operation and content. The 13 operation subcategories included, for example, Stating, Challenging, Interpreting, and Integrating. The 11 content subcategories included, for example, Value Terms, Criteria, Facts, and Value Judgments. The criteria developed for the subcategories were tentative  since certain strategic and conceptual difficulties encountered in carrying out the design made it virtually impossible to obtain reliable criteria. An interpretation of value discussions involving resolution of value conflict was based on two fundamentally different but related games, namely the rationality game and the ego game. The aims and roles of the ego game involve winning or persuading, whereas the aims and rules of the rationality game involve achieving a solution to value conflicts which maximizes the values of the participants. Implications of the study were discussed. (Author)",

The major focus of the research was to determine the relative effects on learning of two teaching techniques: one using 70% knowledge-level questions and 30% higher-level questions (Treatment A); the other using the reverse ratio (Treatment B). Secondary variables relating to sex, school location, and the interactions of treatment, sex, and school location were also examined. One hundred eight second-grade children were selected from a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area, and were randomly assigned to the three groups (one control group--Treatment C). The three groups received six weeks of instruction from experienced elementary teachers. The content involved the concepts of  rules and location. No texts were used; all materials were presented visually and the children responded orally to questions asked by the teacher. Findings were that: 1) children in Groups A and B performed significantly better on the achievement tests than Control Group children; 2) Group B achieved significantly better than Group A; 3) no significant effect was found relating to the sex variable; 4) suburban children did significantly better than urban children; and, 5) no interactions among the variables studied were found to be significant. Conclusions and implications based on these findings were discussed. (Author/JLB)",

Taught in the United States in conjunction with other disciplines, or perhaps not at all, geography is emerging as an all-embracing science and as a bridge between physical and social disciplines. A primary recommendation is for geography to align itself with the environmental sciences--rather than social studies--or to assert itself as an independent subject. Education of geographic technicians, improvement of the tools of the science (maps, photography, atlases), and perfection of new techniques in  graphic representation are immediate needs. Computerized operations offer a new key to data reduction and perhaps will dominate scheduling of priorities. The challenges of our earth, as well as the challenges of the solar system, give the science a new impetus and a new direction. (Author/JMB)",

This concept provides a basis for the elementary and secondary social studies program. Although the concept of human dignity was promoted with the signing of the Magna Carta, in reality society is not too concerned with the individual and human dignity. Program goals are to help each student develop a positive self image; and understanding of various groups of people; critical thinking skills to evaluate evidence and come to a logical conclusion; and experience in choosing between alternative values. Teaching approaches are future-, role-, and process-oriented, emphasizing inquiry methods to  examine social problems and controversial issues. Classroom micro-societies provide students with opportunities to work together in groups. Course content focuses on ethnic studies and incorporates topical multi-media materials. Through the study of the social sciences, the student will demonstrate a growing appreciation of human dignity. (SJM)",

A pragmatic secondary objective was to further stimulate a systematic dialogue concerning the city's agenda and priorities for the immediate future. One hundred and six community leaders and decision makers responded to a mailed questionnaire about 28 potential changes. Several changes were in education. Additional options could be specified by the leaders and they each selected issues considered central to the community's future, describing what ought to be done or avoided.  Data on each change is analyzed in this summary and it is concluded that the data points to a very high receptivity to change among these Pittsburgh leaders.

Two classes regularly taught at two high schools were compared with two experimental units, emphasizing: 1) each student's introspective analysis of his own political socialization; 2) an exploration of elitism, political linkage, and institutional racism; 3) an examination of case studies of political change; and, 4) individual student fieldwork (community involvement). Data was gathered from pre- and post-tests, indepth student interviews, and analysis of classroom interaction. The conclusions supported the hypothesis  that schools can become a potent agent of political socialization among students. Those from the experimental classes revealed a higher incidence of understanding, involvement, and response ability. Future research includes a survey of student activity prior to the November 1972 election. Implications for social studies teachers' influence on student attitudes (ethnocentricism, racial prejudice, tolerance for dissent, and attitudes about social change) are apparent. (JMB)",

This survey of research oriented literature probes the relationship between home environment and achievement. Social class, power-structure, child-rearing practices, religious affiliation, and parental attitude in the home are identified as environmental factors that can be positive or negative influences upon academic progress. If a student problem caused by value conflicts between home and school is understood by the educator, various steps can be taken to help the child acquire motivation to learn and an appreciation of long term goals which school and society have set for them. Among the research  findings are the indications that high academic motivation and achievement are prevalent among children from: 1) small, middle-class status, protestant families; 2) families in which the parents are college educated; and 3) families in which the parents are moderate in power in child rearing. Since these studies indicate that achievement motivation is learned in the home, the implied need is for educators to foster special programs for children with different value systems and to encourage active participation of the parents in school.

This research study attempts to explore, through the use of simulation, why this reluctance occurs and to identify relationships of specific variables of teachers' expressed willingness to adopt innovations. Four samples of elementary classroom teachers, totaling 165 drawn from schools in Texas, responded to an instrument which included information and posed questions indicating teacher interest and willingness to use innovations. Three social studies innovations of progressive complexity were described to these teachers, asking them to assume the real life situation of deciding whether to adopt innovative programs. Two strategies employed in the data collection sessions were the\"intervention mode\", in which group discussion was encouraged, and the \"non-intervention mode\", with each teacher working alone. Results indicated that the three innovations were not perceived alike; rather, the majority of teachers were less willing to use programs considered to be more involved and demanding. Interest, peer support, and the characteristics of the innovations are also important to teachers in considering adoptions of new programs. This study reflects and supports a growing body of research and theory supporting planning for change to insure success. (Author/SJM)",

Papers express the participant's views and identify some principles and techniques for utilization in secondary schools. It is important for social studies teachers to understand present-day transatlantic interdependence. Major emphasis is upon how the teacher can present to secondary students various historical and contemporary aspects of United States influence on Europe and how schools can provide these students with intellectual tools to understand the world as it changes. Titles under which ideas are presented include: The Socio-Cultural Impact of America on  Europe; Problems of the Atlantic Economy; The American Involvement in European Security: The Impact of U. S. Foreign Policy on Europe; Symposium on the Teaching of American History; America in the Classroom: American Studies in British Schools; An American Point of View; and Comments on the Seminar. Lastly, there are several sections with source materials for the teacher and addresses for teaching aid and information. (Author/SJM)",

In an anthropology course, urban high school students are introduced to the definition of culture, an examination of culture integration and of anthropological objectivity (no superior or inferior cultures, only different cultures); concepts which assist them in comprehending to some degree the structure, the complexity, and the  mechanics of their own culture. A second major goal of the high school anthropology curriculum is the development of academic skills (inquiry, critical, analytical) as they pertain to anthropology. Public school teachers, and social studies teachers in particular, all exposed to students with different subcultural backgrounds, need an awareness of anthropological concepts. Anthropologists can contribute significantly to teacher education and to the development of classroom materials, assuring assistance to teachers and students alike. (JMB)",

Participants stressed that many child-rearing practices, educational methods, and social work practices are predicated on unsupported assumptions about how people evolve their moral values and ethical standards. The discussions were intended to provide an interdisciplinary effort to digest and absorb what is known about moral development and the acquisition of values and to construct a variety of working concepts of morality on the basis of the most reliable scientific and  philosophical evidence now available. A single theme predominated--values can only be meaningful when examined in the full light of their psychological, social, and historical context. Numerous theories were advanced: the influence of social attitudes, kinship relationships, behavior conditioning, attitude consistency from generation to generation, rapid social change and resulting psychological experimentation in a search for stability. Lack of universal definitions is a major handicap--terms relating to values or morality are surcharged with emotion and no adequate scientific model for study exists. (JMB)",

Understandings are demonstrated under suggested pupil and teacher activities followed by sources of primary and supplementary materials. Students are oriented to the concepts of poverty, it's physical, mental, and psychological realities; followed by attitudes toward and factors contributing to poverty, and concrete attempts to assist.  Remedies include: educating the poor to consumer pitfalls, destructive marketing habits, consumer credit deception; and instructing them in insurance, housing, service, and legal rights. A game, Market Maze, has an emphasis on good buying habits. Student awareness of problems faced by ghetto dwellers such as limited shopping facilities, lack of day care centers, and ignorance of available assistance should contribute to helping the poor make better use of their disposal income.

        "description":"The political learning of 2,584 children enrolled in elementary and junior high schools of southern California is explored in this report. Growth patterns of Mexican-American and Anglo-American children are studied and comparisons are made in their political orientations. Data were obtained by questionnaires administered in grades 4-8 after the general elections of 1970 and in January and February of 1971. The analysis of children's responses focused on: 1) knowledge of political information; 2) attitude toward political authority; and, 3) orientations toward citizenship role. Principal findings indicate that as a group, Mexican-American children acquire less political information than their Anglo-American counterparts whether responses are analyzed by ethnic background alone, or  by ethnic background and sex, social status, and level of ability. The gap between the two ethnic groups tends to widen as children progress through the grades. Mexican-American children of lower socioeconomic status are highly cynical about responsiveness of government to their needs and anticipate unfair treatment from policemen and judges. Fewer Mexican-American children have internalized norms associated with political involvement. At certain points in the report suggestions are made to educators concerning children's curricular needs in political affairs and the unique needs of the Mexican-American child. (Author/JLB)",

Three divisions of study are presented: 1) a rationale for the examination of schooling and moral development, 2) the development of procedures for analyzing the use of explanations, and 3) speculation on the basis of pilot test results about the direction that future research might take. The rationale for the study presents a review of two perspectives in socialization literature. The sociological perspective addresses the manner in which social mechanisms impress themselves on individuals as a means of perpetuating the social order. The psychological perspective concerns the manner in which children incorporate their social environment.  An adequate study of the influence of the school on the moral developments of the child is also presented. Procedures developed included a modification of the Kohlberg free-response interview paralleling a technique developed and used by Rest (1969) and a modification of the school-specific \"Clarke Barto Incident,\" developed by Nordstrom and Friedenberg. Data were collected for the purpose of instrument development, not to demonstrate anything about the schools.

The first aspect concerns distinct conditions of similarity and variance among elementary schools as perceived by students. Differences between how students and teachers review schooling are investigated. Finally, the relationship between behavior of the school principal, the school staff, and educational environment is documented. Research data were collected from almost 10,000 students in 90 demographically different elementary schools. Findings resulting from an analysis of data from this sample were used to describe environmental similarities and differences. Fifty-four schools were randomly selected from a sample of all elementary schools in Massachusetts. The Elementary School  Environment Survey (ESES) was administered in the remaining 36 selected schools. Student responses from these schools supplemented with perceptions from 600 teachers were also used to examine the educational environment. Results of the study indicate several specific similarities and differences among elementary schools, significant differences between students and teachers in their perceptions of educational environment, and an existing relationship between desirable educational environments and principal and teacher behavior.

These programs  include a pre-school program which resulted in a community day care center, juvenile court companions, companions for the aged, a telephone referral service, tutorial programs, youth workers, instructional aides, and recreational activities for retarded children.

The first part reviews the present condition, developments of compensatory education, the implications of future developments in other areas of education, and value judgements. The second part, implications for teacher education, concerns the forces and trends effecting education. Also included is an outline summary of what content might be offered to future teachers to support the compensatory education movement and the likelihood of such content actually being offered. The final section includes an annotated bibliography on teacher education and  further selected bibliographies on teacher education, compensatory education, selected programs and demonstrations, selected project descriptions and discussions, compensatory programs and demonstrations, selected project descriptions and discussions, and compensatory programs.

The Liaison Teacher-Returnee Counselor Project was designed to provide continuous support to delinquent juveniles after their release from state institutions. Former teachers from the institutions and special counselors in the Milwaukee public schools helped to bridge the teenagers readjustment to the regular school system. The three main components of the project included prerelease activities, programming and orientation after release, and continued supportive counseling. In 1970-71, the project was expanded to include a summer program. Chapters of this case study concern general information, program planning, program management, implementation of  the program, budget, and program evaluation. Results of the program indicated the recidivism rate for returnees in the project decreased each year, the number of days survived at school increased, and attendance improved. A subjective evaluation is included. (MJM)",

Detailed explication of its development will be presented in subsequent reports. Separate presentations will be prepared for each system element; selection, diagnosis, and placement; programmed training; practice; non-programmed training; assignment and followup; assessment; and system revision. Provisional decisions have been made to focus the model system on the vestibule training of public school teachers in skills generalizable across content areas of science, mathematics, social studies, and English for grades 3-12. It is noted, however, that the  training system should be of use at many points in a continuing program of preservice and in-service teacher education. Initial steps have been taken to clarify design problems concerning the particular kinds of skills to be included in the training system and the means by which the system can be made adaptive to individual institutional, and community needs. These design decisions and problems may also be the subject of subsequent reports. A seven-item bibliography is included. (Author)",

Data are presented separately for each grade and for 15 Title 1 versus 35 non-Title 1 schools. Included are correlations within each school year showing teacher consistency in mean residual gains produced across three successive school years. Although gain scores were computed with a simple linear model and several key factors could not be controlled, the stability coefficients obtained compare favorably with those previously reported and suggest that teacher consistency may be higher than previously suspected, at least among experienced teachers working in their usual fashion with their  normal classes. Studies of such teachers who are stable over time in their relative effectiveness are needed to discover the teacher behaviors that are related to success in producing student achievement gains.

        "description":"School decentralization in New York City has been avidly watched nationally by educators and governmental decision makers. School decentralization was regarded as a necessary reform, if not a panacea and has had a long history. For three decades, educational reports stressed the need to divide large urban school districts into smaller more efficient units. The decade of the sixties witnessed several important studies, among them being Mayor Lindsay's attempts to obtain a legislative mandate to decentralize city schools, and the Bundy Report. In reviewing the history and present status of decentralization in New York City, several questions arise: How did the school decentralization law affect the recruitment and selection of board members? How did the legal matrix set the  conditions for community boards to function? And, finally, how did these community boards pursue their policies in three key areas--personnel, budget, and curriculum? In addressing itself to these questions, this report comes up with some recommendations for legislative changes in decentralization law. (Authors/SB)",

Sample population included black, American Indian, and Spanish Surname students. Returns were received from 99 percent of the admissions officers at institutions surveyed. Three year trends which have emerged indicate that black freshmen enrollment has leveled off to 4 percent in 1970 and 1971, after a rise from 3 percent in 1969. Despite the apparent intentions of many colleges and universities, fewer blacks are entering college. This study was intended: (1) to examine the amount of social change in our society as reflected by the number of blacks and other minority students  entering primarily white universities as freshmen; and (2) to determine what universities are actually employing in selecting black and other minority students in order to shed light on the relationship between research and practice.

This review of literature examines the role of these community colleges in occupational education in terms of methods of operation and extent of offering. Occupational preparation at the secondary school level is insufficient, which puts a heavier responsibility on the community college. One problem in fulfilling this responsibility is the financial limitations of the 2-year colleges in setting up proper training facilities and equipment. Literature on entrance requirements and characteristics of enrolling students, curriculum, administration, and methods of instruction are all discussed in this report, which  should be of interest to community college administrators, curriculum planners, and educators.

Insight into these practices and needs was accomplished through a questionnaire survey completed by 3,229 vocational-technical educators in seven states, covering items such as: (1) institutions used as sources of information in the past 12 months, (2) usefulness of sources of information, (3) usefulness of information products, (4) most important characteristics of information, (5) time spent each month gathering information to solve problems, (6) familiarity with ERIC, and (7) ERIC materials used. One of the several conclusions and recommendations is that  vocational-technical educators at the local level--teachers, counselors, local directors, administrators--are in need of better access to information products and services, especially preceding the beginning of school terms. Means for improving access are recommended. Also, the single hypothesis that vocational-technical educators who were themselves enrolled in courses would show distinctly different patterns of information gathering behavior was rejected. (JS)",

First year objectives included efforts to: (1) plan and develop limited operation of vocational-technical programs, (2) establish technical advisory groups in the skill areas, (3) individualize the curriculum, (4) provide inservice training for staff, and (5) enroll one-fourth of the student body or 250 students in an occupational development program. Major accomplishments of these efforts included: (1) More than 130 persons were involved in the initial planning of the program, (2) By September 1970, 14 courses had been initiated and some 300 students enrolled, and (3) Staff  development was furthered through two workshops in 1970-1971 for all program staff. A major recommendation of the report is that the middle school area of career orientation and education should be fully developed during the second year program. (JS)",

Data pertaining to the skills taught were obtained from 278 high school vocational education teachers. Analysis of the data revealed little similarity of instruction among the vocational education areas for the skills studied. However, 15 of the skills were taught at similar levels by teachers of two, three, or four of the vocational areas. The study further  notes that the small number of similarities of instruction tended to support the establishment of comprehensive vocational education programs in local attendance centers. (JS)",

Phase 1 of the project (1970-1971) sought to help a number of Colorado school districts develop at least one vocational teacher as a resource person on the vocational problems of youth and adults with special problems. A total of 30 vocational teachers were brought together in a variety of meetings and were encouraged to conduct projects that put them on a one-to-one basis with youth, adults, parents, teachers, and others in alleviating the vocational problems of the disadvantaged. Outcomes  resulting from Phase 1 activities include a distinct change in the attitude of participants, continuation or development of projects for the next year, high degree of awareness on the part of the participants' supervisors, and descriptions of projects conducted by participants. Phase 2, planned for 1971-1972, will seek to establish teams in the school districts which will concentrate on special projects in vocational education for youth and adults with special needs. The teams will be set in target areas where the need is great. (Author/SB)",

However, upon examination of existing clustering systems for relevance and possible adaptation, no one system met all the criteria. Therefore, a new clustering system was devised by synthesizing useful features of existing systems. The proposed system has two crucial dimensions--one stressing functions and contents of occupations, the other emphasizing status or levels of occupations. The proposed clustering system was planned to fulfill three instructional functions: (1) inform students about the world of  work, (2) assist students in choosing a suitable career, and (3) provide models to shape instructional objectives and learning experiences.

To document the installation, personnel involved in the consideration of the innovation were interviewed, and a chronological narrative of events was constructed. In addition a questionnaire was developed and mailed to 31 cooperating institutions which had Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC) microfiche collections. Concepts from the change process were used to analyze the data. The Havelock linker model served as a frame of reference for discussing the roles of the information center in the state education  department and cooperating institutions. Despite four drafts of the proposal to the Commissioner of Education, a coordinated information network was not fully implemented during the 31 months of this study, which illustrates the difficulty of installing a complex innovation in a bureaucratic organization. However, the decision to implement the network has been made. Several principles of innovation installation were supported by evidence in the study. (Author/SB)",

It is premised on the idea that an excessive number of children are being processed by and unnecessarily referred to juvenile courts, that the harm done by contacts with these courts far outweighs any benefits gained, and that the contacts often exacerbate the problem of delinquency. The approach to delinquency should be one of control rather than one of treatment and prevention. Models designed to divert problem children from juvenile courts include: (1) the school model, which, besides the family, is a major  socializing agency in society and therefore, a prime institutional focus for defining and channeling child and youth problems, (2) the welfare model, which completely replaces or functions in lieu of a juvenile court, (3) the law enforcement model, which consists of specialized organization, practices, and techniques used to adjust problems of juveniles without court action, and (4) the community organization model, which brings the other three models together. Each of the models is described in the monograph. (SB)",

In the process of determining content, a review of relevant literature was made, and a theoretical framework was developed which consisted of an integration of Leavell and Clark's levels of prevention approach to health care, and Maslow's hierarchy of needs personality theory. This theoretical combination resulted in 25 categories, each labeled with a level of prevention and basic human need. Within each category, competencies needed by a nurse in occupational health care were identified, and corresponding academic content was identified and delineated into educational levels (baccalaureate,  graduate, and inservice). The theoretical framework was then utilized to assess the content of one baccalaureate nursing program. Data were collected by observing classes over a 3-year period, and a content analysis was conducted. Findings revealed that the theoretical framework provides a method for structuring the curriculum desired and that the methodology can be applied to all aspects of the nursing curriculum. In addition to content analysis, items for an achievement test were developed and a standardization process was started. (SB)",

The study concludes that the city's slow employment growth has been due to a failure to compete with suburban areas for new industries, rather than inadequate growth in existing industries. A policy of attracting new industry is not considered feasible, because economic forces deter business expansion. The findings indicate that policies should  be directed toward increasing the productivity and mobility of ghetto residents. Programs such as training and urban transit systems should be given priority. (BH)",

Based on analysis of data collected, it was revealed that there are significant differences in perceptions held by students and by workers toward employment in distributive occupations within general merchandise department stores. The study further revealed that the poor work perceptions of youth are a contributing factor to low enrollments in the vocational distributive education programs. Recommendations include the need for: (1) occupational  information programs, (2) field trips, (3) basic business courses and junior high school exploratory programs, and (4) the realization among teacher coordinators that disadvantaged students prefer work to welfare.

A random sample of 20 rural high schools in northwest Michigan with less than 400 students in Grades 9 through 12 was divided equally into a control and an experimental group. Vocational teachers from 18 of the schools participated in the study. Two Likert-Type scales were used to measure teachers' attitudes toward teaching the disadvantaged and the attitudes of the disadvantaged students toward vocational education. An additional instrument was developed to determine teachers' knowledge about teaching disadvantaged youth.  Following an in-service program, teachers were again tested for attitude and knowledge. From the findings, the study concluded that an in-service teacher education program can significantly increase the effectiveness of vocational education for disadvantaged students in a heterogeneous classroom and should be encouraged. Finding that there were often too few disadvantaged students in any one class to justify a separate class for those with special needs, the study recommended that programs for the disadvantaged in small rural schools be part of regular vocational programs.

        "description":"This analysis examined the major differences in patterns of occupational achievement of blacks and whites during the first decade of labor force experience after last leaving full-time schooling. In large part, the analysis was designed to examine differences in the processes underlying the attainment of two dimensions of achievement, status, and income. The analysis showed directly what the earlier separate analyses of status and income had implied: for whites, status is the dimension of occupational achievement to which background resources are more fully directed, while for blacks, income is the dimension toward which these resources are utilized. The difference between blacks and whites holds both for the initial job and for the job held 10 years later. The strategy of  whites--using background resources to obtain jobs in which status is higher relative to income--has long-range implications not just for status but for income, to a much greater extent than is true for blacks. This difference between blacks and whites in the utility of background resources is especially evident in the case of educational attainment. A related study is available as VT 015 025. (Author/BH)",

One group took the regular, published version of the SDS, while the second group took a version of the SDS which did not contain the &quot;self-directed&quot; aspects. The third group served as a control, receiving no treatment. Evaluative criteria were selected that would assess the special effects of the SDS as well as effects commonly expected from more typical vocational counseling procedures. Results revealed that both versions of the SDS were effective in increasing the number of  occupations being considered, but students taking the published version were considering more appropriate occupations based on their activities, competencies, interests, and self-ratings than those who took the non-self-directed version. In addition both versions of the SDS were effective in increasing satisfaction and certainty about vocational plans, and the effectiveness of both versions was evaluated as moderately positive by the students. Sample student interest questionnaire, opinion form, and vocational guidance questionnaires are appended. (Author/SB)",

        "description":"This analysis of income changes is based on retrospective life history data collected from white and black men, 30-39 years old in 1968. Educational level is shown to be the most important determinant of initial income for both blacks and whites, but the relationship is weaker for whites than for blacks. Ten years later, education shows a stronger relation to growth in income for whites than for blacks. The differential impact of levels of education and other background resources on initial income and income 10 years later is examined. For initial income, black resources are more efficacious than those of whites, but the greater average resource levels of whites creates an initial income difference in favor of whites. Ten years later, the efficacy of white background resources  for income growth is greater than that for blacks. Intervening events and experiences, whose efficacy favors blacks, keep the income gap from becoming even wider. A comparison of this income analysis with a previous analysis of occupational status suggests that whites may be using their resources to obtain jobs with a high status, with the expectation that the job status will in the long run bring high income, while blacks are doing the opposite. Testing of the effectiveness of such a strategy (if it is a conscious strategy) indicates that it is effective for whites, while it would be much less so for blacks.

The problem is defined as the question of how and why existing information comes to be considered \"useful\" by practitioners and how it is subsequently applied by practitioners. In the literature that has been generated in the area of educational diffusion, adoption and utilization of information, three basic approaches have been isolated: the research, development and diffusion perspective, the social interaction perspective, and the problem-solver perspective. The dominant perspective has been the research, development and diffusion model. Research on the subject of  information utilization is described as loosely organized, university-based, individually directed, theory oriented, committed to experimentalism, conducted primarily by persons trained in a psycho-statistical tradition, and a part-time pursuit. The point is made that when considering the role of media in education, one should distinguish between the commercial mass media and media used as teaching devices in the classroom. The final conclusion of this review is that the communicational perspective of the present study finds a fair amount of theoretical and research support in the extant literature on knowledge utilization in education.

The curriculum of the Institute was designed to utilize fully a variety of instructional methods and techniques in order to provide a sound sequence of learning experiences which would equip the participants to plan, organize and conduct ABE programs, to acquire understandings and insights into problems faced by participants in ABE programs, to plan and conduct teacher training institutes, and to evaluate ABE programs. Basic theories  of administration, program development, and evaluation were presented and discussed by authorities in these fields. Participants examined and explored the presentations through practicicums, small groups, and large group discussions. The Institute was evaluated in terms of participants' attitudes and participants' response toward it. Conclusions include: (1) At least one week of the program should be held in a secluded residential setting; (2) Future concern in ABE; (3) Exploration should begin as soon as feasible into the possibility of the utilization of Regional Educational TV; and (4) State Directors of ABE should continue to share actively both in the planning and the conduct of summer institutes.

        "description":"A program for adult basic education is presented. The general concepts underlying this program are that the teacher will review material covered in the preceding lessons and will be reminded of the overall purpose of the instructional package. Behavioral objectives of the program are: (1) The teacher will take the second diagnostic self-test for personal evaluation; and (2) The teacher will be able to list the more salient points covered in the preceding lessons. Factors which were considered in the conduct of this program include: (1) Attendance is voluntary and determined by a practical motive; (2) The adult is an impatient learner; (3) The adult must acquire and retain a high degree of self-confidence and must have a feeling of success to a far greater degree than children;  and (4) The adult has handicaps which he must overcome--physiological changes, psychological handicaps of prejudice, set patterns and habits, fatigue resulting from a full day's work prior to class. Materials used included six transparencies, one audio tape, and one diagnostic self-test. Activities included: (1) The teacher will view the transparencies and listen to the tape; and (2) The teacher will take and score the diagnostic self-test. The self-test will comprise the evaluation.

The approach utilized by this project is that of an individualized learning center which incorporates paraprofessional teacher, self-instructional learning materials and community resources to build a curriculum suited to individual needs. Major concerns of MAPAR include: (1) identification of the educational needs of the Mexican-American and other educationally disadvantaged, (2) advancement of the family as a unit educationally and culturally, (3) vocational exploration and enculturation, (4) development of social skills for community acceptance, (5) self-identification of the  Mexican-American historically and culturally, and (6) knowledge of customs and laws of Anglo society. Initial areas of concentration included organizational development, establishment of facilities, personnel requirements and responsibilities, development of community cooperation and support, materials selection and development, and evaluation and dissemination activities. Findings include: (1) The original design of the project proved to be fundamentally sound for the under-educated Anglo-American and the Anglo-sized Mexican-American who has adopted middle class values towards education; and (2) The design was inefficient in meeting the needs of the Mexican-American migrant or ex-migrant with little or no language skills in English.

More than 70 participants took part in the institute. On the basis of follow-through activities and evaluations of the Institute, it is concluded that: (1) Teacher turnover in ABE is high; (2) Teachers need intensive pre-service orientation to ABE and continuing in-service training; (3) The quality of ABE and the effectiveness of teaching it are subject to qualitative and quantitative measurement and evaluation; (4) At present, there are few career ladders for  professional development in ABE; and (5) Teachers need most to be able to effectively teach basic skills, provide subject matter and materials relevant to the needs of disadvantaged adults, individualize instruction, apply a wide range of adult education methods and techniques, and effectively serve in the roles of counselor, diagnostician, evaluator, resource specialist, and designer-manager of learning experiences. The importance of these conclusions to future teacher training programs is presented. (Author/DB)",

Consequently, the Institute was designed to provide as many human and material resources as possible for use by the State Directors in analyzing the magnitude of their tasks, their individual and collective roles, and in developing imaginative \"plans of action\" to maximize the effective use of resources in adult basic education. The participants in the Institute were involved in a variety of pre-conference planning activities prior to their involvement in a human  relations-problem solving 2-week residential workshop. The major objectives of the workshop were to enhance the creative capabilities of the participants, to perfect their communication, perceptual and problem solving skills, and to put into action innovative ideas to help overcome certain problems which inhibit the impact and effectiveness of adult basic education.

Specific aims of the study were: (1) to determine the relationship between participation in ABE and change in anomia, (2) to determine the extent of anomia among rural Appalachian adults with educational deficiencies, and (3) to determine the relationship between demographic factors and anomia of ABE participants. Ten hypotheses were tested. Using the Srole Anomia Scale, data were collected from seven classes in four different locations in rural Appalachia (four in Eastern Kentucky and three in Northern Alabama). The median age of the subjects was 30.5 years; the mean age was 31.4 years. There were 26 females and 11 males in the  sample, 59.4% being married. Nearly one-half of the subjects had completed 7 or 8 grades of school before dropping out, and over 60% were employed. The mean anomia pretest score was 3.5 and the mean posttest score was 2.9. This change in anomia scores implies that ABE students see the program as a means of removing obstacles to the achievement of their goals. No significant relationships were identified between the demographic factors, age, sex, marital status, educational level, and employment status and anomia. A significant finding was that students who remained in the adult program had significantly higher anomia scores than did drop-outs. (DB)",

The study was designed to study the effect of differing statistical treatments on the coefficient of correlation. Data generated in an experimental framework included conformity scores and dogmatism scores; conformity was determined by use of Asch's Vertical Line Scale and dogmatism was determined by Rokeach's Dogmatism Scale. The dogmatism data were treated in two ways: (1) as a total score, and (2) as individual sub-test scores. Using the total score, a zero order correlation technique was employed to determine the coefficient of correlation between dogmatism and conformity. Such a treatment yielded no significant correlation.  Employing the independent scores of 17 sub-test areas of the Dogmatism Scale and a multiple correlation statistical treatment, a significant coefficient of correlation resulted. (Author/DB)",

The NABE is operating in 15 communities with a total enrollment of 350. Five instructors with assistants are employed to work  directly with the participants. Approximately 18 hours of week of classroom instruction is given, In-service training was provided for the staff. Navajo Community College's contributions to the project were made in a variety of areas, such as: faculty participation in the in-service training; provision of audiovisual materials and the production of a film; payroll, budget, and financial services; the loaning of vehicles; library services; public information and publicity services; the provision of Navajo culture consultants; and groups from the Navajo Studies Program, Nursing Program, and Home Economics Department were involved.

Thirty students were trained to work in teams in 19 communities. The project successfully demonstrated that rural people who need basic education can be involved through a person-to-person approach and by using imaginative methods of teaching. Of the 175 participants in the project, 49% made good or fair progress as compared with 11% who did not show significant progress. In addition, services were provided to meet basic needs in areas of practical education, such as  community agency referrals, job information, and other educational opportunities. Additional training for STABLE teachers was indicated and has been incorporated into the current program. (Pages 50, 51, 53, 54, and part of 68 will not reproduce because of illegibility.)

The goals of the workshop were to: (1) inform participants about the need for professional preparation in teaching Adult Basic Education; (2) inform participants about research relevant to organizing teacher education programs; (3) help participants develop in-service training plans that they could use at their respective institutions; (4) help participants develop measurement and evaluation skills with which they could judge their own Adult Basic Education programs; and (5) provide a place for participants to exchange ideas, opinions and findings, and to develop  specific plans of action to initiate at their institutions. The 32 participants in the workshop were from 26 institutions from 20 states west of the Mississippi River. The four papers presented at the workshop were: &quot;A Report on Reaching the Undereducated in Salt Lake City&quot; by Suzanne Weiss, &quot;Report of the Southern Regional Education Board Project in Adult Learning&quot; by Charles E.

The report presents, in tabulations and figures as well as in text, results of the questionnaires in the following sections: Adult Basic Education at State Level; Local Programs; and Community Awareness. As seen by the State Director, the strongest aspect of the Adult Basic Education program are the teachers in the local programs, and the weakest part is the lack of personnel in the State office.

The program was implemented in three phases during FY71: (1) Planning and Commitment, (2) an Adult Education Workshop, and (3) Consultation. Of the 25 institutions funded by the Institute, 23 were conducting follow-up activities related to the Institute's goals. At 7 institutions, 19 new courses were added, and 5 new degree programs were started. Five other institutions not funded by the Institute have entered into  consortiums with members of this project. It is estimated that more than 600 people have attended workshops and meetings as a result of the Institute's activities. It is concluded that the response to the Institute suggests that a serious need for such a program does exist and that the Institutes activities have increased the awareness of that need.

The first paper aims to create greater awareness of the change agent's communication behavior, to make strategies of changing people more into an object of conscious deliberation and less of an art by discussing some of the central elements of the communication process. The second paper, which is a revision of papers delivered at the 18th and 19th International Course on Rural Extension, deals with aspects of change agent behavior which affect contact outcomes. Four \"do's\" for change agents are suggested: (1) Collect and use feedback; (2) Be client oriented; (3) Use a non-directive approach, especially when identifying your client's problems and way of thinking; and (4) Give careful  thought to the nature of proof you offer a client.

        "description":"The work of this Panel for the Evaluation of Experimental Literacy Projects was the assessing of how the pattern of evaluation it had previously formulated had been applied in the Experimental World Literacy Programme (EWLP). In the judgment of the Panel, by 1974 evaluation specialists will be able to present a report that will enable Member States to make a reasonably well-founded judgment on the value of functional literacy and on the efficiency of various means of achieving it. It is stressed that the full effects of a successful functional literacy program may not been seen for a decade or more. It is also the opinion of the Panel that by 1972, it should be possible to see on a limited scale the extent to which some programs have changed traditional practices in agriculture  and industry. In addition to use of proposed indicators in the Standardized Data Reporting System to evaluate the EWLP, it is recommended that other material be collected also on qualitative and organizational aspects of the program. The Panel also urged that all projects work in close cooperation with the responsible authorities to facilitate the eventual transfer of pilot projects into national structures. The Panel felt that functional literacy works best when closely related to specific development objectives. The distribution of a costing manual to all projects and more research by universities are seen as needs. (DB)",

On the basis of 1,000 replies received, it was found that: (1) about 84% of those who did not complete their courses had paid for uncompleted courses, and had not been reimbursed; (2) of the 160,000 veterans who did not complete correspondence courses, it is estimated that 134,000 incurred costs of $24 million for the uncompleted lessons; (3) most veterans had enrolled in correspondence courses to learn new skills, to improve existing skills, or to earn more money; (4)  major reasons given for not completing the courses were: insufficient time, loss of interest, the courses were not what had been expected, and the courses were too difficult; (5) only about 1% took advantage of VA education and vocational guidance; (6) over half of the veterans said that the VA should provide more advice and assistance on course requirements, the value of a course to an applicant, the number of veterans completing various subjects, and their suitability for certain courses or vocations as determined by aptitude tests.

        "description":"This study gathered information in regard to the extent to which public school districts maintaining a secondary school either operated or planned to develop an adult education program. Information was gathered from all 329 public school districts maintaining secondary schools. Of the 329 schools, 132 indicated that they had an adult education program, while 197 reported that they did not have such a program, but 140 of them indicated that they would like to develop an adult education program. The study determined how many administrators and teachers were involved in the adult education programs and the types of courses which they were teaching. Information was also secured as to what additional courses schools maintaining adult education programs would like to offer as well as  proposed courses which schools would offer if they could develop an adult education program. A final question dealt with the physical location of adult education classes. The study suggests that there is a moderate amount of adult education activity now underway in Nebraska public schools and that there is considerable interest in and a potential for additional courses in existing programs and for the development of new adult education programs. The study also suggests that there are many individuals involved in administering and teaching in adult education for whom experiences in formal and informal education activities in adult and continuing education would be desirable.

        "description":"Change agencies have to choose among a number of possible goals, such as a rapid increase in productivity or the personal development of their clients. Possible strategies include giving orders, provision of means and services, directive advice and non-directive help. The conditions under which each can be chosen and the consequences which can be expected are discussed briefly. Probably non-directive help will make the greatest contribution to the development of people. In order to be effective, a change agency should give much attention to the system of communication within the agency, and between the clients and the agents, to the motivation of the staff to work hard in the interest of the clients, to the coordination of activities within the agency and with other agencies, and  to the flexibility in adjusting at changing situations. Giving orders and provision of means and services requires probably a rather hierarchical structure, whereas non-directive help can best be given by an organization with a participative pattern of leadership. One study found, however, that agents under authoritarian leadership are more willing to listen to their clients. The effects of different patterns of leadership in various cultures require further research. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"Research was conducted to determine the continuing education needs of clergymen in Michigan, particularly their most crucial ones, and to ascertain which needs might be met by programs of state-supported colleges and universities. Another objective of the study was to have the clergy identify major roles in their profession. From a total of 1,504 questionnaires mailed, 791 usable ones were returned. In general, the 40-49 year age group was typical of the total group of clergy studied. The older clergymen seemed to be significantly more conservative and apparently has less social consciousness than did those in the younger age groups. This was true in their perception of clergy roles, their perceived continuing education needs, and in their attitudes towards public universities  conducting educational programs for the clergy. From the results of the study, it appears that the clergymen feel that counseling is a major part of their work, and that they need additional education in order to be effective. Their expressed need for continuing education in such areas as human behavior, marriage and family life, social problems, and communications is seen as further support for the conclusion that it is primarily in the area of helping people in relating to others that clergymen feel they require assistance. Nine tables present the collected data. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"A national study of methods and materials used in teaching reading by adult education teachers was conducted. The purposes of the study were: to determine from ABE, GED, and ESL teachers the most popular methods, materials, and techniques currently in use for reading instruction in adult education; to determine the \"goodness of fit\" between the difficulty of the materials in use and the reading levels of the students being taught; to determine the reliability ratings of materials used for reading instruction; to determine what kinds of supplementary materials are used to augment direct reading instruction; to determine the teachers' beliefs as to why it is important for adult students to learn to read or to read better; and to determine what books the teachers believe every adult  in their class should read. Responses obtained from a questionnaire completed by 240 adult education classroom teachers (176 of which were analyzable) in 43 states provided the data for the study. Conclusions based on the results of the data analysis are: (1) there is no suggestion in this study that any single publisher or any particular material type used for adult basic reading has control of even a minor proportion of the market; (2) several factors suggest that the quality of reading instruction may be lower than optimum; and (3) ABE teachers may not be motivating their students to read.

Subjects were 228 seventh graders who had not previously mastered the four geometry concepts-quadri-lateral, rhombus, trapezoid, and parallelogram. A complete description of the experimental procedure is presented. Results show that students in the expository groups spent less time studying the lessons than those in the discovery groups, yet had superior immediate acquisition scores and equal retention scores. The superiority of the expository method is thus indicated, at least for the  dimensions measured.

Secondarily, the study explored whether a developmental relationship exists between logical thought and field independence. Eight male and eight female subjects per grade were randomly selected from class lists for sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth grades and classified according to cognitive developmental level. All criterion problems (to be solved) are fully described. Sex and age differences are discussed.

The single major dependent variable was the students' attitudes toward a busing program which transported black students to their schools. Results show: (1) that white students who experienced equal status contact with blacks prior to the busing program and those who associated with the bused students in school activities were more likely to  have positive feelings about the busing program; and (2) contact with bused students in the classroom was not related to tolerant attitudes.

The questionnaire is analyzed item by item and all egalitarian responses are graphed. In general, the author discovered that systematic and significant differences exist. Social class was found not to be a factor, while sex of the respondent and grade level are important. Thus, females and upper grade students are more likely to give egalitarian responses than are males and lower grade students.

Among the changes discussed are: (1) redistribution of counselor functions; (2) a heavier emphasis on non-college bound students; (3) more personal and family counseling; and (4) inservice training for counselors. The authors indicate that, because of such changes, a sound high school counseling service is emerging. (TL)",

The study, utilizing a nonrandom sample of 60 female college sophomores, was designed to test the feasibility of teaching behavior patterns which facilitate problem-solving in diverse situations. A basic model was used which included problem sensing, problem defining, hypothesizing, searching for information, and resolving. Differences between experimental and control groups show that problem-solving skill training does facilitate problem solving. In addition, some support is given to the position that training in general problem-solving skills results in a person's being able to better solve problems in diverse  situations. The author concludes that it might be more effective to teach inquiry as a set of abstract routines which function to support and enhance mental processing in a wide range of fields. (TL)",

A key component of this psychology involves the hypothesized effects of advance organizers has not been adequately evaluated. Previous investigations, while of theoretical interest, have merely demonstrated the equivocal nature of a poorly defined pedagogical tool in a number of situation-specific research settings. The present study attempted to rectify this state of affairs by: a) developing an operationally defined advance organizer, and b) testing the effects of this treatment relative to a traditional prose organizer in a cross-sectional research designs. Subjects in grades six through twelve were randomly  assigned to three treatment conditions: graphic organizer, prose organizer, and control. Materials were aimed at the ninth grade population and held constant across the seven grade levels. Analysis of the data revealed no significant differences in favor of the organizer treatments as any of the seven grade levels. Apparently, within-grade subject variability negated the potential effects, if any, of the advance organizers. (Author/RK)",

It was based on Murray's Needs-Press model and contained 30 scales of 10 items each, totaling 300 items. The expectations of the present study was that the scales of the CEI would exhibit adequate discriminates among different classroom environments. Three forms of the CEI were administered to different samples. The following findings were reported: (1) The item discrimination indexes for the  first two forms were adequate but somewhat lower than other Syracuse Indexes, while the discrimination indexes for the third form were considerably improved; (2) the reliability co-efficents were low in the first two forms, but considerably higher for the third form; (3) finally, it was found that the CEI scales differentiated between classrooms, subjects, grades, levels, and to some degree sexes.

The paper suggests that the young need to be provided with a variety of skills so they can more easily and effectively make the transition to adulthood. The role of the school should be to provide only intellectual skills, while other skills may be more effectively learned through active participation in the occupational institutions of society.

Resent evidence on the facilitative effects of imagery in paired-associate learning suggested to the experimenters the use of performance on a paired-associate learning task (in which imagery was used as a mediator) to corroborate self-reports of covert responding (imaging). In an attempt to increase or decrease the frequency of imaging, subjects were either reinforced or punished for self-reports of specific associative methods. Data indicates predictable frequency changes in imaging as a function of external contingency arrangements.

Subjects for the first study were children ages 5-7, 8-10, and 11-13 years; in the second study, college adults were tested. Generally, subjects took more trials to learn matching problems than oddity problems. For the younger Ss: (1) oddity problem solving improved with age; and (2) matching problem solving in girls, but not in boys, improved with age. In the adult Ss, no sex differences in respect to problem type were observed. A model of matching and oddity problem-solving is presented which proposes: (1) that problem-solving involves the utilization of appropriate response strategies; (2) that a hierarchy of response strategies develops  and the dominance of the hierarchy remains fairly constant across ages once established; (3) consistent matching responding involves suppression of the domanant oddity strategy; and (4) the mediation of inhibitory responses of more dominant responses takes time.

Also discussed are the objectives and methodological problems associated with the four domains of research to be explored before an objective basis for preconstruction predictions can be established. These domains are (1) response formats, (2) media of presentation, (3) observers, and (4) environment. The previous research of the author in this area is then outlined, including the presentation of a 2-stage conceptual model of meaning (or comprehension) consisting of a representational stage followed by a responsive stage. The  author describes one experimental study that compared the meanings attributed to environments by architects with those attributed by laymen, the findings of which revealed that the education of the architect accounted for the differences. Another experiment compared architects in different parts of the country and found similar, albeit less systematic, differences. The presentation concludes with a discussion of the current research of the author in which the adequacy of various media as representations of designed environments are compared. (Author)",

The material is organized into 35 chapters or &quot;patterns.&quot; A pattern is a package of design requirements whose solution is focused on a distinct part of the physical environment. This part can be a physical activity space -- e.g., a kitchen, an entry, or the action area of the play yard; it can be a part of a building -- e.g., the lighting system or the flooring materials; or it can be an overall design issue -- e.g., a multirealm environment for mother and child. The patterns should be a takeoff point for the director, the teachers, and the architect to begin thinking about the daily program for a center  and the parallel requirements for a physical environment. These patterns can also be considered as part of a continuing dialogue between early childhood educators and architects who take the time to articulate their ideas on educational needs and required physical solutions. The patterns are transitory and temporary, to be modified and changed as the dialogue is vitalized with new ideas and insights. (Author)",

Societal changes that the author sees are (1) an interest in consumerism and environment, (2) a trend to urbanization, and (3) a transition from a complacent to a questioning society. (JF)",

Organizational specialists in Kent, Washington, met with many difficulties because of budget and personnel constraints, but they did succeed in improving the communication and problemsolving skills of district subsystems.

The study was intended to gather information about the adequacy of these various facilities from the standpoint of the users. Questionnaires were given to all teachers and principals, to randomly selected 5th and 6th grade students in heterogeneous classes, and to randomly selected parents and neighbors. In addition, observations of all students and teachers were made in 12 schools over a period of one week. There were differences both in satisfaction with and utilization of facilities, some favoring SEF schools  and some favoring nonSEF open plan schools. However, the differences from school to school were generally much greater than the average differences between types. The large, overriding differences were generally found between the open and the traditional plan schools. (Author)",

The analytic framework is then applied to two cases of organizational change in a high school, some of the implications of the framework for researchers and change agents are  discussed, and the framework is compared to Lewin's force field analysis.

One hundred and eighty-one Pennsylvania districts where board members are elected as Republicans or as Democrats were studied and data were subjected to chi-square analysis. Five hypotheses were tested to determine if the partisan phenomenon changed this relationship.

        "description":"This speech presents a brief history of public sector collective negotiations and compares collective negotiation to private sector bargaining. The author points out that, unlike private collective bargaining, the public association or union cannot put the employer out of business; therefore, a strike or a strike threat is no longer a viable weapon in the arsenal of the teachers' association. The author suggests that school boards adopt a policy of \"modified Boulwarism\" -- based on the negotiating tactics of a General Electric vice president in the 1940s. Under such a plan, a school board would present the teachers' association with a carefully considered and researched offer that fell within the goals of the school system. The school board would consequently make very few  changes at the bargaining table unless the association, on the basis of research, could show that the offer was inadequate or undesirable in any aspect. According to the author, this method precludes unseemly gamesmanship in which both sides make many demands and charge each other with irresponsibilities. (Author/JF)",

In a follow up study of 364 of the graduates, stuents with high enrollments in the arts (art, music, and drama) were compared with other students on the basis of achievement in high school academic subjects, enrollments in college arts courses, and college grade point average. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to determine the effects of high enrollment in each of the high school subject areas on grade point averages in college academic subjects. In addition, the number and distribution of high school academic subject units earned by the sample students were compared with the entrance requirements of 200 colleges and universities to determine if study school students  could enroll in more arts subjects and still meet the specific subject requirements of colleges with selective admission policies. Results showed that with I.Q. and sex variables controlled, enrollment level in high school arts subjects had no significant effect on either high school or college grade point averages in academic subjects. Students with high arts enrollments in secondary school had higher arts enrollments in college; high enrollment in the arts neither aided nor penalized students in academic subject area achievement.

The emphasis is on assessing school input-output relations that appear to be maximizing educational outcomes. The standard constrained-maximum model is formulated for the schools where output is reflected by a verbal achievement measure; inputs are composed of student characteristics, personnel attributes, facilities, and organizational variables. The model is applied to a sample of white 6th graders attending schools in a large, eastern city during 1965-66. However, the model  also carries strong implications for those dealing with the problems of inner-city and low-income area schools. One of the major implications of the findings is that evaluation results for any group of schools may not be generalizable to any particular school in the sample. The possibility of constructing efficiency rankings for schools to find out which ones are obtaining the largest outputs for their resource is also explored. (Author)",

In general, researchers found that appointed school boards are heavily represented in northeastern United States, tend to have a more black representation, are more likely to be nonpolitical members of the local elite, are more concerned with school policy and more active in the schools, tend to have more conflict with their superintendents, and are less active in lobbying with other political officials for school support. In addition, appointed school boards are more likely to be desegregated  in large cities with large black populations, elected school boards more likely to be desegregated in small cities with small black populations, and appointed school board members seem more realistic in their perception of the difficulty of improving schools and the necessity for learning to live with conflict about school affairs.

The two tools are Delphi -- with its modification, Focus Delphi -- and Cross-Impact Matrix -- with its modification, the Cross-Purpose Matrix. The Focus Delphi is a tool to help planners identify existing consensus and dissensus among various groups in society. The process systematically collects perceptions of interested publics and keeps separated their responses about the goals and needs under examination. The Cross-Purpose Matrix brings the proposed strategies of the several goal advocates into the open to aid priority assessment. This process arrays the  competing goals in a matrix and forces an examination of the relative value of each with reference to all others. Related documents are EA 004 240 and EA 004 241. (RA)",

The CIM is a research method designed to serve as a heuristic device to enhance a person's ability to think about the future and as an analytical device to be used by planners to help in actually forecasting future occurrences. The author makes no judgment about CIM's usefulness as a heuristic device; but he does fault it as an analytical methodology. He partitions the analytical problems into two categories: (1) theoretical -- including questions about underlying assumptions of the model, the meaning of inputs, the ability of experts to perceive accurately, and the ability of mathematics to handle the inputs; and (2) practical -- including invalid  mathematical formulae and questionable use of simulation techniques.

As basic research is developed and applied to practical problems, these individuals act to communicate this knowledge to those who may need it. In some cases, these change agents may also assist potential adopters in the installation of the new idea in their system. This paper investigates certain aspects of the relationship between these change agents and potential adopters. The paper focuses on educational change agents and practitioners in school systems, particularly as they interact to bring about improvements in the functioning and effectiveness of educational  organizations.

A change agent must establish a relationship with a client system, diagnose the client system, select the correct helping role, determine change objectives, deal with resistance to change, and maintain the changes. Within each of these tasks, the administrator can choose a change agent from inside or from outside his organization, can select a single-person change agent or a team, and can decide whether the change agent is similar to members of the client system in attributes or different with respect to certain traits. The optimum change agent role employs the team concept, uses both  internal and external personnel, and utilizes agents with greater similarity to other members. (RA)",

Representative commentaries concern intervention on the family and school levels, parent participation, individually prescriptive oral and aural programs, use of aides in stimulation of residual hearing, inductive approach to learning, and classes for deaf blind children. The second presentation contains 47 slide commentaries on the coordination of a statewide staff training program and is designed for three audiences of professionals and nonprofessionals serving the  preschool child and his parents, parents, and allied resource specialists in health, education, and welfare. Selected slide commentaries focus on various educational projects and conferences for concerned adults, state meeting conference, parent counseling techniques, and sequential program of auditory training. An informal evaluation of the staff training program indicates that the program has been influential in increasing professional and public interest and action in early childhood education programs for the aurally handicapped.

In general, the projects were found to be successful. The overall project summary characterized the projects as growing projects that have brought about a noticeable improvement in the quality of instruction. (CB)",

The study focused on three major activities: identification and description of children known to have special needs who are not being served by official agencies; descriptions of life in classrooms, institutions, and other special settings; and development of programs, recommendations, and legislative proposals. The first part of the report, Project Summaries, covers sample exemplary programs, an observational survey of programs for the retarded, social experiences of newly committed retarded children, language stimulation in state institutions, a survey of facilities and services for children with multiple sensory disorders,  school-age children not in school, and analysis of Massachusetts' statutes regarding children with special needs. The second part of the report presents recommended legislative reforms, including acts relative to full reimbursement for special education programs and to creation of a new State Department of Child Development (with cost estimates).

The term radical accelerates is used to describe gifted students who jump from junior high to college education, bypassing the high school years. Briefly described are two widely known and successful radical accelerates, Norbert Wiener and Charles Fefferman. Presented in greater detail are case histories of two boys who are current radical accelerates. Methods used by the authors in seeking out mathematically and scientifically precocious students of junior high school age are explained. Possible disruptive effects of academic acceleration are considered, with particular reference to social and emotional development.  Previous literature on acceleration is referred to, although little study has been done on radical acceleration. Radical acceleration is seen as the method of choice for some, but not all, extremely able students; alternate possibilities are also mentioned. (KW)",

Population included 120 subjects equally divided by sex into two groups of retardates and normals and subdivided into socially reinforced and non-reinforced Ss. The task measured overt or instrumental dependency (ID). Electronic stimuli ranging from 2 to 10 pulses per second were judged by subjects as slow or fast values. Subjects had free access to the anchor values (2 pps as slow, 20 pps as fast) to assist the decision. ID scores were based on frequency of anchor use. The Rohde Sentence Completion Test measured covert or emotional dependency (ED). Finally, a learning task based on the concept of opposition was presented. Results revealed higher ID scores for  retardates, with significant correlations between IQ and ID as well as between IQ and Opposition Task. ED scores were not significant between and within groups. Conclusions include the inference that retardates' need to be reinstructed by increased anchor use prior to a decision influences their learning potential. (Author/KW)",

Two major issues were focused upon in the research: the long term impact of preschool education on later school performance, and relative impact of  preschool education when differing educational procedures on models are employed. Results showed that the preschool experience enabled the children to better proceed through elementary school at regular grade level without retention or special classes.

An experiment was conducted to test whether there is sufficient commonality in team tasks performed in existing team tactics trainers to warrant development of a team training system for specific advanced technologies. Data were collected for team tasks learned in representative training devices for air, surface and subsurface tasks. These data were analyzed for commonality among and within training devices using a numerical taxonomy. Results indicated little commonality when total tasks were inspected, but more commonality when stimulus, cognition, and response elements were compared. A major recommendation is that the Navy concentrate on improving the  effectiveness of existing devices rather than launching a program to develop a generalized training device. (RB)",

This document serves as a yearbook and complete description of the program and its personnel. INDICOM's directors maintained the thesis that instructional innovation must begin with the teachers (who were trained in CAI program design) or it will end outside the classroom door.

The demonstration of the technical feasibility of automated training through the application of advanced digital computer techniques and advanced training techniques is essential before the application of such techniques is warranted. The advanced computer techniques include the incorporation of real time performance monitoring and course scheduling. The advanced training techniques center on the feasibility of adaptive training based on performance measurement reflecting operational performance requirements. Automated Ground Controlled Approach and emergency procedures tasks were implemented on the Naval Training Device Center-Training  Device Computer System (TRADEC system) and tested with operational pilots. The results demonstrated the feasibility of automated training as well as the acceptance of the training technique by operational personnel.

A study was done to see if the medium used in the codification process has an effect upon data obtained, and if so, what the nature of the effect is. Codification consists of the translation of observed behavior into analyzable data. Classroom verbal interaction is defined as the verbal behavior of students and teachers in the classroom. Four possible media for data collection about this behavior are direct observation, audiotape recordings, videotape recordings, and typescripts. The experiment showed that for certain verbal behaviors the medium used in the observation did exert a significant influence on the data obtained. However,  these effects did not become more pronounced with increasing complexity in the system of behavioral categorization used. A major conclusion was that, with the exception of typescript, factors such as cost and ease of data collection should be given primary consideration in choosing a medium. (RB)",

        "description":"Three new teaching techniques, using established principles of learning, were combined to teach an introductory digital computer course to college students. The techniques were: 1) programed instruction; 2) Fields-type teaching tests, &quot;a discrimination method to teach concepts by modifying the examination procedure to emphasize similarities rather than differences,&quot; and 3) the proctorial system of instruction (PSI), or self-paced instruction. At the completion of the course, 86 percent of the students said they preferred this system to conventional lecture. Advantages of this method are that students appear to learn more, use of proctors is less expensive than use of instructors, and materials can be developed by the teacher while he is teachin the course.

Few recognize, however, that the change agent is a member of a formal organization whose norms and values often diverge from those of the clientele system. This paper attempts to conceptualize the nature of communication between two systems whose norms and values diverge from one another and to determine the possible effects such communication can achieve. The concepts developed are applied to the problem of auditing the effectiveness of an organization's communication with its clientele. Research evidence from studies conducted in Colombia show the importance of the organization in determining the  behavior of change agents. Evidence is presented to show the nature of communication between organization and clientele by anti-poverty agencies in the United States and the nature of inter-organizational communication within a community. Finally, a theory of inter-system communication is developed and concepts and measuring devices are presented for auditing the effectiveness of extra-organizational communication. (Author/JK)",

The background and nature of the program, its resources, and the activities it has undertaken are outlined. User experience in applying augmentation tools and techniques to various normal working tasks is described so as to convey an impression of what it is like to work in an augmented environment. The conclusion is drawn that this type of working-support, computer-aid systems for augmenting individual and team effort is going to be widely developed and used. Multi-access computer networks are seen to be especially important; they will become special marketplaces where a new kind of competitive evolution will take  place, not only in hardware, software, and special services, but also in roles, skills, working methods, and employment dynamics for the intellectual workers at the terminals.

Computers can now interact with users via terminals which may be hundreds of miles from the actual mainframe machine. Many terminals can be in operation at once, so that many users may communicate with the central processing unit (CPU) simultaneously. Furthermore, computer languages are being developed which are peculiarly suited to such remote teleprocessing, and which permit communication in language closely resembling conversational English. The user can also ask supplemental questions and receive individualized answers. Thus, the computer's information is becoming available to any user who has access to  electricity. Finally, costs are being sharply reduced by organizational systems like commercial time-sharing or establishment of user consortiums. Currently, work is going forward on a device which will make the transistor seem as bulky as the tube. This and other developments make the future of computers in mass communications enormous.

Radio and Visual Education Network (RAVEN) was developed so that these people would be provided with the means to find existing alternatives or develop alternatives themselves from the ongoing economic/political/social mainstream. RAVEN is a two-way single sideband radio, operating from a central headquarters on one of the reserves under direction of Indian people, which allows information to be passed rapidly and efficiently to people in the outlying villages. The information can then be passed from village to village; the people can exchange information and discuss it,  get more immediate attention from government departments, and find out how to handle current problems. RAVEN uses videotapes for visual communication, and Super 8 movie film to record cultural activities so that ceremonies and traditions can be preserved. Since people in urban areas also suffer from lack of information about matters which concern them, perhaps this model of two-way information systems could be adapted for use in urban areas.

The basic premise of a moral science is that it is possible for men to reach agreement on what is healthy psychologically, just as agreement has been achieved on what makes for a nutritious diet. A second section of the report discusses the nature of scientific revolutions. Many social thinkers are quoted to explain what happens when one, all-inclusive paradigm for explaining natural reality is given up for another, less complete one which in the end provides more comprehensive and satifactory explanations. Evidence for an impending  change of paradigm is put forth, using the background of research into extrasensory perception and communication. (RB)",

Rather than scrapping traditional practices, graduate programs should continue to emphasize the training of research scholars. The research tradition has justified itself by the advances in communication theory and methodology over the past 20 years. Further, good researchers are the ones most likely to benefit both their students and discipline. One beneficial change would be the movement toward a limited number of centers of excellence-some training humanists, others scientists, rather than continuing with the many doctoral programs now existing. Some programs would do better to stress utilization  of research and the development of teaching expertise, for use in community colleges and inner-city schools. Such a program would be more useful than training every graduate student to do research. (JK)",

This relationship, not the message, is crucial to the development of personal meaning for the information being exchanged. In teaching and in all human relationships, the most positive behavior displays qualities of warmth, empathy, and genuineness. Messages which reveal whether these qualities are present or absent are vital if learning and other good behavior is to take place. They are more important than the technology and audiovisual aids which educators have been most concerned with. What distinguishes a good helper, teacher, or communicator from a poor one? It is five beliefs, which determine  the kinds of relationship that develop between people. These beliefs are: 1) What do you believe is important?; 2) What do you believe people are like?; 3) What do you believe about yourself?; 4) What do you believe are your purposes?; and 5) What do you believe about your methods?

This paper discusses the many variables which affect negotiation situations, in small groups or in large institutions like the university. Specifically, will proper orientation in the bargaining process increase the chances of reaching consensus? What importance is a difference in status between negotiation participants? Contract grading, a process in which the instructor of a course negotiates with the student to determine his grade, is put forward both as the paradigm of an experiment into negotiation theory and as a practical possibility in university courses. Such contract grading would place competency demands on the teacher as the organization's arbitrator and would increase the  validity of generalizing from data obtained in small discussion groups to individuals caught in the formalized status hierarchy of a large organization. Methods for controlling bargaining are discussed with reference to the logistics of the proposed study. (RB)",

Relying on the work of those like Abraham Maslow who follow the view of man as transcendent, the author sets forth her rationale for the assumption that man is a value-selecting animal, in need of a hierarchy of values. The relation of values to actuality, the foundation of a universal hierarchy of values, and the evolution and expansion of the hierarchy of values are examined in detail. A history of hierarchies is traced, leading up to a discussion of self-actualizing individuals and mass progress. The implications of the classical virtues of truth, beauty, and love for the synthesis of  a value structure consonant with a self-actualizing individual are set forth. In conclusion, the author calls for a restructuring not only of education, but of all aspects of society to develop such a hierarchy and to promote institutions which foster it. (JY)",

After the message, subjects were given a questionnaire containing 12 semantic differential scales measuring source credibility and a 10-question multiple choice test. Results of a 2-by-2 (hair style by dress style) analysis of variance showed that the audience did not perceive the long-haired homophilous speaker as more  credible, although they did perceive the casually-dressed homophilous speaker as significantly more credible.

Of central importance in the construction and acceptance of a rumor is a state of high tension existing in the rumor's public during the time of its formation. The widespread rumor that John F. Kennedy was still alive (in a heavy guarded hospital room in Dallas) is perhaps an example of a rumor which formed during a time of low excitement, but which still achieved public acceptance. Probable reasons for the acceptance of the rumor are that 1) it formed a plausible explanation for the incongruous  behavior (with that of her previous White House image) of Jacqueline Kennedy in marrying Onassis, 2) it did not require the public to accept a large departure from where they last saw the president or from his last known--before death--condition and 3) the report was legitimized by nationally or regionally known &quot;authorities&quot; and purportedly by the mass media.

        "description":"A study was devised to examine a subject's level of interpersonal territoriality and disruption of territoriality in small group classroom setting. Through an elaborate procedure, subjects were classified as having rigid or loose depictions of territoriality, and were assigned to small groups with each group having at least two rigid and two loose members. The groups met for one hour: for the first half, subjects were allowed to sit where they liked, while in the second half, subjects sat in a different position and next to someone different. A measure of perceived cohesiveness was taken immediately after the second half-hour. Results showed that, contrary to expectations, there were no significant differences on perception of group cohesion between loose and rigid subjects; that  the sex of the subject did not significantly interact with territoriality in terms of perceived cohesion or cohesion potential; and that rigid male subjects' perceptions of group cohesion was less, but the difference was only marginally significant. Problems that may account for lack of positive results include the operational definition of rigid or loose territoriality, the index of group cohesiveness, the extent of disruption of territory, and the choice of dependent variable.

In the simulation a fictitious town, Freeboro, was faced with a decision regarding a new canning factory. The factory could be seen as a source of jobs and economic stability for the area and as a source of pollution of the nearby Namaskeag River. In a series of four programs, a &quot;news special&quot;, a Town Meeting, a stockholder's meeting, and an Environmental Commission hearing, the viewers were exposed to the pros and cons of various issues. At the conclusion of each program they were asked to vote--by phone or mail--on a key decision.  The results of the vote were incorporated into succeeding programs. It was hoped that viewers would thus become involved in the programs. A fifth program tied the points made in the simulation to real life environmental issues in the state of Maine. The programs were used by high school viewers and home audiences; an evaluation showed that the students were overwhelmingly in favor of the series as a learning experience. The history of the project is detailed in this report along with a discussion of the process of producing and evaluating such a series. (JY)",

This report surveys the various means of implementing a computer resource: commercial time-sharing, small-scale time-sharing systems, multi-use minicomputers, and minicomputer systems. Each approach is analyzed for cost, support required, number of students supported. How the students make use of the resource and its educational limitation are also reviewed. The implementation of high level languages, such as FORTRAN and BASIC, are  considered for their educational utility and the number of students they can support. In addition, a survey of minicomputers and suitable peripheral equipment is appended. Manufacturers and equipments are named and discussed, and prices are also provided.

Data were collected about the types of information of highest priority to the majority of the user groups and the differences between user groups with respect to information wants. It was determined that the majority of users did not possess the same information wants. However, the types of information wants that were common to the majority of the groups  revolved around three questions: 1) what does the system teach?, 2) how does the system perform with respect to carrying out its objectives?, and 3) how is the system used?

The following factors were considered: (a) number of transformations, (b) types of transformations, (c) auxiliary-type sentence expansion and (d) type of query (those designed to elicit responses which should reflect comprehension of syntax versus those designed to elicit responses which should reflect comprehension of sentence meaning). Subjects were kindergartners from the American English speech community of Los Angeles. Since psycholinguistic literature suggested that number of transformations might reflect comprehension difficulty, the conjoined sentences used in the experiment were arranged according to the number of operations or transformations they  exhibited. Results of the experiment showed, however, that number of transformations was not a useful predictor of the speed or accuracy of the child's responses to the types of sentences used. Sentence expansion was also not considered significant. Transformation type seemed to be pertinent to locating problem areas of difficulty in sentence comprehension, but it was not clear to what extent generalizations regarding this factor could be drawn from the data derived from the present study.

        "description":"This curriculum bulletin contains articles relevant to problems in bilingual education for American Indians. The first section includes articles presenting a broad view of past and present activities in bilingual education for American Indians and Eskimos. The history of language instruction in American Indian schools and of bilingual education in Bureau of Indian Affairs schools is discussed along with the Bilingual Education Act and its effect on the American Indian. Two statements on bilingualism appear, and a summary of pertinent research in bilingual education is included. Part Two deals with practical aspects and case studies. One article discusses what classroom teachers should know about bilingual education. Three others discuss programs for Navaho children. The final  section is a bibliography of approximately 70 books and articles on bilingualism written between 1953 and 1971; some of the more important entries are annotated. One appendix provides a glossary of relevant terms. The second appendix presents some linguistic principles for describing language. (VM)",

        "description":"This paper proposes a schema that will provide the analytical clarity needed for generating insights into pedagogical issues and, consequently, for developing curriculum efficiently. The schema has four terms: learning assumption, instructional hypothesis, teaching technique, and teacher performance. A learning assumption postulates that an interpretation on the part of the learner will generate learning of some kind. An instructional hypothesis predicts the condition under which the learner's (appropriate) interpretation is likely to be secured. A teaching technique determines and projects the condition-corresponding behavior on the part of the teacher that is likely to trigger the intended interpretation on the part of the learner. A teacher's performance actualizes the  technique and makes it believable, as an actor makes a role believable. The author discusses the details of the schema and provides examples of interrelationships of the four elements. (Author/VM)",

The idea of basic skills in bilingual education programs cannot be limited to language. The output as well as the input of such programs must be seen in terms of concept as well as of language development. Linguistic, sociolinguistic, and educational factors must all be taken into consideration when defining bilingual education. (VM)",

This comprehension can be sought through Vygotsky's unit of analysis, a unit being a product of analysis which, unlike elements, retains all the basic properties of the whole and which cannot be further divided without losing them. Syntactical rules found in patterns of expression can furnish only partial clues to the thought of the encoder. Interfunctional relations between thought and language cannot be established through an analysis of the components of verbal thought. A mechanical approach, uncovering only thought and word, destroys the whole to describe its elements whose characteristics are in no  way similar to those of the whole. (Author/VM)",

The relationship between a child's acquisition of a language and his ability to think must be better understood for closer investigation of the effects of dual language learning. Several conditions do appear to be conducive to promoting dual language acquisition. It seems that the two languages should be kept in separate contexts so that coordinated language systems might develop. The best language models must be available in both languages. A rich and varied background of environmental encounters is important as are acceptance of the child's uniqueness, respect for his native language, appreciation of his cultural  heritage, and attention to his specific language requirements. Curriculum design for early childhood bilingual education should take these conditions into account and encourage improved oral language ability and introductory literacy skills in the native language, intensive oral language development and readiness for literacy in the second language, and access to knowledge in the stronger language.

This document describes the procedures in developing and evaluating such a reading program. The initial step in the program was to observe Spanish reading instruction in several Mexican schools. Observations of procedures and methods used in Mexico were used to devise a program tested in four locations in the United States. Several forms were developed to standardize the procedures for evaluating the program. Extensive videotaping was done in the four experimental classrooms. The final report on the project shows the results of the observations and evaluations made during the  project and describes the teaching methodologies that were used. This report summarizes the teaching methodologies and the general results of the project. (VM)",

One difference between learning a language in a classroom and in a \"live\" situation is motivation toward communication. The child learning his mother tongue is highly motivated to communicate, as are children hoping to be accepted by other children. To be successful, the language class must become a period of vital communication between teacher and pupils.

The development of the present-day multilingual situation in Malaysia is described. The country is characterized by language islands created by a lack of geographical mobility and insulated through socioeconomic and religious activities. The author discusses the formulation of a satisfactory language policy and advocates that Malay be the language which serves as a symbol of ethnic and cultural identification at the national level, as a means for horizontal mass communication, and as a means of access to science and technology.

The teacher must consider the values of the child and consider with whom the child identifies and for what reasons.

Stable bilingualism can result when each language is used by most, if not all, members of the community for different purposes. In a bilingual situation, societal factors are frequently such that no agreement can be reached as to the role each language should play. One language group may be materially wealthier and force members of the less-fortunate groups to abandon their language as well as their cultural values in order to share the wealth. Bidialectal individuals possess both a socially stigmatized and a prestige variety of the same language. Both bidialectalism and bilingualism as they are found in the United States are mainly of the  transitional type. Both phenomena seem to be marked with some degree of strife or social tension. The resolution of the social imbalances accompanying both situations, however, will probably not be the same. (Author/VM)",

The crucial factor in language learning is the relationship between the minority group and the local society. Among immigrant groups and indigenous minority language groups, interlanguages have arisen containing norms which fall partially between those of the mother tongue and the target language. Economic, social, and cultural variables are at play in the creation of interlanguages as they are among speakers of Black English. Efforts to teach standard English to speakers of nonstandard dialects do not consider societal realities. Most current literature on teaching  standard English as a second dialect maintains that language is the key to social mobility rather than social mobility being responsible for changes in language. Nobody can be expected to learn the language of a social group if, at the same time, he is denied the means by which he can become a member of that group. (Author/VM)",

It is possible to expose all types of goofs, state the rules to correct them, acquaint the teacher with the types of goofs made by persons from all over the world, and give them the grammar necessary to understand and handle them. A hierarchy of goofs can be established by taking sentences with numerous errors and determining which error, when corrected, does the most to make the sentence comprehensible. The most important goofs should be corrected first, one at a time. As a consequence, the speaker can be understood, even if his English isn't perfect. The pervasiveness of aspects of English grammar should also be considered when  deciding what to teach. (VM)",

From the beginning stages, language learning can and should be  meaningful, with meaningful manipulation the goal of early ESL classes leading to communication and meaningful learning. Through communication the learner himself is better able to relate his new language to his own cognitive organization. (Author/VM)",

In the present decade the growth in absolute student numbers will continue and, in many member countries, the relative rate of growth may well accelerate. In the first stage the main method used to meet quantitative problems posed by rising demand was to enlarge existing structures; in the second stage, expansion is creating important changes of kind in the structures themselves--in the size, character and curricula of existing institutions--and by causing increased concern on the part of governments with the size, form, and cost of the postsecondary sector as a whole. This OECD program seeks to review the structural changes now taking place in postsecondary education,  to examine the form and feasibility of various models that are emerging in member countries, and to assist in a more efficient exchange of national and institutional experience.

Hence, the attempt is to relate the instructional service character of the university to the tuition pricing structure of the school. The inadequate fit of the business model for the university has been obvious to many commentators for a long time.

        "description":"Women and men too are becoming increasingly concerned about and aware of sex discrimination in higher education. In the past 2 years, formal charges of sex discrimination have been filed against 360 colleges and universities, none of which have been refuted by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Discrimination exists in all facets of higher education. Women are not hired as professors because of the fear that they will get married, bear children, or not truly be committed to their profession. Women students are not admitted to colleges and universities because it is felt that education is wasted on women or that women do not belong in the professions. Women are even discriminated against in the textbooks where only men are portrayed as having had a hand in changing  the course of history and civilizing the world. It is time for all of this to change, and it is time for men and women to work together to solve the problems that arise as women's traditional roles shift toward greater equality of opportunity.

        "description":"The author of this paper argues that historically and traditionally black colleges must not be subjected to integration and mergers with white institutions because they would then be in danger of losing their black identity. There are 3 interrelated premises that support this point of view. (1) The black college by appropriately interpreting the black experience and by revealing and analyzing the impact of racism, can free both black and white America from the bondage of psychological taboos and misconceptions. (2) The black college's mission is to guarantee that equality of opportunity for all Americans becomes a reality. (3) The black college as a power base can provide the force, the vision, and the resources to promote needed change and to lift the quality of life within the  black community. The author concludes that there is a clear need for both blacks and whites to see distinguished black achievements and to see black professionals in command of a major societal power base. The mere presence of these colleges is bound to affect society's values. (Author/HS)",

There are 8 major dangers that widespread offering of external degrees might precipitate: (1) the deterioration of standards rather than quality education; (2) a proliferation of degrees that might debase the degree; (3) the use of the external degree as a political instrument by legislative committees; (4) the expectations that are being raised in many quarters concerning the degree without solidly developed program plans to support them; (5) the possibility of academic isolation of the student because of the reliance on television, cassettes, and correspondence courses; (6) the grave possibility of lack of relevance in external degree programs; (7) the threat to the  future of private colleges; and (8) external degree programs cause debate over what constitutes an educated person, a consequence that may well turn out to be a helpful development. On the other hand, external degree programs: (1) offer a measure of flexibility and diversification; (2) offer the opportunity for individualized learning; (3) perpetuate the philosophy of lifetime learning; (4) increase the possibility of more community involvement; and (5) offer the opportunity of joining academic institutions with alternative systems of learning.

The results of the study are both optimistic and pessimistic. There seems to be no particular danger of a fundamental surplus in the output of B.A.'s in the 1970's, but we are entering a period of surplus of elementary and secondary school teachers. A definite surplus of master's degrees and Ph. D.'s is also evident, and persons obtaining doctoral degrees with the intention of becoming college professors are in for a rude awakening upon graduation. This surplus, however, is not projected to cause a massive state of unemployment. Rather, underemployment is a much more qualified term for what is predicted. Persons holding higher education degrees will be  able to find jobs, but their qualifications may far exceed the skills demanded by the labor market. (HS)",

One problem confronting the administrator in institutions of higher education is that of understanding the perceptual base upon which institutional members act as they carry out their various tasks and role assignments. This problem is especially critical in newly emerging institutions that are composed of faculty from a variety of occupational backgrounds. The purpose of the present study is to examine a part of this larger problem by identifying the preorganizational career patterns of community college faculty in Pennsylvania  and investigating the relationship between identified career patterns and faculty attitudes toward progressive and traditional educational issues. It was found that academic field, age, degree, teaching curriculum, political persuasion, father's education, professional membership, religious persuasion, sex, and number of children have a great influence on faculty views toward educational issues, in addition to the preorganizational career patterns.

        "description":"This document analyzes and evaluates the exceptional graduate admissions program at Pennsylvania State University as instituted in 1970. Under this program, traditional admissions criteria are dropped to enable disadvantaged students to attend graduate school. (A previous survey of the Council of Graduate Schools showed that 59% of the member graduate schools have adopted similar programs.) On the basis of this study, the changes in graduate admissions policies at Penn State do not appear to adversely affect the quality of graduate programs. It further appears that the individual departments are capable of selecting students who fail to meet certain departmental standards, but nonetheless perform acceptably in the programs. Traditional graduate admissions policies do not appear  to serve their ostensible purpose. They do not seem to afford substantial efficiencies to society by restricting graduate education to those most likely to benefit; rather, they have historically restricted persons from certain social, racial, or economic backgrounds. It would appear that institutions of higher education are coming to that conclusion. In the absence of some otherwise compelling evidence, equal consideration of all applicants would seem to be a wise policy. (HS)",

A second notion is that students with a given level of academic talent gravitate to departments whose demands correspond with the student's talent. It was therefore the purpose of this study: (1) to look at the typical levels of academic talent of persons who succeed in various departments; (2) to observe variations in talent within programs and see to what extent overlap in talent exists among departments; and (3) to see to what extent talent corresponds with mean gradepoint averages across programs. The Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT-M and SAT-V) and the student's high school rank (HSR) were used as  predictors of academic talent. The results of the study clearly indicate that some departments attract students with more talent than do others. However, it is also indicated that the range of talent among students within a given department is also conspicuous. (Author/HS)",

A careful analysis of interdisciplinarity is presented and its impact on teaching and research as adapted to changes in both knowledge and society is examined. It is concluded there is real need not so much to eliminate any of the disciplines but to teach them in the context of their dynamic relationship with other disciplines and in terms of societal problems. The report is in 3 parts. The first, \"Opinions  and Facts,\" presents information collected during an extensive survey of universities on interdisciplinary activities in teaching and research. The second part, \"Technology and Concepts,\" considers the subject within the framework of developing scientific knowledge and the requirements of a rapidly changing industrial society.

The examination provides the basis for the kinds and numbers of credits awarded. Programs in credit by examination are innovative because they recognize that people do indeed learn, either purposefully or incidentally, through their life experiences and, in doing so, should be afforded the alternative of receiving formal credit and, in some cases, credentials for that learning. This document comprises a series of papers that were presented at 3 workshops held on the subject of credit by examination in Salt Lake City, Seattle, and Los Angeles during 1971.

To achieve this goal in postsecondary education, a diversity of institutions for students to attend and the elimination of barriers to these institutions is required. From the standpoint of public policy, the prime need is for a real federal-state-institutional partnership in making equality opportunity more of a reality in this country. Such a partnership alone can assure substantial progress in meeting the needs of students, combined with reasonable, efficient, and effective allocation of existing and future aid resources. In the operation of this partnership a comprehensive program  of student assistance, including opportunity grants, work-study loans, and self-help from students, is essential.

Chapter 1 analyzes the changing philosophies as the nation attempted to address itself to the question: Who should go to college? Chapter 2 deals with the question of who is going to college now and Chapter 3 includes some predictions about who will go to college in the future. A research description of new students in higher education and an analysis of how their  presence should change colleges and universities concludes the study. (Author/HS)",

The recommendations for U.S. research overseas can be summarized in 4 major points: (1) U.S. scholars, universities, and donors have major responsibilities to each other as well as to the larger international scholarly community in the professional conceptualization, funding, and ethical conduct of international studies' research--particularly in the less developed countries. (2) There is a need to promote the internationalization of U.S. social science research through increased international collaboration and funding. (3) There is a need to promote communication and  clearinghouse arrangements within the U.S., as well as on a world scale, relating to international social science research. (4) The strengthening or creation of social science data banks in the less developed countries should be promoted and merits the cooperative attention of scholars from different societies, including local scholars.

The period under consideration is primarily the great era of industrialization in England, from approximately 1760 to 1860. Since this was the first major transformation of the total character of western society to occur historically, the period offers an excellent example of the pattern of institutional response to economic, social, and technological change. The study explores primarily the nature and structure of teaching over time at Oxford and Cambridge. The ultimate goal of the work is to widen understanding of the  social, cultural, and institutional conditions that make communication possible. No conclusions are made in the present report.

Hourly and final exams given to both groups indicate a superiority for students under individualized instruction, which, while highly significant statistically, represents only moderate pragmatic gains. Attitude questionnaires indicate more positive attitudes for students receiving individualized instruction; however, it appears that individualized instruction produces no study skills that the students later employ under the conventional system, and it is no more beneficial for low performing students than for high performing students. It was found, in addition, that those receiving individualized instruction are able to evaluate their mastery of the assigned material  more accurately than students taught by the lecture method. It is recommended that future research be directed at separating some of the many factors that make up individualized instruction so as to identify their relative contributions to this method of instruction.

Each group met every 2 weeks each academic year for a 2-hour seminar. Several teaching techniques were studied, 1 by each group each semester. The participants were evaluated by students through the Purdue Rating Scale for Instruction and the Stanford Teacher Competence Appraisal Guide. Two analyses were made on the data: (1) a t-test over items and participants, and (2) a difference score matrix for each faculty group on each scale for each treatment. Results revealed only a few items of  significance on t-tests and differential effects on matrices. Criterion tests over 2 treatments revealed cognitive changes. Nonintellective effects were evidenced in administrative personnel, teachers, and students. In 1971, faculty members from Memphis State University joined the group in studying proposal writing where the participants submitted proposals to funding agencies. (Author/HS)",

Processes and techniques for collapsing the large number of goal statements to a few detailed positive and negative goal statements are presented. The positive goal areas derived were: (1) small student discussion groups; (2) better learning environment; (3) better instruction; (4) individualized instruction; and (5) better organizational structure. Negative goal areas derived were: (1) faculty overload; (2) administrative misuse; (3) lack of small student discussion groups; and (4) dehumanization of students. These goals in  their final statement forms were derived in view of the perceived purpose of the learning resources center as allowing the community college to respond to increasing student enrollments in the face of diminishing revenues without lowering the quality of education offered. The methodology used to bring about goal convergence is reported in a step-by-step manner so that interested researchers wishing to replicate the study at their institution may do so, and a brief literature review describes some possible applications of Delphi in other areas of education.

In a trial use at East Los Angeles College, the program has shown that attitudes toward school have been modified positively as indicated by a 250% increase in Brown-Holtzman scores and that the occurrence of personal problems have dimished as indicated by a drop in Willoughby scores from the  72nd to the 38th percentile. Also the results of an anonymous questionnaire given to 236 students revealed that the number of students having excessive behavior in certain problem areas, such as smoking, drinking, and drug use, was lessened at the program's end. Actual improvement in grades and number of units completed were found to correlate with the affective changes.

The counseling unit and program were publicized to the community through the (1) establishment of relationship with local, federal and state agencies, (2) involvement of the counselor in various community group activities, (3) recruitment by existing clientele, (4) dissemination of information to local businesses, and (5) use of mass media. Services to clients were improved by considering obstacles to admission by the college from the recruit's point of view. The college's  requirements such as transcripts, permanent residence in the district, and a placement test were modified or made less anxiety-producing for the recruits through the efforts of the counselor. This report also includes the results of a 2-year study of recruits and several recommendations for better relations with those students. It was suggested that an appropriate model for evaluating student persistence be used and the counseling approach be changed from corrective to appreciative. Specific suggestions included: (1) provision of a means whereby recruits can enter the college at anytime during the semester; (2) operation of the unit during the summer; (3) recognition of the need for specialized faculty in the program; and (4) provision for meaningful student reward systems.

        "description":"This review deals with the interest of some junior college educators in taking a stand against the belief that community college enrollments will continue to increase indefinitely. The first stand was made by the Arizona State Board of Directors for Junior Colleges, which called for at least 5-year moratorium on new junior colleges after 1969 in that state. On the other hand, professional state associations, the American Association of Junior Colleges, the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education, and the federal government have advocated the creation of more colleges. Although the idea of a moratorium on new junior colleges is largely unpopular, the current financial crisis may warrant it and numerous population projections reveal a decreasing number of potential community  college students. Reports of studies conducted at community colleges throughout the nation are cited to support this view, as well as results of efforts expended at certain colleges where more efficient use of classroom space has been made in light of anticipated decreasing enrollments.

This document summarizes what is known about this special group of students in California community colleges, especially changes which have occurred since 1967 in the number of disadvantaged students, the number of minority staff members, new counseling and curricular programs, and drop-out rates. The growing effort to attract students, who because of financial problems and lack of necessary preparation have not  attended college in the past, has resulted in great increases in their percentage of the total enrollment. However, many colleges have not provided the necessary special support programs to help the students overcome their handicaps. Consequently, the dropout and failure rate of these new students has been alarming. State and federal money has been and will continue to be crucial for colleges to set up special programs of instruction, student services, counseling, and financial aid necessary for these students. Where such support has been provided, disadvantaged students have averaged the same retention rates, grade point averages and graduation rates as other students. (LP)",

Data from each of seven \"pacesetter\" states (California, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Texas and Washington) and from three groups of states (categorized by the precentage of total undergraduates enrolled in community colleges) were analyzed. Findings in the following areas are discussed: extensiveness of organizational change in community colleges; the groups most concerned about and involved in planning for change; the most popular directions of change; college characteristics; and groups who participate in the decision-making process. Nearly 40% of the presidents plan to change organizational structures by 1975. Student and  community groups are seen by the presidents as having little concern for or involvement in the planning of change. Furthermore, the presidents considered interdisciplinary studies an attractive option for curriculum changes and preferred division to departmental organization. Presidents thought themselves to be the most concerned about organizational change even though they generally believe their patterns of organization are not too rigid, hierarchical, or bureaucratic.

Conclusions reached from the results of these questionnaires include indications that transfer and engineering-related occupational instructors differ in their educational background, the number of advanced degrees held, their evaluation of the importance of application in  technical physics courses, and their opinion of the ability and motivation of occupational students. Differences were also found between transfer and engineering-related occupational students. A greater proportion of the transfer students hope to obtain education beyond the Associate degree; their attitude toward work is more idealistic as opposed to the pragmatic attitude of the occupational students; they were less sure of their reasons for choosing their program than the occupational students; and their education is more often financed by assistance than by employment.

It is recommended that a team relationship be developed between high schools and community colleges to prevent duplication of programs and provide effective service to the community; counseling is at the heart of the process. Several programs which demonstrate such cooperation are reviewed, including concurrent enrollment programs, newsletters sent to high school counselors, subject area conferences, high school advisory committees, and joint workshops of high school and college counselors and admissions  staff. Washington and California have encouraged communication by creating state councils and holding statewide conferences on articulation. Regional planning is also possible; the efforts of the Los Angeles Community College District Area Articulation Committee and regional accrediting agencies are cited as examples. (LP)",

The new program fulfills the review course requirement but emphasis is placed on writing compositions rather than upon reviewing English grammar, punctuation, and fundamentals. Small discussion groups, and auto-tutorial instructional programs are used to assist students in correcting  errors that hinder effective written communication. It was judged that the program's effectiveness should be evaluated before its regular adoption by the college. Use of \"t\" tests for means and proportions were employed to seek out pertinent significant differences between the new program and the existing traditional one.

Conclusions reached concerning similarities between faculty of Harcum and of the three California colleges include: (1) of the three professional values ranked highest, Harcum faculty have  two (honesty and responsibility) in common; (2) in terminal values, each group ranked &quot;self-respect&quot; and &quot;sense of accomplishment&quot; among the top three; and (3) the pattern of major similarities and minor differences in values is similar to results of other inquiries in this field.

        "description":"This report summarizes the detailed case study of the organization and staffing of the research libraries of Columbia University. The study examines present patterns and recommends how the resources of 35 operating libraries ought better be arranged and deployed to fulfill their important roles. As a case study, the conclusions and recommendations are specifically geared to Columbia's unique requirements; certainly, no other university would completely profit from the wholesale adoption of the plan proposed for Columbia. The study may, however, be of general interest to those concerned with possible approaches to organizing for a research library's multifaceted roles in a major urban university. In particular, it is believed that the recommended plan will better accommodate the  widening range of user needs and increasing sophistication of the faculty and student groups served. It should strengthen processes of collection development by bringing acquisition decision making closer to academic planning as well as help users gain more effective access to the constantly increasing volume and changing form of information resources available. The study also discusses the need to develop staff capabilities in library areas which can benefit from application of specialized talents and new technology. (Author)",

At the same time, the program stresses the importance of the planning activity as a central library function. The proposed organizational structure and managerial approaches integrate the input of the several groups with the efforts of individual administrators to develop a productive planning process. This process includes: the formal organization (the library director, the planning-budgeting officer, and unit heads); the seven steps of a planning program; and staff involvement through a senior planning board, a planning task force and program  advisory groups. The steps of the planning program are: (1) Formulation of objectives that can be used to guide future library operations, (2) Assessment of requirements for change, (3) Development of unit plans and alternative courses of action, (4) Determination of required resources for proposed courses of action, (5) Evaluation and recommendation of proposed courses of action, (6) The installation and monitoring of programs and (7) Review and updating of plans.

Classification is defined as the grouping, division and/or sequencing according to meaning, of subject representations such as catalogue or index terms, descriptors, etc. Classification is used in &quot;intermediate&quot; documents (bibliographies, abstracts, indexes, etc.) to arrange entries in a meaningful sequence and to structure the relations between subject terms. Classificatory arrangements used in a number of secondary publications are compared with general classifications and with each other. Classificatory relations used in some major thesauri are also compared with general classifications and  with each other. The general classifications differ from the intermediate documents with which they were compared in two ways: they lack some of the subject terms used by the documents, and differ in some of their classifactory relations (grouping, decision and sequencing). The overall picture is that, although classification schemes do not occur in all intermediate documents, the use of classificatory relations for both arrangement and thesauric information retrieval is widespread.

        "description":"There is a fairly large body of literature on the 1967 Anglo-American Cataloging Rules (AACR). Much of the adverse criticism which this literature contains is concerned with comparatively unimportant shortcomings of the code. This paper is a discussion of what the author considers to be some of the more serious defects. Several suggestions are made for improving the Code: (1) to avoid ambiguity, the rules in a catalog code must be based on a carefully controlled vocabulary; (2) a code should be based on stated principles; () rules for the selection of main entry headings should be more strictly adhered to; (4) inconsistency in rules determining the structure of main entries must be eliminated; and (5) a catalog code should be as brief as possible. The overall effectiveness of a  code depends to a large extent on the effectiveness of its arrangement. The fact that the scope of some rules is not clear makes it difficult to assess the comprehensiveness of the AACR, but it is probably the most comprehensive code for author/title cataloging in existence.

Participants in the project were the libraries of the University of Chicago, Columbia University, and Stanford University. Two of the more important objectives of the CLSD Project were: 1) to test certain technical assumptions such as the feasibility of developing a mechanism to facilitate cooperative work, and the possibility of developing compatible and transferable automated library systems; and 2) to communicate the findings and experience of the project group to the general library community. Two invitational conferences were organized to report on the CLSD effort, the first at Stanford in 1968, and the second in New York in 1970.  Approximately 100 people from large research libraries involved in automation attended these conferences. At each, the program was divided between papers describing CLSD project efforts and invited papers on topics of general interest. The reaction to both conferences was favorable. This volume contains all of the major papers presented at the New York Conference (Section I), a selection of the papers presented at the Stanford conference (Section II), and a paper describing and summarizing CLSD experience from 1968 through 1970.

        "description":"During the fiscal year covered by this report, the Council allocated $1,401,982 for the support of 32 new projects and continued or completed work on a number of others. In the area of administration and management, the Council is continuing the long-range program designed to help libraries make maximum use of available resources. Since 1968 the Council has been engaged in programs devoted to attracting and keeping young people of high ability in the library profession by providing them with sufficient rewards. Some essential first steps are being taken toward the idealized situation in which all major libraries are linked providing one universal library to serve all readers. The limited funds available to the Council for the support of library automation activities will be given  to only a few of the most promising projects. The Council has been concentrating its efforts in the microform arena on consulting services to libraries and related institutions and on the development of microform catalog applications. The problems of library material preservation has been a concern of the Council since its inception. The Council's concern with college library programs and international library affairs are also discussed. The report is ended with the financial statements. (Author/NH)",

For the purposes of the symposium, a learning center was defined as: (1) having a variety of audio and visual learning paths; (2) containing both print and nonprint resources; (3) affording opportunity for independent learning through audio and visual experiences; and (4) being integrated into the total curriculum. The topics of discussion contained in this volume are: (1) The learning center in the '70's; (2) Is the learning center concept valid for education in the '70's?; (3) What corporate doners expect of education in the '70's; (4) Integrating learning centers into the total school; (5) Evaluating learning center programs; (6) Building  design for learning centers; (7) Preparing materials for learning centers; (8) Equipping learning centers; and (9) Determining cost of learning centers. Included are status reports of existing learning centers at nine colleges, junior colleges and universities. Learning centers with the goal of personalized instruction are seen as an important aspect of education in the future. (Document previously presented in RIE as ED 053 536.) (SJ)",

        "description":"This pair of papers share the focus of determining how differential exposure to information influences attitude formation and change. The first paper deals with the question of how differing amounts of information (set size) affect attitude formation. Set size effects in impression formation have not been obtained when examined in between-subjects design formats. This methodological difference has theoretical implications for interpreting the set size effect. Employing six set sizes, the between-subjects effect was obtained as predicted by both reference scale and information integration interpretations. A second experiment requiring judgement of 28 stimulus persons tested contrary predictions of the two explanations regarding the differences between earlier and later trials in  the series. Supporting the reference scale interpretation, between-subjects set size effects diminished over trials. The second study looks at repetition effects. Repetition was predicted to increase positive reactions when highly similar messages were used. Advertisements were used as the stimulus message. Five similar ads were sequentially presented and attitude was measured by a cognitive response analysis of the thoughts recorded by subjects while attending to the message. In support of the hypothesis, a positive relationship was found between number of presentations and attitude. (Author/SJ)",

        "description":"Management of an information function requires detailed knowledge of what is being spent, how it is spent, and what is received in return for the money. Simply knowing whether a profit has been made or a loss suffered, and even knowing how expenditures were distributed, is not enough information for management. Building block cost analysis is designed to provide the information system manager with precisely the information he needs to manage. This theory is based upon two premises. First, the most effective display of information systems costs is in terms of unit costs. One production count, however, is not a useful measure of an entire information system. The system must be broken down into subunits which can be unit costed, and then added together for the total cost. Second,  unit costs are meaningful only in a framework which includes all costs of the system. The example used to illustrate building block cost analysis is an information activity which collects a series of reports, prepares surrogates, enters them into a computer system, and produces a monthly abstract journal.

Cost considerations made it necessary to conduct the study mainly by telephone using controls to minimize the bias resulting from homes without telephone listings. The questions answered by this survey include: (1) Who uses the library?; (2) Whom does the public think the library is set up to serve?; (3)  What do users think of library services?; (4) Why don't people use the library?; (5) How does the library function relative to children?; (6) Why do people use the library?; and (7) How can potential library users be reached?

The system was originally written in assembler language for a 12K IBM 360 model 20 using a high speed 1403 printer with the UCS-TN chain option (upper and lower case). Input was from an IBM 2560 Multi-function Card Machine. The model 20 version has been superceded by a revised implementation operational on all other models of the IBM System/360. Increased speed is gained by restricting performance to text formatting only, eliminating editing and text scanning functions, such as spelling checking, index generation, etc. This document serves as language specifications and users manual and was completely generated by FMS. It contains an introduction to the system, including  the implementation and project history; a chapter on using FMS; an FMS beginners cookbook, and an explanation of Model 20 tape file management.

There are three major divisions in the system: (1) Command analysis and initialization, (2) Assembler-loader and (3) Interpreter - disassembler. The Command module displays an initial screen describing functions available, current level of development, and supervises the operation of all other components of the system. The Assembler is a subset of Basic  Assembler Language with extended branch mnemonics which accepts standard assembly language and the EQU pseudo operation. The Interpretor module is designed to execute any System/360 instruction except the SVC. Any instruction that could be successfully executed by a program running in problem state is supported.

The course exposes the student to the location skills which are necessary to aid him in becoming a competent user of the media center and its varied resources. Emphasis is on training students to find the information they need. The content of the course is presented in a workshop-type atmosphere in which the student practices library skills in his own program of study. The range of suggested subject matter relates to the material most frequently included in language arts  textbooks on library skills. The degree of specificity lends itself to being taught by a classroom teacher with the school librarian or media specialist serving as a resource person. A list of applicable resources for various grade levels is included. (Author/SJ)",

It highlights measures to correct present shortcomings, which exist because there is no strong linkage between the educational researcher and the practitioner. The paper discusses the nature of an educational system, the reasons why innovations in this field frequently fail, the necessary components of an educational catalyst organization, and the various activities which can be projected for such an organization. It synthesizes findings on change and innovation to posit guidelines for training, for personnel management, and for support  functions within a catalyst organization, and it urges assumption of the catalyst role by the extant Regional Laboratories or some other innovative structure. The paper acknowledges that much research has been done in this general substantive area, but indicates that little specific action has been taken as a result. It thus recommends that such action be taken at this time. (Author)",

Four panel presentations followed by the opportunity for small group discussions of the issues raised during the panel presentations was the format for the conference. The panel topics were: recent advances in the state of computer technology, computer systems for university planning, successful computing systems in  instruction, and successful applications of computer technology to reducing costs and increasing the services of libraries.

What these influences may be and what steps should be taken to assure that the benefits of instructional technology will be realized in an orderly and reasonably prompt manner are the concerns of this report. The utilization of technology for administrative and research tasks in higher learning is acknowledged but the emphasis is on its role in instruction. This report also makes a distinction between instruction that is designed for a formal teaching-learning situation, and the more general information that may result from informal exposure to information and ideas. Thus, this report  is only incidentally concerned with the informal educational potentials of television, while it is very much concerned with the uses of television for instruction. Particular emphasis is given to the direction of new effort that is required if the full advantages of technology in higher education are to be realized. The findings and recommendations are a blend of suggestions and practice which are considered to have the greatest merit as part of a coherent policy. (Author/NH)",

It is noted that comprehensive programs of parent involvement in public education will cut across social-racial-economic lines in the community. Precautions to be remembered by those engaged in school-community endeavors are given: (1) \"Reality\" for the individual is determined by what his reference group accepts as reality; (2) The significance of the informal ties between an individual and his peers also means that even first-hand experience does not automatically create correct knowledge; (3) Programs designed to bring about a change in behavior must lead to the active involvement of individuals in the dialogue concerning the planning and execution of these programs; and (4) This crucial element  of personal involvement is reflected in such areas as voluntary attendance, informality of meetings, and freedom of expression in voicing grievances. It is concluded that to the extent that educators can work with, through, and for new combinations of federal and state government funds, foundation assistance, and local parent groups, they may be able to accomplish something of lasting benefit for modern society through the development of a school system more attuned to the needs of this country.

Further, the frequency theory predicts that the study-test method of list presentation is superior to the anticipation method. College students, performing under silent and spoken rehearsal conditions, learned 16 low-frequency word-pairs with the anticipation or the study-test method. It was found that spoken rehearsal was superior to silent rehearsal, and that method of presentation was not significant. However, in the spoken rehearsal conditions, a trend toward the predicted differences between the two presentation methods was observed. It was suggested that these findings indicate that spoken rehearsal insures the rehearsal of the correct response, and that silent  rehearsers probably do not silently pronounce the correct response to themselves. Implications for the role of spoken rehearsal in verbal discrimination learning were discussed. (For related document, see PS 005 425.) (Author)",

Consistent with previous findings, subjects instructed to overtly verbalize were superior to control subjects on a transfer task requiring no overt verbalization. No significant differences, however, were observed between overt and covert verbalizers. This finding was interpreted to indicate that, in adults, covert verbalization can be as effective in mediating problem solving  behavior as talking aloud.

The other program, the Traditional program, aims to advance the personal, social, motor, and general language development of the children. Data were collected on 60 four-year-old children who were assigned to one of four classes, of 15 each, on a stratified basis such that the sex, race, IQ, and ages of the children in the classrooms were comparable. Results include: (1)  Initially, the Karnes program more effectively promoted cognitive development than the Traditional program; (2) After three years, the differential program effects of the two programs were no longer statistically evident; and (3) the Cognitive functioning of the children at the end of a five-year period was significantly above their initial level. It is concluded that the Karnes Program significantly enhances the functioning of children in the cognitive, social, and probably affective areas. It is recommended that serious consideration be given to the further study and implementation of structured programs. (Author/CK)",

Problems listed as occurring in intervention programs include: maternal-child attachment, individual differences among infants, planning problems, and emotional-social development. Types of intervention studied are: the center model (outside-the-home center), the tutorial model (within a home setting), the home-visit model, and the parent-group model (teaching of parents). Role of the caregiver is conceptualized as follows: (1) home visitor - a guest having a position of low power in the home, and (2) teacher - one who aids the child in achieving a sense of competence. The point is made that evaluation of caregiving programs for low-income children  is difficult and often confounded by complex motivational factors, such as a mother's attitudes toward intervention. The importance of dissemination of infant programs is stressed. (CK)",

The point is made that child marriages have not been exclusive to primitive peoples; they have occurred also in Europe and India, for example. With respect to change, it is noted that we are currently in a process of geometrical and constant change. It is pointed out that an attempt should be made to answer the questions of what we should want for young parents and their children and how we should facilitate their efforts to define and achieve what they want. The following views were expressed by high school students  on the subject of change: (1) Change itself is a value; and (2) Most parents don't recognize change and they resist it. Plus and minus elements of the extended family are discussed. Other aspects of the three principal subjects which are covered in this paper include: psychological independence, economic independence, early separation between parents and their adolescent children, early marriages, and day care.

It is stated that the exclusion of ethnic minority values from the academic scene is the cause for the school system's failure to educate ethnic minority children. The second paper, \"The Implications of Cognitive Styles and Cultural Democracy for Evaluation Research,\" by Manuel Ramirez, states that cultures and values of minority groups in the United States, especially those of Black and  Indians, have been viewed as pathological and inferior. It is also stated that the result of ignoring these cultures is the alienation of minority group children from the schools. (CK)",

        "description":"A study to compare the effects of reading achievement of informal and formal British infant schools is discussed. The informal school, for children from 5-8 years old, utilizes one or more of the following: integrated day, family or vertical grouping, open planning, and team teaching. The formal schools follow a prescribed curriculum and group children homogeneously. The teacher is the directive influence, and there is little integration of curriculum areas. It was hypothesized that on a theoretical basis children who were in a warm, comfortable setting, learning at their own rates, would have an advantage in learning. Three samples were tested: 187 inner-London children, 13 pairs of siblings in a suburban London school, and 47 children in a suburban junior school. In all three  analyses, reading achievement was measured by the Holborn Reading Analysis test. Analysis of the data by means of t-tests showed that there were higher means for children in the informal schools, but a significant difference was found only in the case of the inner-London schools. It was concluded that a commitment to an informal philosophy will not adversely affect reading achievement. (Author/CK)",

This test was developed to supplement the standardized instruments in use to measure program performance. It consists of two principal subtests, an introductory interview, and a section measuring logical reasoning and reading skill achievement. It is noted that the APT measures only cognitive program objectives of a curriculum specific nature and concentrates primarily on those which are amenable to multiple choice or sentence completion format. Application of the APT administered during the third year of the Program's development indicate significant treatment effects for the groups viewing the television program and visited by a paraprofessional. The mobile van used appeared to have an effect on  the child's ability to establish rapport with the tester and seemed to increase the involvement of older boys in the program. An analysis of the data from the third year's evaluation reinforces conclusions reached in evaluations of the two previous years--that is, the television program provides the &quot;raw material&quot; for the curriculum, while the home visitor effectively reinforces the program's cognitive objectives.

The point is made that one of the difficulties associated with evaluating language development is the loose fit between available theoretical and operational definitions of language. Often language is not theoretically defined at all and must be operationally defined by the particular evaluation instrument being used. Consequently, the theoretical model underlying the ITPA is considered to be applicable to the Appalachia program. The ITPA was a primary instrument in gathering data for the development of the preschool curriculum objectives. The text of this report gives an overview of the instrument as well as  separate descriptions for each subtest. Also, statistical descriptions and inferences are presented for each subtest. Three of the 10 subtests administered showed significant treatment of effects after covariance, indicating that there was some correspondence between program and test objectives. Findings indicate that a primary area of program effect is that of expressive language. (Author/CK)",

The results of the factor analysis showed that the tests used in the evaluation of the program were measuring four principal factors; these were visual identification, psychomotor ability, vocabulary, and auditory recall. All of the factors except auditory recall incorporated five or more variables; auditory recall received a loading from only one variable. Analysis  of variance showed that children who received all components of the Preschool Education Program and the children who received two components scored significantly higher than children in the other two groups. Also, the absence of significant differences between scores of children in the various groups on measures related to visual identification and auditory recall suggests that the Preschool Education Program fails to differentially affect the performance of children in those areas.

A standardized situation in which children would have an opportunity to demonstrate those skills was devised. Three treatment groups were included in the program. Sex of the child was used as a factor. One purpose of this study was to determine whether differences in social skills development existed among three groups of children ages 3 to 5 who were in the program. The observational system consisted of 27 categories of social skills. These fall under six major classification--initiation, question or request for help, giving help, refusing help, group consciousness, and response to peer. It was found that the groups receiving two and three components of the  program had more positive verbal responses than the group receiving only one and that the 3- and 4-year-olds explored the situation around them significantly more than the 5-year-olds. Responding constructively was significantly more characteristic of the 4-year-olds. There were three important outcomes of this study: (1) It was shown that a task can be created for preschool children which will elicit from them, in a natural and spontaneous manner, important social skills behaviors; (2) In order to develop social skills in preschool children, it is necessary to provide socialization opportunities through contacts with others outside the home; and (3) Social skills in preschool children can be recorded under a systematic observation plan, are measurable, and can be analyzed statistically.

The Appalachia Educational Laboratory's Preschool Education Program sought to stimulate curiosity in its 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old subjects. One third of the children received only a daily television program. Another third saw the television program and were visited in the homes each week by a paraprofessional. The remaining third saw the television program, received the weekly visit, and attended an hour and a half session in a mobile classroom when it visited their area once a week. Testing involved bringing the children to the field office for a videotaped session. After completing the testing, the children were  sent to a room and play for a period of 15 minutes. The degree of curiosity was operationally defined as the proportion of the total time spent experimenting with the unfamiliar object. The device used to stimulate the children's curiosity was a brightly colored box. It was found that boys appeared more interested in the device than girls, based on their interaction with it. It is concluded that girls at this age have the ability to manipulate these objects but are no longer at a developmental stage in which they are as interested in such activities as boys.

The group which received all components of AEL's Preschool Education Program achieved higher scores than a control group on all three parts of the test designed to measure achievement of cognitive objectives. The kindergarten group also achieved higher scores on one part of the test of cognitive objectives. The girls in all treatment groups outscored the boys on most tests. AEL's program was shown to reach the objectives  measured by two subtests where other programs including the standard kindergarten program did not.

        "description":"An examination of the written evidence of the effects of preschool programs on disadvantaged children and their families is presented. Hundreds of studies were reviewed to determine what kind of justification they provide for continued support of federal, state, and other publicly financed preschool programs. The Head Start and ESEA programs have been reaching about 530,000 children of low-income families or neighborhoods yearly. Two major state-supported programs in California and New York together involve about 30,000 children beyond those in Head Start and ESEA Programs. Findings include: (1) Public preschool programs have been successful in changing intellectual and social behavior of disadvantaged children in positive directions over the short run; (2) Uncertainty about  effects on children's social and emotional development stems not only from the paucity of reliable measurement but also from lack of concensus about what constitutes positive change; and (3) Participation of the parents in workshops and meetings at preschool centers has not been shown to make reliable changes in parents' attitudes about themselves and their own situations, but measures almost always indicate positive feelings toward the preschool program and positive changes in attitude toward school. It has been concluded that these preschool programs promote growth and development in disadvantaged children and that such programs might be justified as models for research and reform. (Author/CK)",

The objectives of this program is to promote the intellectual and social and cultural growth of preschool and kindergarten children. Specific goals include: symbolic representation, problem solving and reasoning, and familiarity with the physical and social environment. The target population consists of all children, three to five years old, with the disadvantaged child given primary concern. Materials used in the program included: (1) letters, numbers, and geometric forms, (2) problem solving and reasoning, including recognition of parts of the body, visual discrimination among objects or pictures, and understanding of relational concepts such as size, shape, position and distance; and (3) natural environment,  including city and country, objects and people, family and home, rules of behavior and fair play. The program was evaluated and the results include the following: (1) The impact in most goal areas was both educationally and statistically significant; (2) Generally, younger children gained more than older children; (3) High viewers benefitted more than low viewers; and (4) High-viewing Spanish-speaking children from a disadvantaged community and with low pretest scores gained more than any other group.

        "author":["Laird, David B., Jr."],
        "description":"Included in this essay is a historical review of Federal policy and practice in Indian education from 1500 to 1970. The earliest period, the missionary period, is representative of the religious zeal of the 16th and 17th centuries wherein the missionaries had as their responsibility the education of the Indian--including the dual effort of civilizing and Christianizing. The next period, from 1794 to 1871, is known as the treaty period wherein the fundamental policy was to dispossess the Indian from his land to allow for White expansion; there is agreement that, during this period, Federal educational policy was a function of the land policy since the goals of education were to convince the Indian to give up the land and move to a farm-based economy. The third period, from 1865 to  1870, found the solution to education in assimilation, and the educational efforts were directed to this end. In 1871, the treaty period was ended by Federal legislation, and the military-type boarding school was developed to provide training for the Indian's emergence into the White culture. The next period, from 1933 to 1945, brought changes in Indian education such as giving the Indians a larger role in the education of their children and providing day schools for two-thirds of the children. From 1945 to present, numerous bills passed by Congress have both hindered and helped Indian education; however, the termination policy has caused the Indians to remain static because of their suspicion of the Government's intent, thus making it difficult for legislation such as the Economic  Opportunity Act to have the hoped-for impact.

        "author":["Tyler, S. Lyman"],
        "description":"It was the purpose of this 1958 paper to demonstrate to the Commission on the Rights, Liberties, and Responsibilities of the American Indian how Indian tribes were first dealt with as sovereign nations and how this concept has changed through time (particularly from 1948 to 1958). When the sovereign-nations or treaty period came to a close, the Indian people were moved under the domination of Congress and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and became wards of the U.S. Government. Next came a period when the Indians were compelled through the Allotment Act and educational influences to move toward complete acculturation and full citizenship, with those Indian people who remained on reservations being encouraged to adopt constitutions and to incorporate under charters as local  communities that could bargain with business concerns, counties, states, and the Federal Government. The successes of the tribal groups led to termination of Federal responsibilities for those tribes because acculturation was assumed; however, the terminated tribes met with failure due to lack of resources. The result was fear by other Indian tribes that success meant termination. Thus, as long as the Termination Resolution remains on the books, it is felt that it will be difficult for Indian people to take full advantage of Federal programs. The paper contains 4 sections: The Historical Setting, The Recent Background to Termination Legislation, Canadian Enfranchisement Compared to Termination, and Identifying Kinds of Federal Withdrawal.

        "description":"An experimental task with accompanying apparatus was developed for use in the study of developmental and cultural differences in the cooperative-competitive behavior of children in a small Mexican town and in California. Two groups of 20 Mexican children (aged 7-8 and 10-11), from an elementary school in a town in Baja, California, Mexico, were used; the Anglo American sample included 3 groups of 24 children (aged 4-5, 7-8, and 10-11) from day-care centers in Los Angeles. The children were tested using a 2-person cooperation-competition marble-pull game designed for the study. A pair of children of the same sex and culture was seated, 1 child at each end of the game table; the children then played for a marble placed in a holder. In the \"tug-of-war situation,\" cooperative  behavior resulted in 1 child getting a marble while competitive behavior resulted in neither child getting a marble. At the conclusion of 10 trials for each pair of children, informal interviews were held to determine, for children who competed maladaptively (competitively), the extent to which they were aware of possible interacting methods. Two instructional trials followed the interview, and subjects completed a second series of 10 trials. Results indicated a higher level of cooperation among Mexican than among Anglo American children and an increase in nonadaptive competition with age among the Anglo American children. (NQ)",

        "description":"Four experiments comparing behavior of children from Los Angeles, California, and Nuevo San Vicente, Baja California, Mexico, were conducted to analyze cooperative and competitive behavior of Anglo American city and Mexican rural children. Eighty children from each setting, 40 of age 7-9 and 40 of age 10-11, equally divided by sex, served as subjects for all 4 experiments. Results of Experiment I, which was designed to assess motivation and ability of children to cooperate in a problem situation with no obvious conflict of interest cues, failed to support the hypothesis of a cultural difference in motivation and ability to cooperate. In Experiment II, which assessed the degree to which children are competitive and rivalrous in a situation without direct social interaction and the  necessity of mutual assistance, both groups appeared highly motivated to take a toy away from a peer when they could keep it. Anglo children, however, were more highly motivated than Mexican children to lower another child's outcomes, even when it meant no gain to themselves. In Experiment III, which examined rivalrous behavior in the presence of direct social interaction, Anglo more than Mexican children responded with conflict to a peer's rivalrous intents in an interpersonal interaction situation; Mexican children were more submissive. In Experiment IV, which measured tendencies to engage in and avoid direct interpersonal conflict, Mexican children were more avoidant of conflict than Anglo children. (Author/NQ)",

After all choices were made, the children could trade the marbles for toys. The conditions, designed to systematically vary absolute and relative outcomes, were presented to Anglo American and Mexican children of ages 5-6 and 8-10 from 2 settings: Los Angeles, California, and Nuevo San Vicente, Baja California, Mexico. Forty-eight children from each culture, 6 boy pairs and 6 girl pairs, participated as subjects. It was revealed that older children were  significantly more rivalrous than younger children; Anglo children were significantly more rivalrous than Mexican children; and the cultural differences tended to increase with age. The effect of conditions was significant, indicating that for all groups rivalry was greatest when accompanied by both relative and absolute gains. The opportunity to avoid a small relative loss increased rivalry more than opportunity to accrue a small absolute gain. The development with age of greater rivalry in boys than girls was present for the Anglo but not Mexican children. (Author/NQ)",

This urbanized rural population continues to grow, despite annexation and consolidation by urban communities, and the wide disparity that once existed between urban and rural populations has all but disappeared. However, the persistent growth of the urbanized rural areas with populations oriented to urban life implies the need for more intensive and innovative social planning efforts. Future planning programs must be concerned with such goals as maintaining some equitable balance between agricultural and nonagricultural activities and between man and his environment if problems associated  with population growth and density are to be avoided.

The primary purposes of this study were (1) to determine the types of legal problems confronting the rural poor person, (2) to ascertain whether he perceived those problems as &quot;legal,&quot; (3) to discover the methods and institutional sources employed in solving these problems, (4) to assess the effectiveness of sources utilized, (5) to identify the factors operative in increasing legal perception and problem-solving ability, and (6) to suggest direction for resolution of the particular problems revealed by the study. The survey was conducted on 2 levels: the first consisting of a questionnaire administered to a sample group of  residents and the second consisting of unstructured interviews with the &quot;community leadership&quot; group.

        "description":"As the church seeks to respond to the human needs arising in our ever-changing society, it must constantly reassess its role in nonmetropolitan areas. At this critical juncture in the history of our country, the nature of the church's mission in town and country is a subject of great debate. For both urban and rural America, this CARA (Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate) study advises that the church's role in an era of change requires both theological and ethical analysis of the sociological facts so that the church can make an adequate response to the dilemmas of our communities. While the scope of this response will differ in the urban and nonmetropolitan areas, its nature is the same. This includes sustaining the community; helping the diocese or the parish to  interpret its responses and catalyze this response; and, through its preaching and sacramental ministry, uniting all men with God and with one another more effectively. It is within this perspective that the 8 articles in this book are presented. The articles result from 2 projects: the Office of Pastoral Studies at St. John's School of Divinity, Collegeville, Minnesota, and the Micro-City Project. Intended as an introduction to the small community today and its projected future, these lectures provide an understanding of the change affecting small communities as well as ideas that might help the individual face the realities of change so that he can evaluate and plan in a spirit of hope rather than defeat.

The empirical research for this project consisted of 3 phases: (1) determination (by questionnaire) of attitudes of rural Colorado attorneys toward the legal problems of the indigenous poor; (2) the use of unstructured interviews with local community leaders in the 2 counties to collect general information regarding the legal problems of local indigents, the extent to which they seek the assistance of nonattorney community leaders, and the effectiveness of these leaders in performing their self-designated tasks as &quot;confidants&quot; to the poor; and (3) the use of informal interviews with the rural poor to determine their experiences in recognizing and  confronting problems having legal implications and their actual contact with an attorney. The report of this project contains a description of the demography and social background of the conflict that results when these systems fail. Major conclusions reported are that the formal legal structure is largely alien to the poverty class of the 2 counties; that there is a need for free legal services for the rural poor; and that the informal system can be a viable adjunct to effective legal aid in the area.

The most successful aspect of the project was the identification on the part of the Navajos of what they wanted included in the Navajo Culture Curriculum at Navajo Community College. This document contains these materials, which were developed for use mainly at the adult level. Due to the interest of the compilers, the majority of materials relate to the area of study labeled &quot;The Origin of the Navajo.&quot; That portion of Navajo Culture is, in effect, the Navajo Bible. It should not be thought, however, that all of the medicine men or members of the Advisory  Board agreed as to the content or the subject matter included since, in the oral traditions, there is no universally accepted, correct version. Thus, &quot;The Origin of the Navajo&quot; reflects a number of the stories that the Navajos respect, but there are equally valid variations even to these stories. The second group of curriculum materials is entitled &quot;The Growth of the Navajo--Up to 1960.&quot; Materials included in this section relate to events such as the Long Walk and Stock Reduction. The last group of curriculum materials is &quot;The Navajo Today and Tomorrow, 1960-into the future.&quot; Materials collected under this heading come largely from current tribal officials and reflect their emphasis as to those areas which should receive attention.

Selected Federal programs (242 programs comprising 74.4% of all Federal outlays) were divided into 4 program categories: human resource development; community development; agriculture and natural resources, and Defense, the National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA), and the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). The counties affected by these programs were divided into 6 categories on the basis of population density and the percentage of urban population. Major conclusions of this initial study were that (1) nonmetropolitan residents do not share proportionately in the distribution of outlays of many Federal programs; (2) Federal outlays for Defense, NASA, and AEC  far overshadow outlays for the other program categories and heavily favor the larger, higher income urban areas; (3) programs narrow in scope and limited in objective are failing to meet this country's development needs effectively; and (4) Federal outlays for agriculture and natural resources tend to be concentrated in nonmetropolitan counties with pronounced population declines but comparatively high per-capita incomes.

It is noted that population growth in the 1960's was unevenly distributed within age groups and also unevenly distributed geographically. Some rural-urban differences are also discussed: urbanization of the blacks continued at a rapid rate; rural population declined; and, although migration was an important element in the differential growth rates of states and of areas within the states, in most areas the bulk of the increase was due to the excess of births over deaths. A major conclusion is that continued population  growth, though at a lower rate than in the recent past, is indicated. (PS)",

Data collection began in 1961, when each 3rd-, 6th-, and 9th-grade teacher in Eau Claire County, Wisconsin, was asked to nominate 2 boys and 2 girls whose behavior was persistently aggressive and 2 boys and 2 girls whose behavior was persistently socially acceptable and productive (n=1550). This sample was then used for 3 previous phases of investigation (as reported in ED 014 335, ED 019 153, and ED 020 812) and for the present study, Phase IV. The method of investigation for Phase IV consisted of obtaining test scores and  grades for the original 3rd and 6th graders; obtaining rank in graduating class for the original 6th and 9th graders; completion of The Behavior Problems Checklist for 12th graders; completion of social adjustment ratings by teachers on 8 aspects of behavior for 12th graders and the graduates; and collection of data from police and sheriff departments, welfare agencies, the juvenile court, a mental health agency, and the health department. From these data, variables were isolated for use in predicting academic achievement, social adjustment, health and welfare, and law contact. In the report, statistical analyses in terms of these variables are presented in tabular form, and manuals are provided for use in predicting behavior in terms of the variables that were isolated.

        "description":"In this U.S. Commission on Civil Rights report, denial of equal opportunity to Mexican Americans by exclusionary practices in public schools is examined through information gathered at a Commission on Civil Rights hearing and a subsequent 1969 survey of school districts in Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas having enrollments of more than 10% Spanish-surnamed students. Although some innovations oriented to closing the educational gap between Anglos and Mexican Americans were found, school systems generally had not recognized the culture and tradition of the Mexican American and had not adopted policies and programs enabling Mexican American students to participate fully in the benefits of the educational process. Of 3 types of programs that schools may use to  meet the English language difficulty of Spanish-speaking students (bilingual education, English as a second language, and remedial reading), bilingual education was observed to be potentially the most advantageous to both Anglo and non-English-speaking students; however, bilingual programs were found in only 6.5% of the schools--possibly because of the great curricular change required. Suppression of the Spanish language was found to be the most overt area of cultural exclusion, followed by exclusion of relevant course content in terms of Indo-Hispanic history, heritage, and folklore. Exclusion of Mexican American community involvement was also noted: few school districts availed themselves of community advisory boards, contacts with the community, community relations specialists, and/or  Mexican American educational consultants. Related documents are ED 052 849 and ED 056 821. (MJB)",

For the segment of the study described in this volume, a projective-type test was developed and administered in parents' homes by interviewers who were selected (by recommendations obtained through local chapter houses) as being respected and skilled in bilingual communication. The transcripts resulting from parents' responses to the 3 pictures and 5 questions of the projective test were then analyzed, and 10 &quot;ideal&quot; values common to all parents were identified by means of a count on themes (key words)  running through the transcripts. Significant differences between types of parents in the sample were then identified as a function of racial affiliation, and 10 &quot;behavioral&quot; values were identified for the Indian parent and 10 for the non-Indian parents. It was concluded that Indian parents have a strong desire for (1) quality education for their children, (2) a strong economic base, (3) vocational programs, (4) bilingual programs, and (5) local control of schools.

The 1964 study revealed, for example, that 10th grade was by far the dominant dropout grade for males; the 1972 study, although maintaining a high 10th-grade dropout rate, showed a more even distribution of dropouts throughout the high school years. Female dropout patterns were similar in both studies, with high dropout percentages in the 10th and 11th grades. Age 17 emerged as the dominant dropout age in the 1972 study, as compared with the previous dominant dropout age of 16 years. In the 1972 study, decreases  were noted in 6th and 7th grade dropouts, in the male-to-female dropout ratio, in overall dropout percentage rates, and in students leaving school for a single reason. Marriage, low scholastic ability, and dissatisfaction with school were the predominant single reasons for dropping out.

The 1st set of books, the &quot;Read Aloud Stories,&quot; contains 10 illustrated books intended to be read to preschool and early elementary students who are not proficient readers. Each story, of Sioux origin, conveys a simple concept to the child concerning his Indian heritage. Reading grade levels as determined by the Spache Readability Formula are grades 1.9 to 3.4, although the books have been read aloud or used as readers through 6th grade. Although evaluation of these books has been limited (they have been used in 7 schools), reports by teachers using the books have been  favorable. The 2nd set of books, the &quot;Rebus Reading Book Series,&quot; contains 10 illustrated books intended for use as supplementary readers in grades 1.779 through 2.2488 (Spache Formula). In these books, adaptations of Indian folk tales introduce readers to Indian cultural history. Interview-questionnaire technique showed the use of rebuses to reduce vocabulary load and allow for anticipation of unknown structure words. No statistical analysis was used due to the limited number of subjects. Included in this 3-part report on preparation of these materials are preliminary project information, overviews of the 2 sets of books in terms of preparation and final product, evaluations of the 2 series, tables of readability analysis (by book), appendices showing resource materials and the  questionnaire, and bibliographies of materials used in book preparation.

All groups contained white, black, and Puerto Rican boys and girls, but sex and race were not factors in group establishment. Class sizes ranged from 22 to 28 students, and experimental students were transferred whenever reading levels changed. Materials were specially chosen to meet experimental class needs. Oral and silent reading, charts of progress, programmed materials, and skill developmental  exercises were used in experimental classes. Pretests and posttests administered in September and June were analyzed using t-tests. All comparisons demonstrated significantly better gains in reading (p .01) for the experimental groups.

Boys committed to a St. Paul, Minnesota, boys' residential treatment center over a 5-year period from 1966 to 1971 were used as subjects. Interviews; intelligence, reading, arithmetic, and spelling tests; and personality inventories administered at the time of referral to the center provided data for analysis. The results indicated that reading grade levels of delinquents remained stable over the 5-year period and showed consistent retardation. Little change in the relationship between retardation and  delinquency could be found since 1915.

Two types of reading models under information processing are analyzed: the O-type model which delineates the organismic systems operating between input and output at a psychological level, and the S-type model which concerns the transformations of the information itself from the printed pattern into meaningful language of a form appropriate to the intended output. These models are conceived of as contributing not directly to reading instruction, but to serve as a seminal focus for further research in a variety of disciplines. Some of these processes unfamiliar to reading teachers should add genuinely new  dimensions to the teaching of reading, since they provide a more precise basis for diagnosis and remediation and could serve a taxonomic function for the structuring of individualized reading programs.

The groups read or listened to a fictional story in either the traditional prose or the telegraphic form and then answered 20 questions on the passage. Four dependent variables were analyzed: total number correct on the test, reading rate, reading time, and  S-scores (number of nested items correct minus the number of disjunctive items correct). It was found in both experiments that the amount of time spent reading the telegraphic versions was less than one-half the time spent reading the traditional passage; but there was approximately 12 percent less comprehension demonstrated by the telegraphic groups versus the traditional groups. No interaction was found between the visual-auditory variable and the traditional-telegraphic variable. (AW)",

Each of these was considered in turn and its relative contribution assessed.

Results of past investigations fail to provide conclusive data due to the lack of consistency in defining disability groups, lack of adequate control groups in studies of intervention techniques, and lack of comparability among measures of educational outcomes (for example oral vs. silent reading tests) used in different studies. Evidence has been found of a small but definite relationship between articulation and other language skills: reading, vocabulary, and other lexical and grammatical errors. Relationships are stronger when oral tests are used to measure the  language function (oral reading, reading readiness). Relationships also tend to be stronger when younger children are used as subjects, partly because oral tests must be used when dealing with very young children.

The first group seeking the skills for effective teaching of reading in a classroom requires continuing guided exposure and opportunities to test their abilities within regular classrooms in order to recognize and understand the interrelatedness of psychological principles, the function of reading in the classroom, and the characteristics of group and individual learning. Given these supervised experiences with many opportunities for discussion on problems encountered, they should be able to function at a level where they use their  acquired knowledge and skills consciously. The second group, influenced greatly by past teaching experience and presenting an even greater spread of capabilities than the undergraduates, requires more careful screening in terms of performance and, frequently, specific placement into undergraduate work prior to admission into graduate study. Programs for admitted students should be individually designed according to their future roles. Graduate study should consist of advanced study--not remediation for inadequacies in undergraduate training. References are included. (Author/AW)",

Half the subjects were tested immediately after reading the passages and half were tested after a seven-day interval. Two trained raters made judgements as to which linguistic subunits would be recalled. An independent group of 48 raters were given details of the experiment and asked to predict which phrase units they would recall had they been subjects in the experiment. The textual passages were ranked  according to their predicted recalls and then divided into four groups ranging from highest to lowest predicted recall.

Thirteen tests of specific skills and abilities were grouped into one battery and administered to 97 elementary school students from various school districts. Test results were correlated and factor analyzed. It was found that one general readiness factor  accounted for nearly one-half the total variance of the tests.

The Florence program was designed to increase the students' self-confidence by providing ways for them to experience success in listening, speaking, reading, and writing. The Gary program agreed that self-confidence building was important but emphasized the cognitive more than the affective domain. The Florence program included an initial administration of reading tests to the students, a screening of teachers to find which ones wanted to teach classes of  disadvantaged students, and a five day inservice workshop for teachers. The workshop outlined objectives, emphasized the importance of teaching students at their own levels, and deemphasized the importance of drill in teaching reading skills.

The deHirsch Predictive Index, on which the Pre-Reading Test was patterned, was also given. The first graders in three experimental and three matched control schools were sampled and compared on reading achievement at the end of the first grade with standardized reading tests. Factor analysis was used to reduce the number  of teacher and classroom variables.

The Wayne County Pre-Reading Test with the Self-Concept and Motivation Inventory (SCAMIN) exceeded the predictability of the deHirsch Predictive Index.

        "description":"Modules of physics instructional materials, each focusing on a particular physical system of interest to technical students, are being developed at four separate centers and coordinated by a Technical Physics Project Steering Committee. A typical module, constituting from one to three weeks of a physics course, will include a statement of behavioral objectives, entry/exit tests and a resource document for the instructor, as well as the instructional program. The latter will describe student investigations related to the system and lead the student to the understanding and skills necessary for him to meet the stated objectives. Although the main focus of each module will be on understanding how its physical system works, the intention is that a selected series of modules should  introduce students to the major ideas and principles of physics central to their future role as technicians. The choice of systems and levels of treatment will be coordinated by the Steering Committee to provide adequate overlapping. Thus, instructors may vary their selection of modules to create courses which match local interests and degrees of sophistication. The project aims to produce forty to fifty modules over a four year period and to evaluate the use of these materials on a national scale. (Author/TS)",

The University of Washington Physics Department has developed a new course in physical science, conducted in an individualized self-paced manner, with laboratory investigation, observation, and manipulation preceding all discussion and motivating the formation of concepts and models. The course begins with selected portions of College Introductory Physical Science (CIPS) and continues with selected portions of The Project Physics Course. The course runs for three quarters, and students must take two quarters to receive credit with the third  quarter optional. No formal lectures are presented; rather, small group discussions are held with students who are at a common place in the course. Students take oral or written examinations as they finish sections of the course and then proceed to the next section. (YS)",

C., October, 1971, Anthony Wayne Smith, President, National Parks and Conservation Association, presents an expose on how rivers should be managed by methods which restores and preserve the natural life balances of the localities and regions through which they flow. The outmoded and destructive objectives of water resources management currently practiced by government agencies and regulated utilities is duscussed in relation to technological advances. The big dam system is attacked, together with the system of water management which it presupposes. This includes such aspects as irrigation, reclamation projects, hydroelectric power, flood control, water supply, pollution abatement, navigation, low-flow  augmentation, and recreation. To prevent pollution, strict regulations which will equalize costs are necessary. Also, a complete reversal of present river basin management policies by public agencies, public utilities, and private business is called for. The concept of full development, expressing modern preoccupation with technology and engineering, must be changed to an approach of ecological management. Management and development which will supply all human needs can and must be provided by methods which are compatible with the preservation of the life environment. (BL)",

Dangers facing wildlife, endangered plant species, and pressures of a rising human population are also considered as part of man's concern, responsibility, and respect for all life. He must recreate his sense of the community of life, of the  interrelationship of all living things. Cooperation between humane and conservation movements for common causes is, therefore, advocated with each lending the other increasing support in the years ahead.

The students were those enrolled in all sections of both the calculus and non-calculus oriented, three quarter sequenced, introductory general physics courses offered at California State Polytechnic College during Winter Quarter, 1971. The results indicated that students felt mathematics was more relevant and more palatable than physics. Physics courses were perceived as relatively low in stimulation, personal usefulness, social value, historical value, and political value. The laboratory experiences were described as not exciting  intellectually, not personally useful, and not supportive of the lectures. Students who had high school physics held decided perceptual advantages over students who had not had high school physics. (Author/TS)",

The major conclusions and recommendations of the meeting may be summarized as follows: (1) Every electrical engineer should understand the capabilities and limitations of computers. He should know how to use computers as an aid in solving complex technical problems; (2) Digital and analog circuits are of major importance in the design of modern systems. Students should have equal familiarity with both classes of circuits; (3) Students should have more design experience. This experience can be  obtained by introducing more project-oriented course and laboratory work into the undergraduate program; (4) Students should obtain more experience with simulation techniques and model making. They should also learn the factors that limit the usefulness of these techniques; and (5) The undergraduate program of a student should provide considerable flexibility and a minimum of required courses. The actual program of study, selected by a student with the help of a faculty advisor, should help provide the background for a lifetime of self-motivated and self-directed study. (Author/TS)",

The group was formed in response to the growing demand for education in computer engineering and the limited opportunities for study in this area. Computer engineering is concerned with the organization, design, and utilization of digital processing systems as general purpose computers or as components of systems concerned with communication, control, measurement, or signal processing. The report is concerned with a new undergraduate option within electrical engineering which is called \"computer engineering\" and considers the need for such a program, a description of its content, and a plan of  implementation. Included are recommended subjects, electives and prerequisites for computer engineering programs. Possible four year computer engineering curricula within electrical engineering are presented as developed by four universities: Carnegia-Mellon, Princeton, The University of Texas at Austin, and University of Hawaii.

        "description":"This report is from Task Force VIII of the COSINE Committee of the Commission on Education of the National Academy of Engineering. The task force was established to formulate subject matter for an elective undergraduate subject on computer operating systems principles for students whose major interest is in the engineering of computer systems and software. The student taking the course should be provided with an intellectual basis adequate for understanding and designing operating systems five and ten years in the future. The universities using this report will vary considerably with respect to course duration, pace at which new concepts can be introduced, and student preparation. For these reasons the material was organized into eight \"modules,\" each dealing with an important  conceptual component of current knowledge. Each module contains these features of the model and its manifestations in specific systems, a topic outline, and a guide to the literature. The modules are: (1) Introduction, (2) Procedure Implementation, (3) Processes, (4) Memory Management, (5) Name Management, (6) Protection, (7) Resource Allocation, and (8) Pragmatic Aspects.

        "description":"The goal of this study was to investigate improvement in the usage of equivalence and order relations under specified instructional conditions. Forty-eight upper middle class kindergarten children were given a 14-session pretreatment designed to define two equivalence and four order relations of length and matching, followed by tests of conservation and transitivity. On the basis of the transitivity test scores, the children were then assigned by matched pairs to two treatments: a Classification Treatment in which an object was considered as representing a collection of like objects, and a Standard Treatment in which no such assumption was made. Posttests of conservation, transitivity, and use of the asymmetric property were then given. Analysis by sign test and contingency  tables showed that both treatments were effective but not significantly different. No evidence was found that acquisition of matching relations preceded acquisition of length relations. Also, possession of transitivity appeared unstable and unrelated to conservation. (MM)",

A group of 129 first and second graders were given a test of conservation and measurement consisting of five problem types crossed with three transformation types. The problems all involved moving liquid from one of two identical containers into a container of a different shape. The dominance of perceptual versus numerical cues was varied by using clear and opaque containers, by measuring out the liquid using equal or unequal units, and by varying the order of the cues. The transformations were those making equal quantities appear unequal; those making unequal quantities appear equal; and those appearing to reverse the direction of  inequality between two quantities. Achievement models were proposed and tested by multivariate analysis of variance. Results indicated that numerical cues were as significant as perceptual cues in most conservation problems; that measurement was meaningful to the majority of the children tested; and that order and equivalence problems were of equal difficulty.

The conference, sponsored by Research for Better Schools, Inc., was concerned with individualization of science instruction, particularly in elementary schools. Thirty-three scientists and science educators from various sections of the country contributed papers or discussion notes about theoretical and practical aspects of science instruction. The aim of the meeting was to exchange information about current attempts to teach science on an individualized basis, and to provide a center for the accumulation and dissemination of such information. The following papers are presented: \"The Case for a Laboratory Approach to Individualized Instruction,\" Celia  Lavatelli; \"Learning Theory Applications to the Problem of Individualized Instruction in Science,\" David Ausubel; \"Comments on the Content of the Science Program,\" Richard Harbeck; \"Scientific Method,\" Michael Scriven; \"Individually Prescribed Instruction in Science: The Oakleaf Project,\" W. Shepler and J. Cohen; \"The Intermediate Science Curriculum Study,\" Ernest Burkman; \"The Computer as an Aid to Individualized Instruction,\" Edward Adams; \"Statement of the Role of Standardized Tests in Science Education,\" Lee Brown; and \"The Application of the Continuous Progress Concept to the Natural Sciences in Higher Education,\" J.

        "description":"This study sought to identify factors that motivate girls to complete a four-year sequence of academic mathematics. Forty variables involving community, family, school and personal factors were measured and analyzed by a MANOVA for correlations with two criterion variables. The first criterion was a classification of schools on the basis of the fraction of its college-bound graduates who successfully completed at least one semester of advanced mathematics in their senior year; no factor was found which was well correlated with this criterion. The second criterion classified the students by whether they were taking advanced mathematics and whether they intended to major in a strongly mathematics-related subject at college. Well correlated with this criterion were a belief that  high school mathematics would be useful in future studies and a preference for natural over social science. Preference for masculine-type tasks did not show a strong relation, and encouragement by relatives, teachers, counselors, or friends was a better predictor than parent's education. As a result of this study, the author recommends more attention to affective factors in the teaching of mathematics. (MM)",

Performance objectives, teaching-learning inquiries, and evaluation-terminal performance are outlined within each level based on three supporting concepts. These concepts emphasize interdependence in interchange of matter and energy, in social interaction, and in cultural components and forms. Basic ideas accentuated throughout the activities are that: (1) increased population growth creates a population pressure on the carrying capacity of our ecosystem, and (2) the consumption of goods and  services per capita places an increased pressure on our renewable and non-renewable resources. Topics cover land, air, water, ecology, plants and animals, environment, and population and the approaches to these topics; concepts stress awareness, concern, and action.

Students of two second-grade classes were randomly reassigned to either group S or group I. Profiles were generated by item sampling. Group means were estimated for addition, subtraction and total performance every three days. Also, on the eighteenth day all children were administered a 20-item achievement test. Overall differences in group performance were not significant. Some differences in performance on operations at  specific times were significant and favored group S. (Author/MM)",

Experimental group teachers were selected on three effectiveness criteria, and pretest, posttest, and retention test measures were therefore analyzed using descriptive statistics. The instruction, which lasted ten days and had as its terminal objective telling time to the nearest minute, was found to produce \"educationally significant\" differences only at the grade one level. No anxiety increases were detected as a result of using the program.

Following the explication of the concept of a system, the scope of system theory and systems engineering is discussed and operationally defined, with characteristic features of the methodology of systems science and engineering investigated. The state-of-the-art in systems science and engineering education is reviewed. The impact of systems science on engineering curricula, interdisciplinary and intradisciplinary study and research programs and on the structure of academic institutions is discussed. A method for identifying what constitutes the core of systems science and engineering programs, based on the factor analysis of catalogue descriptions of  systems science and engineering courses and other relevant data, is proposed. The proposed method is demonstrated and tested on a sample population of such course descriptions, with the model curriculum based on the subject areas in the core being compared with other models of systems science and engineering curricula. The proposed method is also shown as being usable in identifying scope and orientation of academic curricula in general and of systems science and engineering curricula in particular. The feasibility of developing a technique for matching student's background and interests with program orientation is also demonstrated. (Author/PR)",

Study and analysis of democratic ideals and values leads to an understanding that they are not applied equally to minority groups. Past treatment of Indians, and Negroes is examined. Activities that provide opportunities for learning how it feels to be discriminated against are given. Emphasis is upon recognition of the many cultural and political contributions made by the ethnic  groups. Thinking tasks supplied in this unit are on concept formation, interpretation of data, and application of generalizations. Twenty-five learning activities are coordinated with the thinking tasks. Supplementary features include a bibliography of books, filmstrips, films, and maps, and three teacher appendices. (Related documents are: ED 048 035 through ED 048 041.) (Author/SJM)",

        "description":"This paper examines trends in social science and political education since World War II; discusses some of the fundamental directions established by the new social studies curricula; and evaluates the political science component of material produced by the curriculum development projects of the 1960's. Since World War II, the study of government and politics in the U.S. has been profoundly influenced by the behavioral approach. Also, social changes, such as the effects of technological advancement, and the realization of global interdependence, forced a redefinition of the traits and competencies desirable for citizens. In response to these pressures, a number of curriculum development projects were established. Out of the totality of social science curriculum packages developed  during the 1960's, 46 have been identified as including some inputs from political science. The author classifies and discusses materials in four categories: those having 1) interdisciplinary use of the social sciences; 2) a focus on a particular discipline; 3) a focus on political science; and, 4) a focus on a particular geographic area. She then analyzes and evaluates these materials in terms of the cognitive and affective goals set out by the Political Science Advisory Panel to the California Statewide Social Science Committee.

The conference was designed to assist extension workers by broadening their perspective, understanding, and handling of the methodology of public affairs education. Four topics in the field of extension education were studied. In Part I, \"The University's Role in Public Policy Education\", a strategy is offered which would enable the university to serve more fully the need of citizens for knowledge toward public decision making. Part II, \"Policy Issues for the Seventies\", points out that many decisions in agriculture today are being made by non-farm people, and suggests ways of broadening the base of public support  for agricultural programs, issues, and people. Part III, \"Income Maintenance Programs\", examines goals, objectives, criteria, types, and rural impacts of income maintenance programs. In Part IV, \"Environment and the Quality of Life\", the relationship between agricultural and non-agricultural uses of rural environment is discussed, including problems of pollution which create a need for policies in the rural environment, and problems of population and the relationship of the quality of life to these topics. Institutional alternatives for improving our environment are explained. (Author/SJM)",

        "description":"This paper draws upon interviews with several eminent behavioral scientists who are well acquainted with the American educational scene in order to: 1) glean the latest, freshest ideas from behavioral science; and, 2) to focus the paper sharply upon alienation as seen in its relationship to the schools. First, the origins of the concept of alienation and its contemporary meaning are examined. Varying perspectives on alienation, and its relationship to the generation gap, are offered by Dr. Keith Davis, Dr. Edward Joseph Shoben, and Dr. Gilbert Wrenn. The major part of the paper is devoted to the challenge for the school and approaches for the social studies teacher. Ways to make schools less rigid and impersonal are suggested. Among several ideas for social studies teachers,  Wrenn recommends careful attention to group process and group tolerance of deviant ideas. Davis sees moral development as being the desired focus for much of social studies, and would utilize small discussion groups for probing moral dilemmas. Developing student discussion out of cognitive conflict derived from moral dilemmas finds application in numerous conceptual areas. Finally, content of the social studies curriculum can hardly be perceived as relevant by youth unless it provides for consideration of what Hunt and Metcalf have described as closed areas.

An inquiry teaching strategy encouraging children to find out things for themselves is presented. Children are asked to make guesses or set up hypotheses regarding regional situations by drawing upon previously-learned concepts and generalizations. The main theme of the course is that man uses his physical environment in terms of his cultural perceptions, values, and level of technology. The unit centers on selected sequent occupance case studies showing how man has dealt with his environment over time. The pupils focus upon a few case studies rather than a detailed study of  each region. This course includes three main units, arranged geographically, that present an overview of the patterns of the country and a system of regionalization for the United States, Canada, and Latin America. The main part of each resource unit is set up in a double-page format to help teachers see the relationships among objectives, content, teaching procedures, and materials of instruction.

        "description":"This paper traces the development of Chinese students educated in America from 1868 to 1969 and discusses the impact that education had on returning students and the influence that these students exerted on the economic, political, and cultural institutions of China. Before 1949, more Chinese studied in the United States than in Europe or the Soviet Union. Participation of American-trained students in the two revolutions of modern China, however, was far less than that of students educated in and returned from Japan, who carried out the revolution of 1911, or students returned from the Soviet Union, who carried out the revolution of 1949. Participation of American trained students was low because the American system was incompatible with Chinese institutions, and they attempted  to revitalize China's declining society by adapting to Westernization. Furthermore, many students sent abroad remained in America where they could not influence change in China or were alienated from the peasant masses. American-trained students made significant contributions by: 1) injecting science and technology into China's culture; 2) introducing the American mass educational system that replaced the old Chinese examination institution; and, 3) maintaining a continuous supply of trained students as the nucleus of China's scientific and engineering man-power.

There is, however, a sequencing of skills, with study skills taking first priority and inquiry skills being taught only to those who have reached a prescribed level of competence in other skills areas. Each topical lesson plan is set out in terms of understandings, teacher objectives, behavioral objectives, references, subject matter and method of teaching it. The study  skills section incorporates a variety of components--note taking, skimming, summarizing, locating information, and library skills. In the section dealing with valuing skills, the authors propose a method to analyze positions on value issues and techniques that encourage students to take a stand on controversial problems. The section on critical thinking focuses on a variety of skills and stresses propaganda analysis. The material in the Inquiry Skills section deals with conducting polls, the use of sampling, interviewing, and the analysis of data. (Author/JLB)",

The goal was to help students begin to adopt the perspectives, tools, and research skills of the social scientist. The school has a student body of 2400; more than half the students are members of minority groups. Early class meetings were used to introduce the psychologist as a resource person, and to focus on possible project topics. Suggestions for topics centered around drugs, racism, police, and suicide. Over a two-year period, two project groups in two different classes were able to organize, design, and conduct their own investigations. Both studies were of a survey nature. The more  complete project, which dealt with racism, is described in detail. As a sophisticated, controlled study, this student project left much to be desired. However, students who had never before shown the interest or ability were able to complete an investigation of their own design, and demonstrated some understanding of important elements of the scientific method in the process.

Some aspects of the broader setting for this training are briefly sketched, such as: a) the formal actions taken by the various United Nations agencies indicating the programs and services available in population and family planning; and, b) ways in which Unesco's role in educational systems in population/family planning differs from Unesco's work in other areas. A number of problems need to be considered: 1) definition and delineation of population education; 2) problems of curriculum development; 3) instructional materials and aids; 4) teacher  education; 5) training of leadership personnel; and, 6) evaluation. In considering possible answers to these problem areas, the meeting may be in a position to provide guidance not only on specific matters such as objectives, content and scope of the proposed training courses, but also on the wider overall program of action into which the course should fit.

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to discuss the alleged special difficulties in teaching very young children how to interpret cartographic symbols. Adults too often reduce or temporarily destroy interest by introducing too many complications too fast. There is a vast difference between acceptance of a fact and understanding of the cause of the fact. In teaching children how to understand maps, teachers often seek to deal with the difficult aspects first, such as the representation of a curved surface on a plane surface, and they seek to press from simple facts to complicated explanations at too fast a pace. Understanding symbols involves simply the ability to associate ideas, a process commenced shortly after birth. Many teachers assume that it is essential to provide pictorial maps  if young children are to understand cartographic symbolism. But to use facsimile representations first only prolongs the process. As to the problems connected with the round world and flat maps, the important thing is to convince the child that it works, and how. It is suggested that nine years be accepted as the minimum age at which instruction in contouring be usefully commenced. The most important thing in teaching cartographic symbolism is that children must be brought to understand at each stage of instruction why something is being done in a certain way, and the object of doing it.

The Library of Congress, through its Photoduplication Service, performed the microfilming service and in 1953 issued a guide entitled Negro Newspapers on Microfilm: A Selected List. The present document is intended to fill the gaps and omissions in that Library of Congress guide. The results of a title-by-title search of the 180 reels of microfilm have been compiled into three lists. List I is arranged alphabetically by the title of each newspaper on the film. At the beginning of certain entries, symbols are used to indicate that the title cannot be found in Brown's Check List, Ayer's  Newspaper Directory, Gregory's, and Union List of Serials. If dates of publication can be verified in one of these sources, they are included in the title line of the entry. The reel and title number on the last line of each entry expresses the exact location on the microfilm. List II is arranged by state and city of publication. List III is arranged by reel and title order indicating the order in which the titles appear on each reel of the set. (Author/JLB)",

Selections indicate the diversity in philosophies, techniques, materials, and racial composition of classes. Course descriptions provide an explanation of establishment of the course, general aims, general course content, texts, methods, evaluation, and recommendations. Part II  presents two statements on black literature; one, \"The Black Picaresque in Fiction\" by Dr. Charles H. Nichols, contains autobiographical writings on black experience that reveal deep conflicts which, when translated into fiction, assume the form of the picaresque. The other, \"Negritude\" by W. A.

Data were collected on 147 male U. S. Navy sailors 18-21 years old by means of a behavior oriented questionnaire containing approximately 330 items about the respondents' homes and family practices. The findings indicated that there are a number of &quot;universal&quot; practices regarding use of the home environment and that clusters of environmentally related behaviors distinguish two &quot;ecological styles&quot;, in terms of  behaviors exhibited throughout the home: Type A (open/informal/socially interactive characteristics that are reflected in all family members); and Type B (who exhibit the opposite characteristics and set up firmer boundaries). Directions for further research are: 1) examine antecedent factors associated with the use of family environments; 2) compare patterns of the use of environments; and, 3) compare social, ethnic, and cultural groups.

Essentially the paper offers an interconnected set of propositions dealing with environmental pressures on the autonomy of college/university faculties coupled with a discussion of the coping strategies that faculties make when threatened. Some of the propositions are: 1) the greater the external control over resources, the lower the professional autonomy; 2) the lower the professionals' control over client characteristics, the lower the professional autonomy; and, 3) the more the school and its significant environment tend to be in harmony, the greater the professional autonomy of the faculty, and vice versa.  The author proposes that much can be learned about the autonomy and organization of the academic profession by examining the relation of professionals to their environment, instead of focusing on the internal nature of the profession itself or on the academic institution. If this is correct, much of the variation in the internal operation and structure of colleges/universities ought to be predictable from a knowledge of their relations with their outside environment.

        "description":"This paper examines the nature of radicalism, proposes definitions and dimensions, and suggests the dynamics of radical thoughts and their interrelation with schools. A radical idea is one which is highly divergent from the normative values, behaviors, ideals or traditions of a culture at a point in time. This paper views radical ideas as occurring at either end of a right-left spectrum of social thought. While one might expect radical right and radical left ideas to be dichotomous, there are a number of areas of convergence. Because schools are a major agent of socialization, they are one of the primary foci of reform movements, both as agents and targets. Thus, the content of radical social ideas has a direct relation to the content present in schools. In terms of process,  schools in an open society must be able to provide an intellectual setting in which conflicting ideas can be examined. This process implication of radical ideas for education assumes adequate academic freedom and intellectual prowess to engage students in these typically controversial topics. Unfortunately, the tradition of intellectual and academic freedom has not been well established in the public schools. Educators need to undertake the study of social radicalism and to provide students with opportunities for extensive investigation of radical social ideas. (Author/JLB)",

Designed to cover the whole panorama of history (1450 through 1969) in sequence, the course aims to help students understand early events and how they are related to contemporary affairs. The multi-concept plan is based upon the assumption that the subject matter of American history can be presented in terms of general organizing concepts. These general ideas (primary concepts) serve as the organizational framework for factual content (secondary concepts) of the course. The students, taught by this plan, become aware of the relativity of historical interpretation and learn to organize facts  into meaningful patterns. The thirty-six week course in American history is divided into 17 units of instruction, with each unit varying from one to three weeks in duration. The last three units are devoted to the developing twentieth-century conflict between Capitalism and Communism. Concepts, content, guides, oral and written activities, and bibliography of student and teacher materials are presented for each unit. A social studies skills development chart is appended.

These goals influenced the decisions on cataloging format for bibliographic data describing nonbook materials.

The system governing audio-visual media cataloging generally follows an arrangement by Dewey class number establishing consistency in methods for processing both books and nonbook items.

The book is arranged in two chapters. Chapter I, introductory in nature, defines the purpose of the book, the role of social studies in today's schools, the importance of civil defense content as part of the social studies curriculum, and discusses objectives of the games. Chapter II, presents games in a sequential manner progressing from the simple to the more complex.  Preliminary information, directions, and explanations precede each game with content guides included for some.

The varying interrelationships between the disciplines, the professional schools, and the professions are examined through the use of the concepts of systems, subsystems, and suprasystems. Although teacher education is a subsystem of the university, it also forms a part of the suprasystems of governmental units, the profession, and the community, and there is need for a collaborative relationship between teacher  education/university/profession and school unit/community state. Some conclusions indicate that education should be viewed as the training function of the teaching profession; teacher education should be regarded as a professional school; there should be less emphasis on teacher education as an all-university function; accountability and responsiveness should be sharply defined; and local and state government responsibility should be reduced.

The figures, however, indicate four areas of consideration before the aims can be implemented: 1) There is a relatively low  percentage of institutions engaging in preparing students for inner-city schools; 2) There is a definite lack of communications contributing to the disorganization of teacher education programs; 3) There is no common agreement of appropriate content for required introductory course; and 4) There is a number of institutions reporting no changes in their teacher education programs over the last 5 years.

The Pennsylvania Department of Education designed the nine 90-minute workshop program into three parts a) an introduction to psychosocial issues involved in pupil  creativity, b) a review of the factors of pupil creativity which are under the teachers' control, and c) the presentation of practical alternatives which are available to teachers. Teachers and pupils were tested in the fall of 1970 and again in the spring of 1971. The in-service program was well-received by the teachers.

Results in the boys' athletic section showed 1,593 coaches earning a mean compensation of $532. In the final section on non-athletic activities, compensation for advising or directing activities, directors of instrumental music (primarily band directors) and yearbook advisors were the highest paid, with mean compensations of $585 and $434 respectively.

The program was organized by the Asian Institute for Teacher Educators, Quezon City, Philippines, with the cooperation of UNESCO. The government of Thailand helped organize the program for the following group of member states: Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Singapore, and Thailand. The program centered around seminars on the progress of teacher education in the participating Asian member states, seminars on integration and modernization, and workshops on integration and modernization (applying a systems approach to integration and modernization of teacher education). Three general conclusions found a) lack of relevance to existing social needs  and aspirations, b) divergence between theory and practices, and c) divergence between training institutions and school systems. Further conclusions dealt with integrated curriculum, research, teaching procedures, methods and techniques, social relevance of teacher education and status of teachers. Appendixes include lists of officeholders, participants, and observers; agenda and work schedules; and lists of participants in the working groups.

Tedeschi's SEV theory of social influence correctly predicted that non-preinformed subjects should emit more critical responses to the more esteemed than to the less esteemed experimenter, but a prediction based on previous research that preinformation should linearly heighten the effects of experimenter esteem was not supported; preinformation reversed the effects of esteem variables.

Data were gathered by questionnaires mailed to recent Ph.D. recipients in 18 departments of arts and sciences at the University. In the questionnaire, about 152 separate items were examined concerning four dependent variables: time, interaction, pre-professional experience, and openness. Significant differences appeared between the non-research group and  one or more of the research-connected groups on 69 items. Correlations of scores indicate that research does appear to exist as a separately identifiable activity in student experience.

Questionnaires were administered to 110 teachers from nine open-space elementary schools and 120 teachers from eight traditional elementary schools, all with predominantly middle-class suburban populations. The major findings showed that open-space school teachers were more satisfied with their jobs, felt more autonomous, and reported more influence in decision making. In traditional schools, ambitious teachers tended to be more dissatisfied with teaching than did unambitious teachers. Women teachers interested in verticle promotion were less satisfied than women without such  interests. Open schools appear to give teachers professional ambition which becomes an important source of job satisfaction.

A theory based on the concept of socialization was offered to explain the teacher attitude change. A research sample was composed of 86 beginning secondary school teachers in Seattle public schools in 1970-71, 34 principals, and 213 experienced teachers. The Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory measured permissive-authoritarian attitudes while further data concerning conditions related to the beginning teachers' experience was obtained by using questionnaires. Results of the data analysis supported some parts of the theory but required others to  be rejected. Major observations were that a) the average change toward authoritarianism was probably too small to be of consequence, b) beginning teachers perceived their principals and the faculty of their school as being much more authoritarian than was the case, c) the beginning teachers' perceptions of their principals authoritarian attitudes was correlated with their changes of attitude, and d) the more authoritarian the attitude held by the beginning teacher at the start of the year, the less was the increase in authoritarianism that occurred during the year.

Sixty teachers from the Stanford University Secondary Teacher Education Program 1969-70 participated in the training program. Two procedures to promote teacher responsiveness were formulated. One procedure trained teachers to listen and summarize student feedback for later use. This procedure consisted of two one-hour instructional tape recordings separated by a 15-minute break. The other procedure sensitized teachers to respond to student feedback \"appropriately\" with verbal replies and suggestions of learning  activities. This procedure included a one-hour instructional program of reading, video tape reviewing, and discussion. Results of the listening skills training program showed that trainees improved their ability to recall essential points from tape recorded excerpts. There were no significant differences between the groups receiving response appropriateness training and the groups that did not receive such training. Responsive behavior may be more relevant when the teacher can attune himself to each student's academic and personal needs. (MJM)",

Twenty-six candidates were exposed to the instructional systems built around three models of teaching during the fall of 1970. The models were Synectics, Concept-Attainment, and Group Investigation. The candidates practiced the models in the classroom in which they were student teaching, observers coded their teaching behavior, and the response of their students using the  Teacher Innovator System. Behavior was also rated in terms of the specifications of each of the models. Samples of the teaching behavior of each teacher candidate were obtained when he was not practicing the models of teaching as well as samples of teaching episodes of the cooperating teachers.

This report grows out of the task force examination of the use of paraprofessional personnel, in concept and operational terms. The report has been divided into three areas: a) educational manpower, b) differentiated staffing, and c) AOTE's role. The first section concerns the need for an educational transformation having a new clarity of educational objectives and a different organization of manpower to achieve the goals of a human community with work skills and cooperative living. Part II deals with the concept of new roles in the learning-teaching process, some models of the concept, and some considerations extracted from a broad  base of experiences which are relative to the process of model research and development. The final section describes the stance and role of AOTE within the limits of its resources. Each section contains references. (MJM)",

One hundred and ninety teachers from California elementary schools were divided and placed into sections of teaching teams or self-contained classrooms. Of the teaching team section, 75 teachers were assigned to work in 20 teams, and 20 teachers were assigned to work as individuals. The other group from self-contained classrooms included 75 teachers assigned to 20 ad hoc groups and 20 working as individuals. Decision-making behavior was measured by the way in which subjects evaluated a given set of alternative courses of action in regard to each of two problems of student  behavior. The decision consisted of ranking these alternatives after they had been evaluated. The quality of the decision was determined by comparing the subjects' ranking with an average ranking obtained from 15 experts. The verbal and nonverbal behavior of groups was recorded and analyzed using the Bales Interaction Process Analysis. Results showed that groups were more extreme than individuals in evaluating the consequences of teacher behavior, ad hoc groups displayed more tension than teams, and smaller groups showed more solidarity and less disagreement than did larger ones.

Fifty-four Stanford teacher trainees representing the subject-matter areas of social studies, English, mathematics, and science participated in the study. Half of each subject matter area group received the Xerox Corporation's \"Effective Listening\" training program and listening pre- and posttests, and half received the listening tests but no training. After training and/or testing, trainees were videotaped while conducting classroom discussions. They were given no information to indicate that the video tapes were related to the listening training program. Interns who received  listening training improved on listening posttests relative to interns who did not receive training. Training in subject matter did not influence teacher performance. Three raters analyzed the video tapes of classroom discussions and tabulated teacher statements and questions related to input from statements. No significant treatment differences were found. Correlations in the experimental group show that those who did better in listening pre- and posttests also made better use of student input during classroom discussions. Results suggest that teachers' listening skills can be improved by training. Verbal evidence of transfer of training was not found.

The subjects were teacher trainees and paid volunteer high school students who participated in Stanford's Teacher Education Program (STEP) in the summer of 1967. Data were obtained from the Intern Data Bank, a collection of information about teaching interns at Stanford.

        "description":"A series of seven experiments provided information on the relationship between the learning of prose and the structural importance of the linguistic subunits. Five samples of prose, including narrative folktales and two samples of textual prose, were studied to determine whether the patterning of learning corresponded to the structural importance of the respective verbal units. In this series, an objective method was devised for dividing complex verbal materials into linguistic subunits possessing psychological significance. The learners in Experiments I and II attempted a single verbatim reproduction of a narrative folktale either immediately after reading the folktale or after a seven-day retention interval. Two textual selections were studied in Experiments III and IV and  their structural importance rated. Experiment V was conducted to determine whether the relationship between structural importance and recall resulted from learners adopting a learning strategy in which more learning time was allocated to more important units. In Experiments VI and VII, a determination was made of the role of structural importance in the serial learning of linguistic subunits. From a methodological viewpoint, two of the techniques used possess the potential of having wide applicability to the analysis of text. These are: (1) the technique of segmenting prose according to locations of pausal acceptability, and (2) the technique whereby linguistic subunits within a prose passage may be hierarchically ordered.

        "description":"The first in a series of state-of-the art papers in the area of the teaching of English is presented. Reviews are made of relevant research, curriculum trends, teaching materials, the judgments of recognized experts in the field, reports and findings from various national committees and commission. The point is made that the teacher's image has never been as dominant in higher education as has the image of the scholar. A questionnaire sent to 60 departments of English was designed to bring out: (1) How large a part, in terms of courses, hours, and faculty involved, the English department has in the specific training of teachers; (2) What courses and what faculty were identified specifically as being a part of the English teacher preparation program; (3) What content and what  practices were to be found in the \"methods\" courses taught within the English department; and (4) What texts, evaluation techniques, innovations were used in courses in teacher preparation. Results include: (1) English departments are not very greatly involved in the preparation of teachers outside of the subject matter classes which comprise the program for English majors; and (2) Over half of the schools surveyed did not require additional courses for English teaching majors. Other surveys and their results are also presented. (Author/CK)",

        "description":"The use of paraprofessionals (lay readers, instructional aides, clerical aides, and homekeeping aides) in secondary English departments in a three-state area (Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan) is determined and evaluated. Chapter One reviews related literature, and Chapter Two surveys paraprofessionals in the English departments. Questionnaires were sent to schools using paraprofessionals and to schools that had discontinued using them. Findings relate to the following conclusions reached: (1) Larger schools (1,500 or more students) were more likely to use paraprofessionals and less likely to discontinue that use; (2) Schools seemed willing to hire lay readers but not instructional aides; (3) Paraprofessionals were paid near adequate salaries; (4) The involvement of English  department heads with the selection of paraprofessionals seemed inadequate; (5) Preschool and inservice training for both paraprofessionals and teachers who used paraprofessionals was unsatisfactory; (6) The evaluation policy was inadequate; and (7) The ratings of paraprofessional programs as successful by approximately 86% of the schools could be considered adequate. Recommendations for more effective use of paraprofessionals are made. Twenty-three tables and a bibliography are included. Appendix A is a Questionnaire Sent to Schools Using Paraprofessionals during the 1968-69 School Year; Appendix B is a Questionnaire Sent to Schools That Had Discontinued Paraprofessional Use.

The three exercises used in the writing assessment were: Age 9: The Forest Fire Exercise; Age 13: The Famous Person Exercise; and Age 17: The Famous Person Exercise. An exercise for young adults (Adults: The Commissioner Stroud Letter) required them to write formal letters to public officials expressing a viewpoint on an issue. The report contains separate chapters for each age group: Chapter 2 describes the essays written by 9-year-olds; Chapter 3 reports on 13-year-olds; and Chapters 4 and 5 describe 17-year-olds and young adults, respectively. Each chapter begins with an introductory statement about particularly important aspects of the essays that age group wrote.  Chapter 6 discusses The Differences between 9's, 13's, 17's and Adults. The results of the four analyses (overall quality, error counts, characterization, and computer) are presented under six headings: essay length, paragraphing, punctuation and capitalization, sentence structure, agreement, and words (spelling, vocabulary and usage). Six appendixes present: Procedures for Assigning Overall Quality Scores; Kinds of Errors Sought in the Error Count Analysis; Characterizations; Computer Scoring of Essays; Sample Percentages; and Best Essays.

Students wrote two 1,000 word composition samples, one during the first month of the study and one during the ninth month. The purposes of the before and after analyses were to determine: (1) whether or not the experimental factor (the teaching of linguistic grammars to the experimental subjects) was effective in increasing the frequency of use of the various combinational verb-phrase options in the writings of the experimental subjects as compared with the written samples of the control subjects, and (2) whether or not boys and girls demonstrated any significant difference  in their selection of the various verb-phrase options. Results of these analyses indicate that fifth-grade students show developmental growth in their performance in the use of verb + &quot;be&quot; in subordinate clauses. Growth factors that were significant only for the experimental subjects included the verbal combinations: verb ]&quot;be&quot; in the main clause; main verb in the subordinate clauses, verb ] modal and Verb ]&quot;have&quot; in their subordinate clauses. No significant difference was found in the frequency of verb-phrase options selected by boys and girls of either group in their before and after written samples. This study indicates that growth in elementary children's utilization of verb phrase structures is largely developmental. (Author/CK)",

The specific question studied is: How did the campus press perform in its coverage of the campus disorders of May 1970?Content and administrator and student staff attitudes were scrutinized. A four-member panel sifted all items dealing with the May disorders and divided them into two major categories. It was found that a major proportion of the space devoted the May disorders coverage dealt with local news of campus disorders. Another result of the study was that of the 45 sources interviewed, 69% felt favorably toward the newspaper's performance in the coverage of the disorders. Nearly all of the newspapers staff responding to an  open-ended questionnaire felt that the newspaper had performed very well in its coverage. One implication of the study is that campus press performed, in its failure to analyze news thoroughly, is echoing the performance of the commercial press and therefore, journalism education must be redirected.

The characteristics studied fall into four classes: (1) Load measures reflecting informational density, (2) Length measures based upon number of syllables, words, kernel sentences, clauses, or sentences in a passage, (3) Packaging measures based on alternative, gramatically equivalent ways for dealing with the same semantic material, and (4) Word frequency measures. Six studies comprising 14 experiments were conducted. Experimental materials consisted of paragraphs, lists of sentences, single sentences, and lists of words. In all but one of the six studies, the primary measure of learning was cumulative presentation time to a criterion of  one perfect rote recall of the experimental material, where presentation time during each exposure of the material was under the subject's control. Results include: (1) Paragraphs with a very high ratio between content words and total words in the paragraph required more time to learn than those with a lower content load; and (2) The time required to learn a set of sentences increased as the mean number of syllables per content word increased. Conclusions include: (1) Of the four types of stimulus characteristics studied, length has the most potent effects upon rote memorization; and (2) A number of relationships between independent and dependent variables were found to yield good fits to linear, power, or exponential equations.

        "description":"In a study of Negro children's listening comprehension, conducted in 1969, the following hypotheses were tested: (1) Beginning first-grade Negro dialect speakers who scored high, average, and low on readiness tests show no significant differences in their ability to answer literal comprehension questions about stories presented orally in standard English and in Negro dialects; and (2) When retelling stories presented to them orally in standard English or Negro dialect, beginning first-grade Negro dialect speaking children who scored high, average, and low on readiness tests, demonstrate no significant difference in the extent to which they include the following: a. Accurate literal statements, b. Accurate interpretative statements, and c. Evaluative statements. The listening  comprehension test consisted of four short fables which had animal characters and were considered free from cultural and sex bias. Ten questions were used to check literal comprehension of two of the stories, and all four stories and the questions were translated into Negro dialect. Sixty subjects, 10 boys and 10 girls in each of the three readiness categories, were assigned alternately to the standard English or the Negro dialect treatment group. Based on the results, it is concluded that use of Negro dialect or standard English made no significant difference in ability to answer literal questions; sex and level of readiness did, however.

Benefits derived from a descriptive writing unit are said to be the following: (1) Descriptive writing is fun; (2) It enables the instructor to demonstrate that the first word that pops into the writer's mind is often not the best one; (3) There is no easier way in which to teach grammar, especially parts of speech; (4) There is not better training in seeing the need for precise word selection and for developing this skill; (5) It aids the student in developing craftmanship in his writing. Practical application of these theories of value include: an image quiz; demonstration of conscious word selection using a step-by-step approach until a one sentence description is created; introduction of figures of  speech and words that appeal to the senses; emphasis on reader involvement; introduction of the entire area of diction in connection with the consideration of what the reader will respond to and how he will respond. In writing the longer essay, the student should become an observer and note-taker; learn to organize or preplan his material; become knowledgable in the use of transitional devices; and become aware of the importance of tone and mood.

The English teacher is said to be accountable to his students, his colleagues within and outside his discipline, to the parents of his students and to the larger local community which supports the schools, and to state, national, and other local groups. Those who are said to be accountable to the English teacher are the students, the parents, administrators, and the wider communities. It is concluded that it is the English teacher's obligation to take up an active role in clarifying for himself, his students, his colleagues, and his several communities what he is trying to do in the educational process, what conditions he  needs in order to have a chance of success, and what means may be used to evaluate that success.

Chapter Two, Bringing the History of English into the Classroom, concerns itself with answering the question of why the teacher should concern himself with the transfer of his knowledge of the history of English into the classroom. Chapter Three, Content and Technique for the Classroom, Content and Technique for the Classroom, defines language briefly as a system of arbitrary vocal symbols which men communicate with. Chapter Four, Structuring a Unit on the  History of English, emphasizes that a teacher should create his own unit. Chapter Five, The History of the English Language and Literature, discusses the relationship between language and literature. Chapter Six, For the Teacher and the Future, emphasizes that the teacher should constantly be building a body of language material. (Author/CK)",

        "description":"An age-normed test battery was developed for use as a research instrument to assess strengths and weaknesses in the sensory-motor development of elementary school age children. The importance of sensory-motor functions for the child's total development and learning is noted. The experimental sensory-motor test battery consists of 12 subtests, and requires approximately 20 to 25 minutes to be administered to an individual child; however, a group of three or four children can be individually tested in about 45 minutes. The subtests are administered in the following order: 1. bead stringing, 2. first-edge-palm, 3. block transfer, 4. bean bag throw, 5. sitting, bending, reaching, 6. standing broad jump, 7. shuttle run, 8. lying on floor to standing position, 9. sit-ups, 10. walking  board, 11. one foot balance (eyes open and eyes closed), and 12. chair push-ups. The standardization sample consisted of 744 Caucasian children, 6 through 12 years of age, from Kindergarten through Grade 6. The major evidence at present concerning the validity of the instrument was provided by the factor analysis of the intercorrelations for each age group. The five factors were interpreted as: &quot;hand-eye coordination,&quot;&quot;balance,&quot;&quot;explosive strength or impulsion,&quot;&quot;flexibility,&quot; and &quot;visually guided movement.&quot; The minimum estimates of internal consistency reliability of the subtests range from .44 to .88.

        "description":"A method for assessing the structure of organization was developed on the basis of the ordinal separation, or proximity, between pairs ot items in recall protocols over a series of trials. The proximity measure is based on the assumption, common to all indices of organization, that items which are coded together in subjective memory units will consistently tend to be recalled contiguously in output. Methods of hierarchical cluster analysis are then employed to determine the structure of organization implied by the proximities between items. An experiment was designed to test the sensitivity of the method to differences in organizational structure. Existing data from several studies of part-whole transfer by Ornstein were reanalyzed to assess the explanatory power of the method of  proximity analysis. It was concluded that the method of proximity analysis can be useful in attempts to elucidate the relationship between organization and memory. (Author/DG)",

A fourth scale, which appears to be a measure of goal-deficiency, was also developed. The four scales--tentatively identified as Intrinsic Motivation (IM), Self Enhancement (SE), Person Orientation (PO), and Goal Deficiency (GD)--were found to be relatively independent of one another and to have a high degree of reliability with respect to test-retest stability. Provisional norms, based on 649 females and 650 males, were established. Item content and correlates of the scales suggest that the four new experimental scales should have special relevance for description and analysis of  motivation in relation to work and education.

With the exception of one subject on one questionnaire, no such evidence for stable intransitivities was found. Consequently, the inconsistency explanation was investigated by a factor analysis of nine variables derived from the  subjects' choices. These variables were measures of consistency, transitivity and discrimination among stimuli. Results of this analysis suggest that the assumption of circular choices as synonymous with inconsistency is upheld for three of the five questionnaires. (Author/MS)",

This article examines whether the CIPP model also serves the retroactive purpose of providing information for accountability.

If so, the CIPP Model is a powerful tool for making and implementing decisions and for post hoc accounting for those decisions and actions. The remainder of the article describes the CIPP Model, presents a conceptualization of accountability, and analyzes the potential of the CIPP Model for meeting the information requirements of accountability.

Test items were intercorrelated and the resultant matrices factored, first weighting with Guttman weights then with rights-only ones. More variance was accounted for by the first several factors of Guttman-weighted tests than by these same factors in rights-only weighted tests. The tests for which there was most increase in variance were those for which there was greatest  increase in internal consistency. Finally, the factor structure and conventionally-weighted tests were quite different. The implication of these structural changes on test validity is discussed. (Author)",

This technique yields a set of item response weights for a psychological inventory which maximizes the internal consistency of the inventory for a group of subjects. Although the technique has been used for many years, its mathematical foundations have not been made explicit. In the present paper, it is shown that the informal data processing procedures of this technique actually solve the set of linear equations yielded by Guttman's Least Squares Model for internal consistency scaling. The Method of Reciprocal Averages can be implemented as a simple extension to existing item analysis computer programs. (Author/CK)",

The main findings were that (a) density increases (Proportion of intentional to total sentences) resulted in a reduction of intentional learning but did not affect incidental learning; and (b) specifically stated objectives produced more intentional learning than did general objectives. Incidental learning was influenced by density and specificity of directions. This suggests that presentation of objectives will not interfere with incidental learning. (Author)",

Program objectives served as guideposts for each center to: (1) motivate the undereducated adult of the core urban area, and (2) provide a program integrating innovative methods, materials, and programs of learning.

Specific objectives include: (1) to enable each class member to formulate and to defend a philosophy and rationale of ABE which is consistent with his own beliefs and with the characteristics and expectations of the undereducated adult, (2) to enable each class member to formulate and defend important criteria which must be present to have a \"successful\" community Adult Basic Education program, (3) to reach consensus about the fundamental principles involved in the learning process, and (4) to provide a learning environment in which the participants may design  and conduct meaningful learning experiences. Full use was made of three methods of study: the class, self-directed study, and the community. The adult learning process was introduced through a presentation on an overhead projector of Havighurst's development tasks of the adult. The section on community resources was developed around a practicum experience wherein each class member was responsible to determine those resources in his community which lend themselves to an improved ABE program.

In the development of the syllabus for this course, a considerable amount of time was spent using the curriculum development process described by Ralph Tyler. A broad range of concepts and behavior patterns were identified in the literature. Those concepts and behaviors which occurred most frequently were included in the course of study. The syllabus was designed to allow maximum flexibility in a course of study. The significance of each area of study was presented for the purpose of helping the instructor understand why the concept or behavior should receive consideration. The behavioral objectives were developed for the expressed purpose of providing  direction to the process of changing the behaviors of the teachers of adults. The suggested areas to study contain the concepts and behaviors pertaining to adult teaching and learning which appear necessary to the achievement of the stated objectives. A variety of learning experiences have been suggested so that the teachers of adults will have an opportunity to achieve the behavioral objectives. Effective evaluation is needed to determine how well one is succeeding in achieving the objectives. A number of ways have been suggested to evaluate the behavioral objectives.

The point is made that the status of adult as opposed to adolescent is achieved when the individual reaches full physical growth, has entered the job market full time, and is seriously in the process of establishing a family. It is also pointed out that deprivation, in this report, refers to the absence of a sufficiently supporting environment in areas of fundamental needs. This study is directed to the internal effects upon the individual through the sensory processes. It has been found that the adult learner shares with the teacher in training an incomplete development in relation to an integrative view of life and their role in it. He also shares with the teacher the  motivation to continue development toward greater maturity. Since it has been shown that the adult basic education student is a person not too basically different from the teacher, it is concluded that the educative experience is a mutually cooperative act.

Test results show that: (1) Those participating in the youth phase of the program did change their eating habits somewhat; (2) Most of the young people in the program know what foods to eat to keep healthy; yet, almost all of the participants fall below the recommended levels in their eating habits; and (3) If the program is to serve a useful purpose, a system should be implemented to decrease the drop-out rate.

There is widespread confidence in the belief that technology itself holds the answers; (3) Opinions regarding environment appear to be rather fixed, at least in communities where specific measures are under debate;  (4) On three major environmental issues of 1970--mining in the BWCA, the steel plant, and taconite--opinions on pollution control measures vary sharply according to whether the measure has direct consequences for the community involved; (5) Being more informed about environmental issues does not necessarily mean that a person will be more favorable toward controls; and (6) Environment has the potential for intense conflict within and between communities.

Data for test of the hypothesis are from two field studies, each dealing with reader attitudes and decoding of one news article on each of two issues. One survey was in St. Paul and dealt with open housing and police enforcement of laws. The other was in Monticello, Minnesota area northwest of Minneapolis and was concerned with the DDT banning issue and a controversy over construction and operation of a nuclear generating plant. Each respondent in the two studies was asked to read and state from recall his understanding of two articles which had actually appeared  in one of the Twin Cities metropolitan newspapers in months preceding the studies. Position on each issue was measured according to summated responses to seven agree-disagree items selected from statements attributed to various interest groups, public officials, and spokesmen. Understanding was defined operationally as the number of accurate statements offered by a respondent about an article after reading it. The most relevant data for the narrower selective understanding hypothesis are the eta coefficients for the association between attitudes and understanding. It was found that for DDT and the two St. Paul issues, there is no consistent relationship between position and understanding. Education and open-mindedness remain the principle correlates of understanding on these two issues.  (CK)",

Six types of emotionality--fight, flight, pairing, dependency, counter-dependency, and counter-pairing--are defined. The four levels of the concept of work are given. Related research is discussed. In the present study, it was hypothesized that there were positive relationships between group relevant aspects of personality in small instructional groups of adults and the learner's learning achievement and satisfaction. Forty volunteer 4-H leaders participated in a  two-day workshop. The learners ranged in age from 27 to 57. Data for the study were collected both prior to the workshop from learners and instructors and from the learners at each instructional session during the workshop. Statistical analysis of the data was carried out. The findings did not produce a uniform pattern of associations of sufficient strength to support the hypothesis. The diversity in results from group to group and from instructor to instructor point to the fact that group relevant aspects of personality had a measurable effect. (DB)",

Particular emphasis is given to those aspects which most affected the lives of young people who receive only the minimum compulsory schooling before entering employment as apprentices or unskilled workers. Parts II, III and IV review the steps being taken by the education and other authorities responsible for the education and training of these young people to strengthen their capacity to respond to this challenge. Some  implications for the recruitment, training and professional development of their teachers are explored briefly in Part V. Part VI attempts to suggest answers to two questions: (1) Is the educational response adequate to meet the socioeconomic challenge? and (2) What more needs to be done?

The objectives of the tour were to examine: (1) the provision made for residential adult education overseas (the U.S.); (2) the relationship between the various agencies providing adult education, and, in turn, their relationship with the formal structure of education; (3) examples of the provision of adult education &quot;at a distance,&quot; that is without the presence of a tutor at the point where the students are studying; and (4) the use of frequency modulated broadcasting in adult education. The introduction discusses the use of the term &quot;adult education&quot; in North America and the British usage. Areas of education  included in the term &quot;adult education&quot; are External Degrees, Continuing Education, and Liberal Education. Other topics discussed in the report are: Residential Adult Education; Workers' Education; The Use of Technical Resources; Co-operation between Agencies; Adult Education at a Distance (discussion group programs, correspondence programs, the Open University); and financing Adult Education.

        "description":"An attempt to estimate the growth of literacy in India in the next 20 years is presented. Consideration is taken of existing facilities and the likely increase of present literacy programs. The point is made that the expansion of primary education was mainly responsible for the growth of literacy in the country. Estimates presented are based on school enrollment in the past and the anticipated school enrollment in the future up to 1981. Two age groups of 5-9 and 10-14 were chosen for this study. The total number of literates in each age group was broken into its component parts in terms of the school enrollment in the age group in the year 1961 and the previous years in the standard accepted initially as the minimum level for census literacy. Data analysis showed that the number  of literates in these age groups calculated from the school enrollments in 1961 and the preceding years fell far below the number of literates as enumerated in the census. It is concluded that completion of the second standard of the primary education in India enables one to achieve literacy of the level laid down by the Census of India. It is also concluded that the bulk of the working force in the country will remain in the same state of illiteracy in the next 20 years as at present, and will require at least another 20 years for achieving 100 per cent literacy of the Census level, if the present conditions are to continue indefinitely in the future.

To achieve these objectives, Functional Literacy Projects should concentrate on: (1) regions and economic sectors having high priority in national development, (2) specific problems and activities forming the basis of development plans, and (3) population groups and individuals who are sufficiently motivated but whose illiteracy constitutes an obstacle to the implementation of a development project.

The specific objectives of this pilot study were to obtain the qualitative and quantitative measurements of: (1) the attainment and use of literacy skills, (2) the impact of the program on the individual, and (3) the teaching/learning situation. The study was conducted on an &quot;ex-post-facto&quot; basis using experimental and matched control groups. Primary data was gathered by a team of seven interviewers. The experimental group consisted of adult  farmers, drawn from 12 villages. Factors used for measurement purposes covered the following areas: (1) the literacy skills attained by the participants, (2) the impact on agriculture of the knowledge of improved farm practices, (3) the teaching learning situation. Findings include: (1) At least 80% of the participants achieved literacy skills of varying degrees of utility; and (2) The final rate of adoption of agricultural practices among the participants and control groups and its relationship to literacy ability indicated that the rate of adoption among the functional literates and control illiterates tended to vary directly with literacy level.

Professional journals, reports, and personal letters or interviews were used to obtain information on the experiences of health agencies and other professional groups with the use of television for recruitment. Recommendations resulting from the study are: (1) The Canadian Public Health Association (CPHA) should undertake a program of recruitment through the mass media, and this program should be directed particularly towards those who are making career decisions (for the first or second time); (2) This mass media program should be planned for distribution through both French- and English-language media; (3) This program should have coverage across Canada; (4) Any use of television  for recruitment proposed by the CPHA should be planned as part of a total program using more personal approaches; and (5) That a research study of the effectiveness of television for this purpose should be a part of any television program undertaken by the CPHA. The possibilities of making some use of the radio should also be considered. The CPHS is advised to produce films concerning public health careers for use on television; to sponsor workshops for health personnel; to produce and distribute spots for television; and to set up a follow-up and evaluation program. A two-year budget is provided, as are references and three health career films. (DB)",

Planning for a course of training began with identification of training needs. The courses devised were largely &quot;non-technical&quot; in nature. An analysis of the planning process with respect to the ten courses offered shows that where the courses were conceived of by the Vidyapeeth the cooperative agencies assumed on the whole a relatively passive role. In the planning stage, several factors were taken into account: (1) the level of the trainee, (2) the relationship of the  syllabus to the life conditions of the trainee, and (3) a minimum size for the sub-units of a course. The assessment revealed that about half the courses were reasonably well organized and the other half were poorly organized. More careful planning is recommended. (CK)",

The polyvalent approach to adult education is based on the following principles: (1) An adult worker's educational needs are multiple; (2) Educational opportunities should be available over the entire period of the worker's life; (3) The main emphasis in such education is on his &quot;functionality&quot;; and (4) Different educational subjects are usually given in an integrated and inter-dependent manner. Steps in planning the program include: (1)  identification of objectives (2) identification of needs in the community and identification of groups that need education, (3) analysis of job requirements, (4) development of an integrated curriculum, and (5) selection and training of a part-time staff.

To provide this evaluation, information was collected using mailed questionnaires from 263 Junior-Class and 198 Open-Class exhibitors. Data were obtained concerning social characteristics of exhibitors, exhibiting procedures and attitudes, and changes which might be needed at county and district fairs. Sixty-nine percent of the Junior exhibitors and 54 percent of the Open-Class exhibitors maintained that they had learned &quot;much&quot; or &quot;very much&quot; from their exhibiting experience. It is believed that important needs pertaining to education and social acceptance are met by exhibiting at county and district fairs. (DB)",

The study sub-objectives were: (1) to provide a general description of the demographic characteristics of the groups surveyed; (2) to describe the nature and extent of their involvement in fair-related work; (3) to determine their evaluation of judging at fairs; (4) to determine the general evaluation of fairs and what might be done to improve them; and (5) to answer some questions about the state subsidy for County and District Fairs, and the possible consolidation of fairs. The five groups who were sent questionnaires were: Youth Leaders (voluntary leaders of 4-H clubs), Vocational Agriculture Teachers, 4-H Club Agents, County Agents, and  Fair Judges. The data gathered suggest that county and district fairs fill important needs of the people in Wisconsin. County and district fairs were adjudged to fill not only educational needs, but social and vocational needs as well. The 4-H Club Agents appear to be the most involved in fair work and Vocational Agriculture Teachers the least. An appendix presents tabulations of the questionnaire data. (DB)",

The results of the study suggest that if the decreasing trends of exhibitors and exhibits is not halted and reversed, then fairs as they are  now known will soon be a thing of the past; this decline suggests a general weakening of the educational function and impact of fairs. Solutions offered are: (1) make fairs more youth oriented and involve youth in planning of fairs; (2) construct more multipurpose facilities for year-round use; and (3) consolidate or eliminate State support of some of the smaller, weaker or less successful fairs.

        "description":"Data were obtained on the activities and attiudes of 48 associate members and 229 commercial exhibitors at county and district fairs. Questionnaires and interviews were used to collect the data. Analysis of the data showed that most associate members had participated in more than one county or district fair in 1970, but less than one-fifth had participated in the Wisconsin State Fair. Commercial exhibitors had exhibits at only one county or district fair, and only 1 in 10 had participated at the state fair or at Farm Progress Days in 1970. The majority of both associate members and commercial exhibitors employed the equivalent of less than two full-time employees for fair work, but some employed the equivalent of 10 or more full-time employees throughout the year for fair work.  About one-fifth of all respondents obtained at least 40% of their gross income from fairs. Slightly less than half of the commercial exhibitors spent $250 or more to exhibit at the fairs. Most respondents maintained that elimination of the fairs would have a marked impact upon them. Slightly more than half of the respondents specified changes that they felt should be made to improve fairs--improving the facilities, organization, and administration. Implications of the study results are that two main characteristics must be recognized: (1) fairs are composed of both local and non-local people, and (2) the motives of people involved in fairs may be altruistic or personal.

The social characteristics of county board chairmen and fair secretaries were similar. All of the board chairmen were males; 88% of the secretaries were males. The average ages were 57 and 52, respectively. Compared with other people in the state, board chairmen and fair secretaries were found to be relatively well educated generally. Most of both groups had attended more than one county or district fair, but had not attended the State Fair. Most fair operations represent a complex mix of  public and private enterprise; the majority in the state are private. However, county governments usually own the land and are involved in the construction or upkeep of the fair buildings; they also make cash contributions to the fairs. The respondents wanted to have both junior and open-class exhibits at their fairs. Specific suggestions for making fairs more educationally valuable for young people included greater community support, improved programs, and greater involvement of the young people in planning and operating the fairs.

A list of federally funded adult education programs was compiled for comparison purposes. Data requests were limited to two items: numbers of students and numbers of teachers. Respondents were asked to rate the adult education programs for which  they provided data to indicate whether the purpose was primarily or secondarily for basic education, high school diploma, occupational training, general or college subjects, or other.

The major objective of the project was to demonstrate the adaptability of the IPI System (Individually Prescribed Instruction) to the needs of ABE centers. This was accomplished by field testing the IPI program, modified for adults, in a number of ABE centers. The tests indicate that administrative and teacher training programs must be modified, and a variety of materials distribution and organizational models are needed to meet the requirements of the different ABE centers. The &quot;streamlining&quot; of the elementary program resulted in: the new ILA (Individualized Learning for Adults) Mathematics Continuum, presented in five areas rather than 13; the average number of pages in a skill booklet has  been reduced; and the Placement Testing procedures have been simplified. The program has also been broadened to include an Applications Area, and the upper level of all areas include topics to assist the student in preparing for the GED examination. The Reading program is being extended into a Communications Skills program. Data collected for the evaluation served four purposes: Description of the Field Test Sites; Evaluation of the Implementation of the IPI System; Program Content Modification; and Estimation of Student Gain. Results of the ILA Mathematics Achievement Test show that students do learn in the Adult-IPI system. (Author/DB)",

Recommendations of the study are: (1) Establish a regularized school-community input and feedback system to enable parents, students and community persons to provide both input and feedback related to curriculum and teaching methodologies; (2) Institute a comprehensive and coordinated pre-school program to diagnose, remediate, and alleviate learning difficulties in pre-school children; (3) Provide experiences to ease the transition from elementary to junior high schools; (4) Introduce added vocational majors and courses into the high school and  added academic offerings into the vocational school; (5) Establish a comprehensive Secondary Academy and Adult Education Center to afford opportunities for students 17 years of age or older to attend classes that would earn high school credit; and (6) Change the class organization for the junior and senior high schools to allow small groups of students to progress throughout their secondary school program with the same home room teacher, core-subject teachers and the same counselor.

Specific purposes of the project were: (1) to find a way to obtain and retain attendance at prenatal classes of expectant mothers who live in low socioeconomic urban areas, (2) to identify factors affecting their attendance at the classes, and (3) to provide comparative data on the expectant mothers who attended the classes and on others from the same area who knew about the classes but did not attend. A series of prenatal classes was developed, consisting of seven classes to be held at weekly intervals. Each class lasted approximately one and a half hours. Interviews were conducted with all expectant mothers who attended the classes to obtain  health and socioeconomic information. Findings of the project include: (1) Expectant mothers who live in lower socioeconomic urban areas will attend prenatal classes; (2) The most desirable site for the classes proved to be a hospital located near the mothers' homes, and the best time to hold meetings was in the evening; and (3) Health practices of expectant mothers who attended the classes were better than those of expectant mothers who did not attend.

        "description":"Several writers suggest that reducing one's sense of individuality reduces social restraints. The author suggests that the effect of uniformity of appearance on aggression is unclear when anonymity is held constant. This poses a problem of interpretation given that a distinction must be made between lack of individuality and anonymity. One must hold anonymity constant if one is to generate support for the notion that lack of individuality reduces social restraints. The present research addresses this problem. Subjects, ostensibly participating in an empathy study, were asked to administer a stressful noise to a victim engaged in a learning task. Subjects were encouraged to aggress on each of 20 trials. Results showed that \"hooded\" subjects aggressed with significantly lower  latencies than nametag subjects; and in the nonvisible cells, hooded subjects had significantly longer latencies than nametag subjects. It was concluded that the degree of anonymity provided to a subject affects perception of aggression severity. (Author/RK)",

The authors emphasize that given these limitations, data from measures cannot at this point clearly establish the validity of theoretical positions that emphasize counterarguing as an intervening concept. When responses on the measure correspond to various other elements in the nomological net in a prediction fashion, however, there will be more confidence in the theory and in the measure than if the predicted relationship fails to occur. The authors further found that the utility of counterargument measures inheres not so much in settings where the predicted outcome is obtained but rather in the opposite. The authors conclude that  although measuring counterarguing presents complex problems that resist solution, research should continue. Attitude change theorists should note the fallibility of such measures and remain cautious when using data from them to substantiate a theoretical position. (RK)",

The author uses this rationale as the main reason for his commentary on the value of empathy in counseling effectiveness. The author suggests that if counselors are convinced of the importance of empathy, 2 types of practical questions should be raised. The first concerns the learning of empathy and the unbiased assessment of one's own level of empathy in interviews. The other concerns the adequacy of counselor empathy to produce the desired change in the client. The author also discusses empathy from the viewpoint of learning theorists and provides some implications from this viewpoint. Finally, the author provides some discussion regarding the  importance of empathy in the overall plan of treatment. The author concludes by suggesting that more refined definitions as well as more precise measurement of empathy's effects must be developed. (RK)",

Its purpose is to describe rather than to test hypotheses, but some general conclusions can be drawn from the results. The data were obtained from the questionnaire responses of 300 college students attending Howard and American Universities in Washington. The results support several general conclusions: (1) With respect to the effects of sex and race on the criterion variables of interest, evidence suggests the prevalence of a &quot;cultural lag&quot; in egalitarianism among males as compared with females. Although blacks are more traditional as measured by the Role Conception Inventory, when it comes to personal preferences, race has little effect  and blacks are not more traditional than whites; (2) Attitudes toward housework and child care remain relatively traditional for the 4 groups while attitudes toward what could be called career related categories are relatively more liberal, especially on the part of white females.

One general hypothesis of the study was that influence perceptions of group members depend upon the phases of decision-making in which they participate. Another was that the effects of participation would vary with the nature of the decision task or with issues to be resolved. Referencing the size of the &quot;influence pie&quot;, total intragroup influence was predicted to be greater in facilitative than in contrastive conditions. Finally, the relationships between perceived influence and satisfaction, and between participation and satisfaction, were seen to be dependent on individual differences in power and affiliation motivation. The summary includes that (1) a viable theory of power in  organizations must take into account differences in organizational situations and the characteristics of individuals who perform organizational roles. For example, sex was found to determine perceptions of influence in varying participative settings; and (2) interpersonal power in a group or organizational setting is conceived of as an intervening process outcome, rather than a structural given or a terminal effect.

The 2nd investigation, that of the nonmedical drug use among college student psychiatric patients, was carried out concomitantly with the first investigation. The results of the study suggest that  typical drug users: (1) may be male or female; (2) primarily smoke marijuana alone or in combination with drugs about once a week; (3) use drugs mainly out of curiosity; (4) are nonreligious; and (5) are enrolled primarily in the general college and earn grades as good as those of nonusers.

An ecological perspective is used, in which any change in the behavior of persons affects the style of living of the environment, just as changes in the operation of the social environment affect the lives of individuals. Two high school environments are being studied, longitudinally, for consequences for the students of the 2 demographically similar yet socially distinct schools. To date, the ecological thesis affirms that personal development can be accomplished if criteria for the socialization of competences are met. These include: (1) a diversity of formal and informal  settings to encourage social interaction; (2) a variety of informal roles in the social environment to allow for spontaneous help-giving and for personal interactions across divergent roles; and (3) valuing varied competences and people who contribute these competences to the larger competences to the larger community.

The findings suggest that, in general, the research in group counseling is not disciplined, controlled research. The mixed and conflicting results of the research are indicative of the methods and procedures utilized in the studies. The research neither proves nor disproves the usefulness of group counseling in improving academic achievement, changing attitudes, or modifying personality variables. Other problems found relate to: (1) lack of adherence to the  experimental design employed; (2) lack of specifically stated hypotheses or the failure to adhere to the hypotheses in the course of the study; (3) failure to delineate treatments with hypotheses; and (4) failure to use adequate samples and criteria measurements.

To decrease the out-of-center behavior, access to a 30-minute special activity time was made available to different groups as a function of everyone remaining within his group instructional center. One occurrence of out-of-center behavior resulted in a cost of 10 minutes of special activity time for the children in that center. The frequency of out-of-center behaviors quickly decreased from baseline 1 to the modification 1 condition, increased when the modification condition was removed, and decreased again in modification 11. Observations made on the percent of the children's appropriate social and academic behaviors showed increases during the  modification conditions. Also, the time the teacher spent in responding to inappropriate behavior decreased and the time spent in instruction increased during the modification conditions. (Author)",

It was assumed that teachers' intellectual ability, personality and personal experience were the most influential variables affecting pupil growth. Conclusions showed that (1) teacher characteristics do influence significantly the growth of fourth, fifth, and sixth grade self-contained classes with a mean I.Q. of 120 or better; (2) no single teacher characteristic was significantly related to all areas of convergent and divergent growth in the children's scores than were the other variables studied; (4) in general, the teacher who appeared to have most significantly influenced growth in the divergent areas  were emotionally mature, energetic, persistent, friendly, and without a crystallized compulsive pattern for attaining social approval; and (5) in general, the teacher who appeared ot have most significantly influenced growth in the convergent area was submissive, dependent, cheerful, alert, not a staunch guardian of morals and manners with a natural warmth and liking for people.

He suggests the Informational System for Vocational Decisions (ISVD) and recommends a process whereby data about educational, military, and vocational opportunities are turned by each inquirer into information about a personally-determined career. The data are primarily like the files of abstracts created by Educational Research Information Centers (ERIC) system. The system guides the inquirer through personal interaction with the data files. In order to check, evaluate, and encourage understanding a computer control function called Monitor is further explained. Monitor operates at various levels of awareness related to different stages of exercising personal  responsibility during the decision-making uses of the ISVD. Implications for counseling include becoming familiar with computerized guidance information systems, their potential for improved guidance services by bringing facts and data and their scientific processing directly to the inquirer as well as the means of economically making them feasible within one's own institution.

It was hypothesized that developmental group counseling would improve peer relations. Group counseling in the schools seems particularly appropriate because of the nature of both the setting and the students. The elementary school student is at a stage in his life in which it is inevitable that he will decrease his total dependence on adult models and seek identification with his peers. Group counseling can provide opportunities for peer interaction in the presence of an understanding adult and without being dependent upon powers of censure and approval. Developmental group counseling provides the opportunity for each child to engage in an  interpersonal process, through which he works in the peer group, to explain his feelings, attitudes, values, and problems, with the result that he is better able to deal with developmental tasks. Results showed that third grade boys and girls showed the greatest improvement in sociometric status; and girls at all grade levels profited more than the boys. (Author/TA)",

Each session was rated by over 600 respondents. They rated each numbered response on an optical scoring sheet using the Stupp Warm-Cold Scale. A further objective of the study was the determination of factors common to all three orientations and those unique to a single orientation. It was possible to develop from the counselor responses two unique styles of counseling-one was labeled as the Reconstructive style and the  second as the Analytical Problem-Solving style. Counselors were trained in these two styles and conducted counseling sessions using both styles. Based on the sessions, it was concluded that client behavior varies as a function of counselor style.

In part one, description of the issues in principle is outlined and represents a summary of research undertaken in Europe, the U.S.A., and eastern Canada of four significant industrialized building systems. The findings of a market analysis, an examination  of local manufacturing capabilities, and comments on the building codes and the need for a locally sponsored building system comprise part two. A summary of conclusions and recommendations and their rationale is set out in part three. Appendixes contain school construction costs and cost estimates, an analysis of construction types, and comments of the Metropolitan Toronto School Board Study of Educational Facilities progress to date with implications for a system building program in British Columbia.

As the focal point of the investigation, a junior high school population (grades 7-9) was selected. The junior high years represent a critical period in the education of remedial students -- those with low IQs, those who have failed several grades, or those who are unable to perform high school work. Most States permit students of 14-16 years to drop out of school. This age group corresponds to the junior high school level. Having dropped out, people with poor junior high school educations have great difficulty finding work, and many of these dropouts turn to unemployment, welfare, or crime. The author uses a model to show that by  reducing the number of dropouts and by providing better education, the community burden of supporting these people may be decreased. (Author)",

Found space is one solution to the problem of providing needed school space despite an inability to raise money to build new schools. Many school systems are exploring economical alternative solutions to the school space problem that would provide new or modernized old space at a reduced cost, more space or better space for the same amount of money, greater use out of existing space, and less expensive alternatives to conventional school space.

Statistical procedures included varimax and maxplane factor analysis and Cronbach's item analysis. Six stable factors composed of 56 items with reliabilities ranging from .73-.83 were isolated. Finally, the theoretical basis and similar psychometric properties in different organizational types are indicative of versatility for probing many provocative relationships related to work motivation.

The program focuses on organizational planning in two State educational agencies and involves the sequential implementation of three distinct, offsite, residential training efforts. The first of these, the Management Course for Presidents (MCP), was attended by the State Superintendent. The second program, Top Management Briefing (TMB), was administered to the top 24 administrators from the State agency and the 24 top administrators from pilot, local education agencies. The third program, the Educational Planning Process, was administered to organizational teams primarily composed of persons who attended the TMB. Analysis of interview and  questionnaire data revealed that the training program did not change attitudes toward management and planning, and that some positive training effects occurred in role relationships and group standards. In addition, the organization that showed some effects or changes attributable to training was also consistently lower on all of the measurement variables than either the other Experimental State or the Control.

Over a 20-year period, the gradual shift in the relative power of the parties produced a relationship from which at least some elements of conflict had been removed. Three time periods are discussed. At first, the behavior of the school board toward teachers was characterized by exclusion of the teachers from the decisionmaking process. Subsequently, the power differential declined, the teachers began to mobilize their collective power effectively, and forced the board to make concessions to which it would never before have consented. Finally, in the power differential elimination period, the  union, first by a strike and then by association, and by issuing sanctions, demonstrated its willingness to disrupt the school system to achieve a share in the board's education decisionmaking. The implications of this research for boards of education and teachers are presented. (Author/JF)",

Children of low SES status are seen to show the greatest discrepancy between non-academic abilities and their low IQs. Two broad types of mental ability are delineated: Level I, the non-academic skills (non-transformational learning and retention), and Level II, the academic (intelligence, i.e., analytic understanding, reasoning, abstraction, conceptual thinking). Level II includes the  processes generally measured by intelligence tests. Retarded low SES children are found to be superior in Level I ability to middle SES children of similar IQ. Level I and II abilities in the general population are analyzed, as are the nature of the relationship between the Levels, and the physiological basis of Level I and II abilities. (KW)",

The plight of the poor, the  handicapped, and the minority groups is considered with the suggestion that professional educators should be willing to develop enough strategies so that no child will be excluded from the system.

Subjects were 48 normals (IQ 90-110) and 48 retardates (IQ 50-75), all CA 8-20 years. A battery of assessments, including conservation, spatial imagery, and memory tasks, was presented on three recall occasions. The first time, an arrangement of geometric shapes was shown to subjects, who were then asked to draw the configuration from memory. One week and 6 months later, subjects were asked to draw from memory then reconstruct from a random assortment the configuration. While normals performed better on all recall occasions, over 6 months the rate of decrement on both memory assessments  (reconstruction and evocation) was the same for both groups, suggesting that a short term memory deficit evidenced in immediate recall is the major differentiator between normals and retardates. Analysis also indicated that both Piagetian measures of reasoning and standard measures of intelligence (WISC or WAIS) added to the prediction of memory, with the Piagetian reasoning measures the most efficient predictors.

At the end of the year, preliminary followup consisted of classification of the students by their teachers into High Risk and Low Risk criterion groups for potential learning disability (the true criterion would be third grade reading achievement scores). Purpose of the classification by teachers was to obtain preliminary criterion estimates of subsequent learning disability in order to determine the predictive validity of  the independent variables (the tests administered earlier). Results showed high concordance between predictor measures (tests) and teacher classifications: tests correctly classified 78.4% of the children classified as High Risk, and 82.7% of the Low Risk children, suggesting that correct identification can occur even before formal reading instruction.

Helping a child learn to utilize incoming information efficiently is seen as a problem of management. The processing of auditory information is briefly considered in the determination of what is entailed in the management of learning processes. Educators of the deaf are advised to evaluate each part of the mediating process which occurs between stimuli reception and subsequent behavior to insure that no obstacles to learning remain unidentified. It is said that the answer to the question of why a child cannot hear must consider such aspects of perception as a signal reception, signal analysis and acceptance, signal retention, signal synthesis and  integration, and signal convergence and divergence. After this attention to auditory processing, appropriate rehabilitative educational programs can then be developed. (KW)",

Half of the subjects were tested under conventional group procedures, and half under computer-managed conditions. Both groups were retested 12-28 days later under computer-managed conditions. Three major objectives were to determine: if performance was affected by mode of presentation; whether, under untimed conditions, time required to complete the test varied under the two conditions; and the coefficient of stability of the RPMT. Mode of presentation was found to be  unrelated either to student performance of time taken to complete test, demonstrating that use of computers in testing does not affect test results and establishing the feasibility of using computers to administer, score, and report selected standardized tests. Evaluation of the RPMT showed it to be a useful backup test but not reliable enough a test on which to exclusively base educational decisions. (KW)",

Extent and type of services used were related slightly to type of course, and more so to receptive communication skills and grades received. No specific conclusions were drawn. (KW)",

The first study was a pilot study dealing with the deaf student's ability to identify structural units in written language. The second two studies, concerning the cloze procedure, examined the technique as a possible adjunct to a battery of language assessment instruments and assessed its usefulness as an instructional tool for possible incorporation in remedial language programs. Conclusions were that syntax recognition was too simplistic an approach to assessing linguistic ability of the students, and that the cloze technique, while more inclusive, was too general an indicator of overall language proficiency. Cloze was seen  as a useful adjunct to, but not replacement for, a battery of tests for assessing language skills of deaf students. As an instructional technique, it was concluded that use of cloze should be left to the discretion of the teacher and tailored to the student's needs as interpreted by the teacher. (KW)",

The tests developed were said to meet objectives of both the classroom teacher and the developmental psychologist. A test battery was devised for the 3 to 8-year-old range with modification in the selection procedure of the tests to account for developmental change. The CREED 3 test battery measured gross motor coordination, sensory motor behavior, visual analysis, attention and memory, and conceptualization. The population tested included 444 3 to 4-year-olds, 227 5 to  8-year-olds, and 289 7 to 8-year-olds, all of whom were deaf children in the New York State schools for the deaf. Results showed that the test battery differentiated successfully among those deaf children with and without learning disabilities. Significant differences in performance on subtests in all five areas were found for each of the three age groups. Evidence also suggested that the test battery described differences within the typical and special groups as a function of age. (For related documents, see also EC 041 647, EC 041 649-50.) (CB)",

The earlier studies are summarized briefly to explain the history and foundation for the CREED 5 Curriculum. The primary goal of the overall project is stated to be development of cognitive processes in the child; the curriculum content is described as perceptual and cognitive. At each developmental level, the curriculum was subjected to evaluation by teachers and supervisors from 12 schools for the deaf in New York State. The curriculum focuses on five instructional areas of gross motor  coordination, sensory motor integration, visual analysis, attention and memory, and conceptualization. Implementation of the curriculum, viewed as comprehensive and developmental, is based on paraprofessional involvement, continual program evaluation, and individualized instruction. Involvement of a representative group of supervisors and teachers in a series of ongoing seminars as part of the curriculum development was reviewed to highlight teacher role in each stage of the curriculum development.

This relatedness exists at a very deep conceptual level and its practical everyday social and educational implications have hardly begun to be realized (in the sense of being made real). Technology is the sum total of those activities which, in the aggregate, enable man to carry out almost any imaginable manipulation or modification of his external (material) or internal (behavioral) environments. The relationship of technology and education is, today, so close that in many parts of the world educational institutions are in the process of becoming little more than handmaidens of a demanding, world-wide technological master. To the  extent that this tendency grows, we are faced with a closed technological-educational system whose success is not measured in terms of how it serves human need, but rather in terms of the system as an end in itself. However, the development and use of media of communications has also made information immediately available to the individual at his option. It is thus possible to restructure the educational system to make technology serve human needs, and this restructuring may best be carried out by those who have \"opted out\" of traditional education.

The paper does not suggest a new theoretical model to examine the problems of peace, but rather shows the relevance of an existing device to many such inquiries. In demonstrating this relevance, peace is treated as an ecological  problem because of the high tolerance of the ecological approach to complexity of the order detected in the psycho-social system.

Computers have three basic uses in teaching, to compute, to instruct, and to motivate; effective computer languages should be responsive to these three modes. Widely-used languages, including FORTRAN, ALGOL, PL/1, and APL, are compared. The decline of FORTRAN as the most widely used language is predicted. Various conversational forms of languages are compared, and criteria are set forward for terminal languages. These criteria include ease in learning, editing facilities, attitudes toward subroutines, dialog writing, string manipulating facilities, array and matrix capability and others. (RB)",

An aggregative model of the economy was constructed and programed for a computer and (hypothetical) historical data were generated. The data were then given to students so that they could attempt to make policy decisions which would solve problems of unemployment and inflation in the economy. Variants of the model were used in a number of ways during the past several years--for students in an introductory economics course, for an intermediate macroeconomics course, and for first-year graduate theory students. At the graduate level, a stochastic version of the model has  been used with a regression package, and this modification appears to provide an ideal laboratory for the exploration of econometric problems. Most students who have been exposed to the model report that they enjoyed participating in the game and as a result became more interested in their course and that the experience had made the textbook material seem more real and more easily understood.

The results of the study suggest that various physical, content, and organizational characteristics of the televised teacher communiques and teacher manuals used with elementary school level instructional  television series are positively evaluated by teachers; that significant student learning results from instructional television; that increased student learning is a function of the nature of teacher self-preparatory activity; that teachers do not engage in a high frequency of pre- or post-telelesson activity with their students; and that in general, exposure to two teacher aids is more influential than a single aid.

Should all these forces prevail, the consequence would require a radical reassessment of all aspects of national policy, but particularly in the areas of research funding policy and educational policy. The world macroproblem is the composite of all the problems which have come with technology application and industrial development. The problem is exacerbated by the reductionistic,  deterministic premises of the predominating behavioral-science and sociopolitical theory found in the universities which train the society's leaders. Such premises are in conflict with the basic premises of a democracy: that man is, by virtue of his transcendental nature, endowed with reason, will, and a valid sense of value.

The new science will take  these features into account. By doing so, it may ennoble the image of the individual's possibilities, of the educational and socializing processes, and of the future.

It is important to train today's children in visual literacy because the mass media are more vital to them and take up more of their time than do the schools. As part of a pilot project designed to deal with the problems of reading and verbal-visual communication, a group of elementary school students were provided with cameras and films and, after some training in their use, were sent out to take pictures. The resulting pictures revealed the interests of the students. The second step was having students take photo sequences centering around a theme of their own choosing. The results showed whether the students were able to understand cause and effect and first and last. The themes chosen were used as the  basis for group and individual conferences. The next step was to make movies. A natural outgrowth of the movie project was the use of closed-circuit video tape equipment. The instant playback of this equipment proved valuable in showing whether students could correct errors as they went along. (JK)",

However, there are certain technical problems with achieving interscorer reliability which may act as a deterrent to the widespread use of the tests. A thorough review of the literature has revealed that computerized content analysis has not been used for scoring creativity tests, although it appears to be an appropriate approach. Therefore, a study was devised to develop strategies appropriate to computer scoring of the TTCT, to determine the effectiveness of actuarial measures in the prediction of scores, and to make some initial explorations regarding the  appropriateness of the norms developed by Torrance for scoring the tests. Responses of 153 subjects to Verbal Form A of the tests were reliably rated by four trained judges, and multiple correlation analyses were computed. The regression equations generated through this process were shown to have high predictive power, and examination of the important predictors suggested that the TTCT has a single underlying dimension of verbal fluency. Category count variables were useful in the prediction process. (Author/SH)",

And finally, the importance of television as a  principal socializing agent for children as pointed out in the Report is suggested as an area where the television industry can take the initiative and imaginatively produce programs to upgrade the cultural environment.

While the method of selection and the final composition of the Scientific Advisory Committee might have favored the networks, it is significant that a unanimous report was filed. It is important to emphasize at this point that &quot;no action&quot; in this social area is a form of action: it is an acquiesence in the continuation of the present level of televised violence entering American homes. The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare stands ready to assist those concerned with  television programming by providing scientific information and advice, and the Federal Communications Commission, members of the academic community, other legislators, and members of the broadcasting industry will have suggestions for reducing televised violence and including more programming designed to induce prosocial behavior. The Committee's report, then, represents a step forward and should provide a stimulus to other social scientists to build on the solid foundation which has now been erected.

The National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence concluded in 1969 that violence on television encourages real violence, especially among the children of poor, disorganized families. The report of the Scientific Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General concerning past studies and the five volumes of commissioned research on television and social behavior makes a major contribution to understanding the role of television in influencing the social behavior of children. The report and its underlying research make clear that there is evidence to support the hypothesis that the viewing of violence on  television can lead to antisocial behavior. This is particularly disturbing because violence figures so prominently in television entertainment. While it is clearly beyond dispute that a reduction in the violent content of television is most desirable, it is not our place to suggest means for achieving this. However, we are carefully analyzing the report to identify additional follow-up study areas so that we can broaden our base of knowledge.

Further, the FCC plans public panel discussions and oral argument before the Commission which will address every facet of our broadcasting system, especially its capability for serving young viewers. The FCC believes that the response of the broadcasting industry to the Surgeon General's report should be immediate, and should include the reduction of all gratuitous violence in  children's programming and the creation of new and diversified programming designed to open the eyes and expand the minds of children. At least on paper, the Television Code of the National Association of Broadcasters makes many relevant points. To implement the need for new programming, cooperation and consultation among the networks, broadcasters, and advertisers will be required.

        "description":"The Surgeon General has stated that the time is here for action, and that the data is sufficient to justify actions. A clear and present danger of the effects of televised violence on children has been demonstrated to us all. The Foundation To Improve Television is presently before the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with a Petition for Rule-Making to have the FCC add a section on violence and horror television (TV) programs curtailing such programs during typical children viewing hours. Despite the First Amendment to the Constitution, the FCC has the authority and the responsibility to regulate the amount of violence and horror portrayed on TV because of its duty to act in the public interest and protect public health. There is sufficient evidence now to support the  finding that the portrayal of excessive violence on TV is inimical to the mental health of our children. Television has immense potential for reaching children, and the Foundation will continue to encourage positive programing while fighting broadcasting that is harmful to children. (SH)",

A questionnaire was sent to random samples of parents with three to five year old children in three groups: those children who saw the program every day, children who watched the program eah day and were visited once a week by a paraprofessional home visitor, and children who watched the program, were visited once a week by the home visitor, and were exposed to a mobile classroom once a week. Results showed that &quot;Around the Bend&quot; was rated as good or better than two popular children's programs on commercial television and &quot;Sesame Street.&quot; The highest rating was given the program on every  question and by every treatment group. It was somewhat surprising that &quot;Around the Bend&quot; should have received consistently higher ratings than &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, since &quot;Around the Bend&quot; is a black and white 30-minute program. However, &quot;Around the Bend&quot; had been available in the community longer, and was probably perceived as more relevant to the Appalachian area. (SH)",

        "description":"Project 5 of the GUME study on foreign language teaching methods continues the work of the previous projects concerning the relative effectiveness of a habit-formation (implicit) method and a cognitive-code learning method, with explanations in either the source or target language. The educational problem of Project 5 is teaching the English passive voice to Swedish students in Class 8. The teaching procedures and design differ slightly from the first three projects. The time for explanations varies between the source-language and target-language methods. The source-language method uses comparisons with corresponding structures in the source language where applicable. No significant differences in the learning effects of the three methods are evidenced; interesting trends,  however, are noted and discussed. This report presents details on project design, lessons, and evaluation instruments. A statistical description of the experimental population is provided along with a statistical analysis of the results and a correlation study of the variable factors. A discussion of the results and their implications follows.

The first paper deals with a number of problems that arise in conjunction with the necessary, allowed, or disallowed coreferentiality of a complement sentence subject with some noun-phrase in a higher sentence. The author seeks to prove that the machanism involved, generally stated to be governed by verbs, is indeed a subject-subject constraint applicable to a rather natural verb-class. Previous theories are discussed, and the relevant generative-semantic assumptions for the present theory are provided. The hypothesis of the second paper is that, in English, agents are just deep subjects. If a noun phrase is the agent of a sentence, then it is the subject of that sentence in the  underlying structure. Terms are defined and the theory is explained.

The four main areas of such a cultural study are family, language, customs, and community structure. Typical subtopics include the city and village, architectural styles, clothing (traditional and modern), folk art, music, dance and song, customs and holidays, menus, children's rhymes, and proverbs and  jokes. By pursuing cultural study in this manner, the teacher will impart to his students an awareness of the German life-style and character as well as a knowledge of the language itself.

These books should be helpful in teaching English, reading, social studies, and other disciplines. Each annotation lists the tribe involved in the story and the suggested grade level. An index arranged by tribe name lists works that concern each particular group. (Author/VM)",

        "description":"The problem of teaching standard English reading and language skills to children who speak nonstandard dialects can be facilitated through a language program that distinguishes between \"everyday talk\" and \"school talk,\" while recognizing the position of both types of speech. The instructional materials must be meaningful with respect to the experiential background of the learner. At no time during the learning situation should the child be given the impression that his basic, established speech patterns are inferior speech. In this particular language program, verb usage constitutes the area of distinction between the two types of language, and the instructional procedures and practices described here emphasizes those differences. Research indicates that if the children's  established speech forms are accepted as legitimate forms of communication while those speech forms used in school by the teacher and observed in the books are systematically introduced, the children readily accept and enjoy learning the speech forms traditionally fostered by the school.

        "description":"The experiment described in this report investigates two basic questions concerning beginning reading instruction to speakers of nonstandard dialects. 1--Will learning to read be facilitated if the primary reading material is phrased in the actual word patterns and grammatical structure used by the children in their oral speech? 2--Will learning the same story rephrased in speech patterns corresponding to standard English usage be facilitated if the children first learn to read the story phrased in the word patterns and grammatical structure corresponding to their oral speech? Using the concepts of \"everyday talk\" and \"school talk\" with special emphasis on the verb-usage differences between the two, an experimental class was conducted with the above questions in mind. Results of  tests administered to the experimental group and the control group show that there is a definite trend in favor of the experimental group. The experimental reading program encourages the teacher to respect and accept the children's established dialect while at the same time providing a framework to help the children learn to read, gradually and systematically using standard English in their oral language activities.

Students from the elementary, junior high, and college levels are tested after receiving identical instruction in German phonemes. Post-test results indicate that both the junior high and college groups are superior to the elementary age group. There is good evidence that the age-language acquisition relationships favoring younger students hold for first languages only. The common observation that children acquire better language pronunciation than adults may have an environmental-socioeconomic explanation and depend on the differences in the way each group is able to acquire the second language. It  is more probable that children would have a closer approximation to native-like pronunciation because they are surrounded by good models more of the time than their adult counterparts.

Many researchers have suggested that the consonant-vowel (CV) syllable may be a universal unit of speech production and perception, while language units become criterial only at higher levels of processing. In second language learning, the language units and speech units may interfere with one another and produce a disorganized type of speech rhythm. Even before grammar rules and language units are introduced, it would seem profitable to introduce students to the syllabic patterning and rhythmic structure of the target language and to teach them to imitate orally the sounds and rhythms of the target language before they understand the meaning of the  utterances.

The program suggested presents nine units, each one on the study of a particular culture. The cultures to be studied represent a wide variety of types selected for diversity in population size, language, subsistence, race, climate, and geography. The life of the child is considered in each culture. Each culture is studied objectively as an entity, without reference to or measurement against  a master culture. Unit 10 provides a chance for the child to see differences and similarities among the cultures by classifying the children from the nine cultures in terms of the way they live. Different classification criteria produce various groupings, underlining a variety of differences and similarities. (VM)",

The author discusses practical problems and provides examples from his own family situation in which his children learned French, English, and German. The possibility of language mixture is discussed and the author presents some tentative conclusions about the usage of a particular language in a particular situation. If the situation is a natural one, it is likely to motivate the child to use the language of the situation. If the parents do not interfere or force the child to speak a given language in a given situation, the overall linguistic development of the child is likely to be normal. If the parents inconspicuously lead the child into natural contexts in which the probability of  language switch is high, the full language learning potential of the situation will have its effect upon the children.

In North India, according to adult informants, Hindi is spoken at school, in formal business contacts or government offices, in formal ceremonies; it is the written language. Bhojpuri is the language spoken at home and in more informal relationships. Dialect in India is defined by attitudes, vested interests, and cognitive assumptions as to the nature of ritual, social and linguistic context, and kinesic and paralinguistic markers. Studying a child's development in the recognition and use of the language styles and dialects indicates some of the learning processes that are involved. It  is possible to see various stages in the language development of children as they learn the proper usage of the styles and dialects. (VM)",

He would then attack the written material, forming hypotheses, building models, and discovering the code of the written language--its morphemic, syntactic, and semantic systems.

The procedures and techniques for the experiment are described and preliminary findings are discussed. Children practice language by repeating an utterance several times, first single words and later whole sentences. Imitation plays a great part in linguistic development. The most advanced children have parents who talk a great deal with (not to) their children and who listen to them, trying to understand what they say. These parents often \"translate\" (not correct) and develop what their children say in order to check that they are on line with each other. Such translations or\"imitations with expansion\" made by the parent seem to be of great importance to strenghthen the right structural patterns. (Author/VM)",

Children learning two languages simultaneously demonstrate processes at work in code-switching and language development.

From a study of the results achieved over a ten-year period, it would seem that, if at least one of the languages of the pre-school child is secure as a medium of communication, free language alternation in early childhood education can be used with mixed language populations as a means to promote bilingualism in the kindergarten and primary grades.

An ongoing, 10-year, language experiment (1964-74) involving 18,000 students ranging in age from 8 to 13, concentrates on determining the desirability and practicability of starting modern language programs in the elementary schools of England. Principal objectives of the experiment examined in this report include: (1) evaluation of the effect of the introduction of French at the primary level on achievement in other areas of the curriculum, (2) assessment over a period of years of the level of achievement in French of the pupils involved in the experiment, (3) evaluation of the influence of socio-economic and attitudinal factors on the  acquisition of a second language, and (4) investigation of the organizational and pedagogical problems posed by the introduction of second-language teaching at the primary school.

Various tests of reading skill are discussed and correlations with other tests are given.

This paper reports the results of a study that explores the effects of sentence length and grammatical structure on the ability of foreign students to repeat English sentences. It was hypothesized that sentences of the same length but with different syntactic structures would not be equally easy to repeat. The results show that repeatability of sentences depends on the syntactic structure of the sentences, as measured by type of sentence expansion and sentence pattern, as well as on the number of words in the sentence. The results also indicate that as sentences become longer the effect of the structure becomes more pronounced. In constructing drill  sentences for foreign language learners, sentence pattern, type of sentence expansion, and sentence length should all be considered of prime importance. (Author)",

The dissertation describes a \"natural\" transition to English with no formal instruction in English being given the child. It is believed that examination of problems encountered by the child on making the linguistic transition, conclusions of the study, and suggestions concerning the learning process will be helpful to elementary school teachers of English as a second or third language.

Chapter 4 deals with changes in the distribution of students by field of study, Chapter 5 examines the patterns of growth in number of degrees  awarded, and in Chapter 6 the problems of the performance of the system are considered in an analysis of changes in length of study and in the relation between numbers of new entrants and numbers of graduates. Finally, in Chapter 7, past forecasts of enrollments and of breakdown by field of study are compared with actual developments. A straightforward extrapolation of trends up to 1965 are used as a basis for a projection of enrollments up to 1980. (Author/HS)",

This study was made to determine tha chances of survival for such probationary students, and to find which student characteristics are related to survival. Sex, ACT tests, college of first entrance, and year of birth were found not to be significantly related to academic survival. High school class size was highly predictive of success in clearing probation, with students from class size 51-100 most likely to clear probation, and  students from class size 101-250 least likely. The GPR for the first semester in school was also an important indicator. Only about 6% of the students with GPR below 1.00 for the first semester were able to clear probation in 3 semesters. The percentage improved to 26.8% for those whose first semester GPR was 1.40 to 1.59. (HS)",

There are a number of factors which indicate that the D.A. degree will be successful in the future: (1) the endorsement of the D.A. degree by a large number of professional organizations; (2) the relatively large number of universities  offering, planning to offer, or considering the possibility of offering the D.A. degree; (3) the increasing need for junior college and college instructors who are specifically prepared to teach; and (4) the increasing interest of graduate students in teaching and working with college-age students rather than becoming research specialists. A description of the Ball State University D.A. program in the field of music is included in the paper. (HS)",

The administrators and new teachers discussed such matters as typical problems of instruction in their institutions, the particular needs of students, experimental programs and innovations in American colleges and universities, the distribution and redistribution of power on the college campus, the effects of social changes on colleges, students as prime innovators, decisionmaking, the role of the faculty, and the relationships among students, faculty and administration. It is felt that the conference served as a point of entry and a natural springboard for  the RELCV involvement with these and other major problems related to instructional, faculty and curricular improvement.

Furthermore, a teacher can help a student improve his self-evaluation over a period of time if the teacher takes into consideration aspects of the student's personality. The purpose of this study was to determine: (1) if a student's estimate of his academic performance was more accurate initially than at points halfway through and at the end of the term; (2) if age, sex, quality point average, grade received, or personality variables, as measured by the 16 Personality Factor Questionnaire, would differ significantly among the students who accurately estimated from those who either overestimated or underestimated their final grade in a course; and (3) if  there were differences for these variables between the 3 groups of students in the fields of education, engineering, and business. The findings of the study were in opposition to previous studies. They show that: (1) students were best able to evaluate their performance at the beginning of the term; (2) there was little difference between high achieving and low achieving students in ability to predict their course grade, but older students proved more accurate than the younger students; and (3) none of the personality factors were found to be significant for over, under, and accurate estimators in any of their respective academic areas.

        "description":"From the earliest years of its existence, the Association of American Colleges has been concerned with the place of the church-related college in American society. The reason for this is simply the conviction that something very important would be lost in the total spectrum of higher education should these colleges pass out of existence. The growing movement toward secularization in the 50's and 60's, however, has given rise to uncertainty in many quarters as to the distinctiveness of the church-related college. Moreover, many have raised the question of whether these institutions serve the public good at all. It was with these questions in mind that the Association's Commission on Religion in Higher Education decided to hold a conference on the contribution of the church-related  college to the public good. Faculty, students, administrators, trustees, and church-board executives were invited to attend the conference, and approximately 50 persons convened for the 2-day session. This document contains the program of the conference and the issues discussed. Although the issues were not finally resolved by the conference, it is felt that a greater understanding of the alternatives for church-related higher education has been achieved. (HS)",

The first and third levels are already well established. The first level is comprised of 2-year community colleges and the third is comprised of those institutions offering graduate programs through the Ph.D. The second level is comprised of those institutions that offer only junior and senior year programs and limited graduate work. Such an institution is Florida International University (FIU), which will open its doors in the fall of 1972. From its inception, FIU has envisioned itself as a metropolitan-commuter university specifically designed to serve the needs of numerous  community college graduates who want to continue their college educations. This document provides data concerning the potential students at FIU, including information about socioeconomic status of the families and educational background. It is evident from the data that the demand for an institution of this type exists, and that the planned expansion of the University to other areas of the state probably will be feasible. (HS)",

In other words, statistics reveal that in 1968 there were 4.1 million students enrolled in metropolitan colleges and universities and that the cost at that time was approximately $8 billion; by 1990 enrollment is projected to reach 8.2 million and cost $24 billion. In examining this projection it was found that the results depended heavily on a number of basic assumptions: (1) there will be a large increase in the number of disadvantaged students--particularly urban blacks and Spanish Americans--enrolling in higher education; (2) an increasing number of married women will resume their  education after raising their families; (3) an increasing number of men and women employed full-time will continue for a large portion of their lives in organized educational programs; (4) a large number of technical and vocational programs will be upgraded to the college level; and (5) automation and mechanization will continue to reduce jobs available--a factor that will encourage many to stay in college.

The organization and operation of the Black Studies programs differ widely among the schools, and reasons for establishment of the programs range from the purely academic (the transmission of knowledge about the black experience) to a social action emphasis. It is concluded that none of the universities are planning full-scale programs for the near future. Three major reasons are cited for this: (1) there is a shortage of money and staff; (2)  intrauniversity conflict exists concerning availability of faculty; and (3) several directors noted that they face the task of convincing the other departments of the validity of Black Studies as an intellectual enterprise. All of the institutions expect gradual but steady program growth in the future. (HS)",

The paper takes into account the financial crunch in higher education, the financial burdens on students and families, and the 1971-72 higher education legislation. It is summarized that federal aid to higher education should be in such a form and such an amount as to: (1) maximize the resources available from state and local governments, students and parents, and productivity increases in higher education; (2) compensate for persisting inefficiencies in state support of higher education; (3) compensate for an inadequate state tax base; and (4) reflect truly national goals such as (a) increasing the  proportion of low income youth attending higher education, (b) supporting research, and (c) reducing state and regional disparities in available public services. In general, these guidelines suggest a form of federal support that would feature aid to students, institutions, states, educational programs, and categorical research. (Author/HS)",

The 6 recommendations of the Committee are: (1) occupational programs should continue to be offered by all types of postsecondary institutions; (2) proposals for establishing new, public, postsecondary institutions of all types should be reviewed by the Commission, which, in turn, should recommend  legislative authorization for all proposed institutions receiving favorable review; (3) expanded cooperation between higher education institutions and area vocational-technical schools located in the same or neighboring communities should continue to be encouraged; (4) the program review function of the Commission should be strengthened and should continue to include considerations of new and existing vocational and occupational education programs; (5) the Commission should review and make recommendations annually to the State Board for Vocational Education as related to postsecondary education; and (6) legislation should be enacted providing authorization for any area vocational-technical school to become a state institution upon petition and recommendation. The underlying rationale for  these proposals is explained in depth. (Author/HS)",

The conclusions of the Private College Study Panel indicate that private colleges have made impressive contributions to Minnesota and that their present programs provide the foundation for greater potential contributions in the future.

This report presents 7 case studies that review procedures followed by colleges or educational program directors in costing individual allied health occupation programs. The research was performed by the Cost Advisory Group of the Executive Committee of the Association of Schools of Allied Health Professions. The results of the explorations proved disappointing due to time limitations and a lack of resources. It was found, however, that the total expenditures for allied health educational programs at an academic institution depend on 2 factors: (1) the expenditures for particular curricula; and (2) the combination of curricula at that institution.  The problems associated with cost analysis are many, but they are not insoluble. They should be regarded as a challenge and voluntarily accepted as such. Because of the degree of expertise and involvement that are needed, it is recommended that cost study groups be established to work exclusively on this problem. (Author/HS)",

In the next section the principal Federal aid programs are discussed: Educational Opportunity Grants, College Work-Study, National Defense Student Loan, and Guaranteed Student Loan Programs. The  budget implications of the current programs are contrasted in the next section by computing the costs to the Federal government, state government, institution, and student. The next section discusses the economic implications of the loan and grant programs, and the final section describes what some of the economic consequences may be for the proposed National Student Loan Association. In the appendix formulas are derived that compute the present value of loan costs. (Author/HS)",

They are also of interest to prospective graduate students, vocational counselors, and others similarly concerned with financing higher education and with identifying career opportunities in universities. This report summarizes data submitted for fall 1970 by 3,071 doctorate science departments of 227 institutions applying for NSF traineeship grants for 1971. The data show that: (1) full-and parttime graduate enrollment declined 2% from 1969 to 1970, after increasing 3% during 1967-68 and 2% during 1968-69; (2) of the  146,000 graduate students enrolled full-time in 1970, 28% were supported by fellowships and traineeships, 27% were self-supported, 24% had teaching assistantships, and 21% had research assistantships; (3) the departments in the study were staffed with 58,000 faculty members of which 27% were in life sciences, 20% in engineering, 19% in the physical sciences, 17% in the social sciences, 10% in the mathematical sciences, and 6% in psychology; and (4) there were 8,900 postdoctoral appointments of which 42% were concentrated in the physical sciences and 41% were in the life sciences.

The purpose of this study is to assess the attitudes of white entering freshmen toward blacks at the University of Maryland. The Situational Attitude Scale (SAS) was administered to 470 white freshmen attending summer orientation. The results clearly indicate that white incoming freshmen have generally negative attitudes toward blacks. Combined with results of earlier studies on upperclassmen at the University, there is a clear negative attitude toward blacks among all whites studied. The implications of these findings for University planning and policymaking are discussed. These include at least one required course  in interracial and intercultural relations, seminars and race-related programs sponsored by academic and student affairs offices, as well as money for student and faculty initiated programs and race-related research programs. It is concluded that there is a great deal that can and should be done to minimize the potential for racial friction that exists on campus. (Author/HS)",

Institutions vary widely in the amount of self-inquiry they direct toward graduate work, and information collected over a wider area by standard methods has been difficult to come by. Several national studies conducted under the auspices of the American Council on Education, however, offer a useful means of making local and regional comparisons. When data are rearranged into regional or local subsets, the kind of relationships that are revealed give clues about the effects of past policy and future planning. This study collects and organizes the basic data from one such evaluation of graduate faculty to give  comparisons that have special significance for Pennsylvania. The collected information for the Commonwealth is compared with similar data for New York, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, and California and for the top-ranked schools in the study. The nature of the relationships between enrollment and ranking, the number of fields and ranking, and resident students enrolled and ranking make possible some rather clear observations about graduate education in the State.

The method used was a pretest-posttest design in which the experimental group of students were to fill out a value-preference inventory that yielded a score, sorting the students into 2 groups: those preferring mediated experiences and those preferring direct experiences. Following the pretest, the group leader pointed out to all of the students that those preferring direct experiences could not also favor drugs because drugs themselves are mediators. A discussion of this theory followed and more than 80% of the students agreed. The results show that students who preferred direct experiences and who were made to feel  dissonant about holding liberal drug views, showed considerably more conservatism in their attitudes toward drugs than similar students who had not been exposed to the experimental treatment. On the other hand, students who preferred mediated experiences and who were thus not made to feel dissonant during the experimental treatment, presented essentially the same attitudinal posture as similar students in the control group.

The curriculum, established in the fall of 1969, is based upon the premise that by giving freshmen more freedom and responsibility, along with the opportunity for more individual faculty guidance, a college can create an atmosphere in which both academic inquiry and personal growth will flourish. The curriculum consists of 3 components: the Freshman Institute, the Freshman Colloquia, and the Twentieth Century and Its Roots Course. The content of the focus of the 2-week Freshman Institute was on language and effective communication. It is felt that the Institute was successful in increasing student emphasis on responsible and articulate expression. The freshman Colloquia, also judged  quite valuable, consisted of small groups of 10-12 students with a faculty advisor. This component continued the emphasis on the personal dimension of education by improving communication skills, dealing seriously with academic topics, and by exposing the students to humane, moral, and aesthetic concerns. The final component of the freshman program, the &quot;Twentieth Century and Its Roots Course,&quot; was only moderately well received-in it students examined the major issues of modern society from many perspectives. Although this course was not as well attended as expected, it is hoped that it will gain greater student interest in subsequent semesters. (HS)",

Part of the reason for this is the expansion of public colleges and universities that can afford to offer an education at a lower price. Private higher education, it is argued in this paper, does provide a valuable service to the general public, and it would be highly beneficial to the states to provide support to these institutions. This document presents the results of a survey that was designed to solicit information concerning the amount and type of support presently being offered to private institutions by their states. It was found that 34 of the 50 states have programs  that support independent institutions or their students. However, this count excludes tax support, guaranteed student loan plans, and contractual arrangements for out-of-state student places. Should these 3 types be included, the count would be raised to 100%.

These principles embrace the concepts of: (1) the academy as a community in which all persons, teachers, and students are educators, and in which some authority is shared among the varying constituent groups; (2) the delegation of responsibility to the key officers within the college as well as the committees and councils that participate in governance; (3) the granting  of authority commensurate with the delegated responsibilities; (4) the insistence on accountability of all officers within the college, including the chief executive; and (5) the development of strategies for promoting effective change within the institution.

Results varied among the students surveyed. It was found that students at Central U. held a much more positive attitude toward open admissions than students at other schools. The students at elitest schools tended to hold a  negative attitude along with those who had achieved high grades at the CUNY schools. Also, students from affluent backgrounds were more likely to feel that open admissions would lower the value of a degree. Black students and women tended to view open admissions positively. (HS)",

Generally, analysts only view the college environment from one point of view - that of the overall college environment. However, a variety of approaches is needed in order to accurately describe an environment with subenvironments that more often than not affect students more than the overall environment. Analysts are interested in the effects of college on students in 3 major areas: (1) student change, (2) student stability, and (3) student outcome. The following general approaches have been used to describe, measure, and classify colleges and their environments: (1) anthropological vignettes; (2) conventional  (nominal) typologies; (3) attributes of members; (4) demographic, near-demographic, physical, and related institutional characteristics; (5) social structural and social organizational dimensions; and (6) \"climate\" of the college.

The research was completed using both standardized and nonstandardized instruments administered to freshmen students enrolled in a required English course during the 1970 fall quarter at Kent State University. The results are reported in a series of 37 tables. Suggestions for further, broader research in the area are made to determine what criteria variables students use to evaluate  above-average teachers. (Author/HS)",

The results indicate that when women's interests are compared with those of other women, the resulting structure of interests is essentially the same as that found for men. In addition, when there are occupations that both men and women pursue, these occupations tend to fit in similar positions within the structure for both men and women. It is recommended that women be provided with this  information so they may be aware of the more diverse career options open to them than commonly available. (Author/HS)",

        "description":"This nationwide study was concerned with the relation of personality traits, classroom behavior, and student-teacher relationships to creativity in college teaching. Creative teachers were identified by Ph.D. students who had studied under the teachers and who nominated them as having had the most facilitating effect on their creative development, or as having had a significant inhibiting effect. The classroom behavior and student-teacher relations for a total of 671 teachers were described by nominating students, and 492 of these completed the 16 Personality Factor Questionnaire, the Ghiselli Self-Description Inventory, the Barron-Welsh Art Scale, and several biographical items. Results indicate introversion, dominance, and self-sufficiency to be associated with creativity.  Support was also provided for association of greater esthetic sensitivity and less adherence to social mores with creative teaching in psychology. Clear-cut behavioral patterns differentiate teachers who facilitate creative development from those who hinder it. Encouragement through individual contact is found to be the most important aspect of student-teacher relationships affecting creativity. The classroom was found to be of lesser importance.

Evidence is introduced that indicates existing planning models may not be justified on a basis of benefits derived versus their development and operating costs. A survey of models and ideas indicates that CAMPUS and WICHE's RRPM are the most promising points of departure for the development of a new planning model. The stability of the elements of an induced-course-load matrix (ICLM), the core of both CAMPUS and RRPM, is examined using data from a large urban university. This examination is conducted on several levels of aggregation. In general, the ICLM is found to be viable as a basis for a planning model, assuming the model is  flexible enough to allow the appropriate level of aggregation. Proposals are advanced for the implementation of a planning model. Major reliance on WICHE's development and documentation of the RRPM model is suggested. (Author/HS)",

Two of the dominant models of university governance, the bureaucratic and the collegial, are examined and criticized, and a new political model is offered as an alternative means of understanding the dynamics of policymaking in academic organizations. In summary, the broad outline of the university's political system looks like this: there is a complex social structure that generates conflict; there are many forms of power and pressure that affect the decisionmakers; there is a legislative stage in which these pressures are translated into policy; and there  is a policy execution phase that eventually generates feedback with the potential for new conflicts. This political model has now been used in 3 empirical studies at New York University, Portland State College, and Stanford University, and a brief description of these studies is included.

The authors argue that political frameworks are necessary to understanding the dynamics of interest group activities that are directed toward influencing policy. Using the political framework, a number of propositions are advanced concerning interest group activities, the political motivations of partisan groups, the social control activities of authorities, and the cycle that the conflict goes through. A case study of a student conflict at Stanford University is used to give plausible support to the propositions. Although such a case study is in no sense proof of the propositions, it nevertheless clarifies issues and helps locate weaknesses and strengths in the theoretical  framework. (Author/HS)",

Four religious groups, 5 political groups, 10 sororities and 10 fraternities were chosen to represent a range of groups within each of the types. The study was undertaken to determine (1) the impact of formal student organizations on their membership, (2) the diversity and similarity of group characteristics, (3) the recruitment process into these groups, and (4) the relations between the groups and the larger university. The study documents the variability among student organizations across types and within types. Attempts to understand the basis of similarities and differences among groups led to 2 major sets of findings: (1) groups develop different ways of integrating their  members based on values, on the one hand, and affective ties on the other; and (2) groups' internal processes are connected with their relationships with the larger university. Bringing these 2 themes together, the study shows that value integration inside groups is related to a high sense of value difference with the university. Affective integration is related to interaction with other parts of the university. (Author)",

No significant changes in writing ability were detected in this study through a comparison of pre- and post-means for the total sample, or for any of the three colleges, as indicated by a t-test for correlated samples. An analysis of the individual score changes indicated that almost all student scores changed slightly during the semester. In essence, this study supports the use of a cooperatively developed scoring  key to reduce rater bias.

The college budget should be goal-oriented and the basis for a good management system. When properly used as a planning technique, the budget can become a vehicle for considering and sorting out alternative paths of action. The effectiveness of a budgeting sytem, however, is directly related to the attitudes of all persons involved; attitudes must be positive if positive results are to be obtained. Active participation at all levels also enhances effective control which will assist in the attainment of shared goals. One widely used budgeting plan, the Planning Programming Budgeting System (PPBS), is discussed in terms  of its advantages and disadvantages as a planning tool. The author concludes by citing the experience of her school district in implementing PPBS and other planning efforts to more efficiently and effectively make use of limited resources. (Author/AL)",

The traditional view that only private institutions are and can be innovative must be altered since: (1) the line dividing public and private institutions is becoming increasingly blurred; (2) the record of private colleges bringing about innovative educational change is spotty; and (3) the private colleges serve a dwindling percent of the total population and only institutions forced to deal with large numbers can be expected to explore new methods of education. The community college, still new enough to be flexible, more readily reaches populations who have encountered barriers to  traditional education and are, therefore, interested in non-traditional study. Other aspects of the community college conducive to non-traditional study are the lack of time limits on degrees and courses and its experience in counseling a wide variety of students.

In an age when knowledge is power, American higher education has not made knowledge as freely available or as usable as is necessary. Further, campus governance has permitted and supported great inequalities--untenured faculty have little or no say in policy decisions and curriculum revision and the self-interest of faculty has led to poorer quality education as demonstrated when the least experienced faculty teach the largest freshmen classes. The result is a gap between the teachers and the taught. Another factor contributing to the distrust of higher education by youth is the unreality of the campus; the students' experiences  and knowledge--especially of minority and poverty students--are ignored by faculty. Campuses continue to be segregated from urban problems at a time when the idea of creating isolated campuses is no longer tenable.

The vocational educator, however, must be aware of the restrictive rules and regulations imposed by external agencies responsible for administering some vocational programs. These conditions are based on the assumption that a vocational education program will be effective if the institution conforms to certain facility specifications or qualifications required of the teaching staff, instead of evaluating the competencies of the graduates themselves. There are indications of a trend in the approach to  institutional evaluation for accrediting purposes that emphasizes the quality of the product over the requirements of the process.

The primary aspect of the self-evaluation process consists of a faculty interviewing committee to question instructors about each of the above named areas. Instructors will present to the  committee teaching objectives, test scores, student rating forms, and a resume of school, community, and professional activities. A yearly file on each instructor, developed from the interviews, would be reviewed at each evaluation meeting.

Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia were represented by 200 conference registrants. Designed primarily for institutions having few or no programs for academically disadvantaged students, the conference covered each segment of the special service program--reading and writing laboratories and a learning resources center--offered at the host institution. Sessions were also conducted to illustrate developmental mathematics and experimental testing and guidance programs. Three decisions were made at the conclusion of the conference: (1) there should be a follow-up conference, (2) a national center for data about programs for the disadvantaged should be established, and (3)  there should be a permanent association concerned with assisting high risk students. Also included in these proceedings are a summary of responses to a questionnaire by participating registrants and discussions on: (1) the need for commitment to high risk education, (2) communication difficulties encountered by the educationally disadvantaged, (3) problems surrounding financing instructional hardware and other grantsmanship concerns, and (4) program planning requirements.

The index is an analytical model based on the concept of socio-economic profiles, using small area 1970 census data, and is the primary means for evaluating recruitment efforts. The six steps for implementing the model are: (1) determine high school seniors' educational aspirations and home addresses; (2) assign appropriate census tract or census block numbers to the high school students' records; (3) add 1970 census data to the student file; (4) analyze data to determine items acting as predictors of educational aspiration; (5) assign educational aspiration scores  to all census tracts or blocks in the study area; and (6) validate the model using random testing procedures. The methodology associated with this model and the use of computer mapping as a means of presenting the results to a decision maker are discussed. (AL)",

Direct economic influences on the area include: (1) TCJC students spent more than $35 million a year on food, clothing, shelter, transportation, and entertainment; (2) full-time employees and spouses earned over $7.5 million of which at least 80% of the net was spent in the county; (3) architectural and construction firms in the county have been paid about $21 million by the college; and (4) TCJC annually spends about $1.5 million for goods and services to county manufacturing,  service, and sales organizations. Charts and tables detailing these and other direct economic influences are included. In addition, there are many indirect economic influences of the college such as providing the employment sector with better-trained people, however, such influences are only suggested by this study.

Sixty-seven faculty members in two community colleges who have had opportunities to use CAI were surveyed as to their agreement or disagreement with each assertion. The faculty responses showed widespread agreement with all 23 assertions with a few differences of opinion appearing between faculty members teaching technical and those teaching non-technical subjects. Comments made by the respondents suggest a need for data file access for CAI purposes and that alternative instructional systems may be more effective than CAI in realizing some of the assertions.

A second area of major importance for research concerns the impact of the community college on its students. Here, longitudinal studies of student attitudes, values and maturation levels are needed. The third area is the recreational activities and interests of community college students and of later adolescents generally; this would include all leisure time activities such as television viewing  and reading habits. Lastly, research is needed to cast light on the \"linkages\" between high schools and community colleges such as coordinated guidance and testing programs, and the impact of these linkage arrangements on students.

If the provision of quiet areas where readers can work undisturbed is an important criterion of library design, the traffic patterns generated in a library by the disposition of the various facilities - stacks, periodicals, reference books, catalogs, staff, browsing accommodation and areas for study - should be one of the main determinations of the layout. A reasonable reference from most existing layouts is that designers have been too concerned about the general appearance of the library and insufficiently concerned to isolate serious readers from the disturbance caused by all the other activities. With this in mind the authors present five alternative floor plans which  are designed to separate serious readers from the general flow of library traffic. (Author/SJ)",

An information network includes: (1) users, (2) information resources, (3) information centers, and (4) the total information transfer structure linking (1), (2), and (3). Emphasis is placed on the message transfer structure, as distinguished from the document transfer structure, to identify some basic network configurations. Any message transfer structure is shown in graph theory concepts to be either isographic or nonisographic. Among the isographic structures, the cyclic and decentralized networks are defined. The strictly hierarchical network is also defined, and the 2-regular network, reflected in  the ARPA design, is identified. Measures of network structure, in particular the accessibility and flexibility in message transfer, are developed. These measures for the basic structures are used to characterize more general structures. While some comparisons of message transfer structures can be made, development of more comprehensive measures is a necessity. (Author)",

Associating probabilities and costs with each of these decisions, we develop a Markovian model for the total network cost. The mean and variance of total cost are derived. Applicability of the model is discussed by considering the problems related to the estimation of necessary parameters.

The model consists of six subsystems (or blocks): logical processor, selector, descriptor, file, locator, document file, and analysis block. These subsystems function in a partial environment defined by the user and data blocks. Proceeding from a verbal description, a functional representation of each subsystem is developed. The functional representation describes not only what is done but also, to some degree, how tasks are accomplished within each subsystem. An immediate result of the functional representation is the definition of a metalanguage for identifying some necessary characteristics of higher level languages used in the implementation of information storage and retrieval systems.

        "description":"A study of the effects on public library circulation of putting a group of selected adult titles in a prime physical location is reported. It is hypothesized that public library circulation of these titles will be significantly greater when they are collected and placed in a prime location than when they are scattered on the shelves of even an open stack collection. The data for this study were collected over a 12 month period in the public libraries of Champaign and Urbana, Illinois. Phase one of the study (November 1, 1969, to April 30, 1970) was conducted simultaneously in both public libraries, and insofar as possible in the same manner. Phase two covered the six months from May 1, 1970, to October 31, 1970. The only intended difference between the two phases is that in phase  two the Champaign library placed all adult copies of the titles in question on a book display rack just inside the door of the library and near the circulation desk. The circulation of the selected books in Champaign was found to be markedly higher in phase two than what it was in phase one, or in either phase one or phase two in Urbana. (Author/NH)",

In order to emphasize the change in reading taste, and the corresponding change in writing fiction, the Oregon State Library sponsored a workshop dealing with book selection in this new era. Many communities in Oregon are conservative in their attitude toward appropriateness of materials in public libraries. This heightened the need to bring to the attention of librarians in small communities their role of leadership in cultural affairs and to develop a sense of responsibility to consider the &quot;problem&quot; book. The publication of the report of the President's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography made this an auspicious time to consider the problem. Much has been written on  censorship, intellectual freedom and librarians' responsibilities in these matters. Therefore, the emphasis of the workshop was on reading examples of current fiction and discussion of specific works on their merits in relation to the philosophical concepts that were generally known. An attempt was made to bring librarians attitudes toward the contemporary novel out into the open for criticism or justification. (Author)",

The definition or explanation of the library becomes more complex and the needed educational requirements of the school librarian have increased enormously. Requirements have been expanded to include knowledge in three basic fields: library science, professional education and audiovisuals -- yet at the same time highly specialized as to subject, level and type. One section of the paper includes certification requirements for school librarians as received from each State Department of  Education. Comparison of requirements in each state plus studies relating to past and present education of school librarians have produced several suggestions in the final section. Hopefully a unifying effect from the colleges and universities, national associations, and the State Departments of Education can achieve the highest standards available for tomorrow's school librarian-media specialist and audiovisual specialist.

Improved faculty orientation to the reserve collection, based on the findings of the 1960 survey, resulted in increased use of the reserve collection. This second evaluation concludes that despite increased usage, the present reserve system should be discontinued. Prohibitive operational costs, if directed instead toward alleviating the pressure on items in the general collection, would provide not only improved service for required class readings, but also improved service to the general clientele in placing fewer restrictions on  materials.

User behavior is explored in an attempt to solve the difficulties that arise in library planning and management, such as: (1) the relationship between length of loan period and &quot;idle time,&quot; (2) the availability of popular books and (3) the relationship between library usage and academic achievement. Fundamentally related to all this in a university library is the whole area of students' problem-solving behavior. It is clear that the serious study of policy-making and the allocation of resources in a university library must range widely over problems of human behavior and educational research.  Seen in this wider context it may be that the most useful contribution of this study is the way which, with further research, it may prove possible to quantitatively relate the day-to-day decisions of the librarian to the academic achievement of the university as a whole.

From January 1967 until June 1969 the Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) organized regular meetings under the title of Operational Studies Seminars to identify and describe in quantitative terms various factors which affect the operations of libraries especially university libraries. There were no formal records of these meetings, and after OSTI terminated its support, the University of Lancaster research team organized its own meetings and published the proceedings. The aim is to see how far it is possible to carry out mathematical modelling of  the operation of an academic library and its interactions with users, so that managerial decisions can be made on a rational rather than an institutional basis. The broad subject areas covered are: (1) Problems of library planning; (2) Techniques of analysis; (3) Data collection and evaluation; and (4) A review covering Library Management Research and Planning Library Services: an overview. This volume contains preprints of the papers presented and edited versions of the discussions. A list of participants is also included. This document previously announced as ED 045 173. (SG)",

The economic studies of information systems were extended along lines that refined the system models being used for study and that included consideration of networks of information systems. Two Project Intrex-designed display terminals are now in operation and both can engage the Intrex system simultaneously. The terminal has been newly named BRISC (Buffered Remote  Interactive Search Console). Users prefer the BRISC to other available terminals because of its large-size characters, bright display and the save-page feature of the terminals. Refinements in the full-text-access system have been made to overcome occasional difficulties experienced in centering text on the cathode-ray-tube screen. (Author/NH)",

As a necessary preliminary to the formulation of educational objectives and the design of appropriate courses, a survey was made of hospital library facilities, resources, services, user groups, budgets and manpower in Ohio. The relationships between the library and the basic hospital functions of the patient care, education and research were also investigated. Results are presented which indicate, in general, that Ohio hospital libraries are under-staffed and that collections, budgets and user services are minimal. Of a total of 227 libraries, 154 (67%) were classified as functional. Minimal services  appears to generate small demands on libraries which in turn perpetuate minimal service. To upgrade existing manpower, and to train new library personnel, a series of courses, the first being in Inter-Library Loan Procedures, is being designed and tested. For the purpose of gaining further insight into the attitudes and expectations of key hospital personnel such as Administrators, Directors of Medical Education, Chiefs of Medical Staff, Directors of Nursing Education, several hundred interviews are presently being conducted in hospitals in the Northeast Ohio Regional Medical Program.

In the area of research into the causes of paper deterioration and remedial techniques, a method of generating broader participation is suggested. An analytical investigation of the merits of alternate methods of text preservation is also proposed. Additional needs in the area of education and  training are identified, and the importance of specific preservation activity by individual libraries is underscored. The fundamental requirement that preservation of library materials be seen as an inseparable part of the broader objective of extending access to recorded information is affirmed. Approaches to developing a capability for collective action are advanced, and measures to be taken in such areas as storage standards, identification and recording of preservation copies, and preservation priorities are suggested.

The study recommends a concentrated  public relations program to make the public library more visible, and proposes a four-point plan of action. First, there should be a publication to direct widespread attention to the public library. Second, extensive research is required to provide knowledge for effective performance. Third, there must be dissemination of this research information to ensure development. Fourth, improved library education and continuing education for librarians is needed. (SJ)",

The objectives of this survey were: to investigate the staff structure and compensation levels of professional librarians in college and university libraries; to explore some relatively new routes for possible advancement - such as the positions of bibliographer, collection builder, curater and other specialists; and to provide the basis for continuation of salary studies if such action seemed warranted. The rates of salary increase obtained by librarians from 1969-70 to 1970-71 appear to be about equal to or somewhat lower than those reported for a comparably ranked faculty. The small number of librarians in highly paid positions offers little attraction to  competent individuals not interested in an administrative career. Suggestions for ways to upgrading the profession include: (1) development of a new administrative trainee track to provide instruction in techniques needed for future libraries, (2) creation of a specialist classification outside the administrative hierarchy and (3) upgrading the professional image.

Analysis of variance was used as the statistical process for determining tests of significance. The experimental classes are the children represented in this project. Both the control and experimental groups were given standardized achievement tests, appropriate for the grade, on corresponding dates. There was no significant difference between the control and experimental groups in the academic achievement of the children in areas of reading comprehension and arithmetic for the first and second grade group. There was found to be a significant  difference in both reading and math for the first grade group. It is concluded that the confrere concept helps the child to develop his social skills and emotional characteristics. Boys as well as girls benefit from their association with an adult male. Each child is able to observe the man's actions and characteristics and to draw personal conclusions regarding the male teacher. (CK)",

It is also stimulated by a belief that British schools must become more responsive to the people they are intended to serve and less controlled by institutional routines and technological requirements. A two-dimensional scheme is proposed for conceptualizing various kinds of educational environments. The scheme requires that two sets of questions be asked. The first set deals with the child as learner. To what extent does he affect what happens to him? The second set relates to the teacher's contributions in influencing the nature and direction of learning. The point is made that in the current enthusiasm for open education, centrality of the teacher's role is often overlooked.  Thus, one critical focus for the evaluation of open education is a focus on teachers. An initial approach to such evaluation might be an interview study of teachers who are working in open settings. Topics discussed would be working environment and the process of open teaching itself. The research focus on children included attempts to look at communication, perception of school, intuition, writing, and quantitative concepts. (CK)",

A minimum definition of conceptual behavior is given: A single response, verbal or nonverbal, under the discriminative control of a group of stimuli whose parameters are defined by the differential reinforcement of the environment. In addition to the role of differential reinforcement in the development of stimulus control, other variables which are very important for the form of that control are procedures effecting stimulus presentation or stimulus programming. It is likely that programming procedures play increasingly important roles in the development of conceptual behavior as that behavior becomes more  complex. One important set of behaviors which appears to fall into successive levels of complexity is mathematics; an analysis of the behavior of counting is given. The model developed consists basically of two assumptions about concept formation: (1) concepts are discriminated operants, with the major controlling variable being differential reinforcement; and (2) learning set procedures teach an organism to discriminate and quickly respond to differential consequences, and the same lesson may be learned at a slower rate while acquiring a large group of concepts in childhood.

        "description":"The Atlanta Public School System conducted four major programs during the summer of 1971. These were Youth-Tutoring-Youth, Community Schools, Handicapped Children, and Prekindergarten Instruction. Evaluation of the Prekindergarten (Pre-K) project was contracted to the Laboratory for Applied Behavior Research at Georgia State University. The Laboratory agreed to: (1) provide consultants to assist in the implementation of behavior modification techniques for use with two basic reading programs utilized in the Pre-K classes, (2) evaluate the use of each reading program in the Pre-K classrooms, irrespective of the program's association with behavior modification procedures, (3) describe the overall academic activities of the Pre-K classes, and (4) suggest specific changes for future  Pre-K projects. The BRL Skills and Concepts Survey was used as the evaluation instrument for this program. After the pre-program measures were taken, the children were divided into two groups: (1) those whom the teacher considered emotionally, behaviorally, and intellectually ready for the BRL reading program, and (2) those whom she considered too young or otherwise not adequately prepared for the BRL format. A main result of this study was the finding that the BRL reading program is superior to others. (Author/CK)",

        "description":"The development of role concepts, as revealed in the ways in which children of different ages conceptualize specific occupational roles, is presented. The conceptualization of roles was studied in groups of 10 boys and 10 girls each from the first, third, and sixth grades. The mean ges of the groups were 6.9, 8.9, and 11.9 years, respectively. Each subject's original response to each of five role concept formation situations was assigned to one of the three following categories: (1) Non-relevant, Irrelevant Response, (2) Concrete Role Identification, and (3) General Role Functions. Differences in type of role conceptualization were analyzed by means of a chi square. The analysis showed that (1) in the youngest group, conceptualizations fell primarily into the category of Concrete  Role Identification; (2) in the two older groups, more than half of the responses fell into the General Role Function category, the number being highest for the oldest group. For all groups, the number of children classified as primarily giving non-relevant responses was minimal. No significant differences due to sex were found. It is concluded that there appears to be a developmental progression from role concepts based on concrete-specific acts and details to those based on general abstract functions. (DB)",

Group care as it now functions is most practical for a mother who works regular daytime hours and lives within manageable commuting distance of a center. The yearly costs per child reported for group care have ranged from a low of $400 to $1300 reported to a high of $2195 to $3895. Costs in family day care range from $114 to $1170 per year with an average of $1040. Surveys of mothers' satisfaction with care all report fairly high satisfaction with their out-of-home arrangements. At present, there is little information on the effects of day care. The definition of quality care given in this study is a program which  substitutes for a good home. Findings of this study also include: (1) Size of day care centers is directly related to the quality of the program; (2) There did not appear to be any great differences in the quality of the programs related to auspices; (3) The quality of teacher performance is directly related to the type and amount of staff training; and (4) Staff of quality day care programs were judged to be more child-centered.

The shortcomings of the Country and society are described in relation to the treatment of foster children, adoption laws, children's institutions, and the attack on Head Start. Director Zigler states that a look at the goals of the Head Start program shows that what has been achieved is quite impressive. He further states that he believes that it is the most important social action effort ever mounted on behalf of needy children in this country. He forsees a progression from Head Start to types of centers that would provide a variety of services for children, one very important one being day care. These centers of the future, he feels, must be heterogeneous in terms of  socioeconomic classes. What this nation must do, Director Zigler says, is develop an entirely new cadre of child care workers, along with more circumscribed training which will receive formal recognition. He also recommends that this nation develop centers to help parents in the parenting function; we should insist, he states, that as part of high school life, every adolescent receives courses in parenting--tutoring children and working in day care centers. Other help for parents will be through programs such as Homestart and a &quot;Sesame Street&quot; for parents. (DB)",

A brief history of previous experience in working with parents of preschool children is also given. Four primary areas of concern have emerged as the work of the Center with parents progressed: (1) Many parents did not possess basic information about normal child development; (2) Many parents had inaccurate perceptions of the role of a nursery school; (3) Many parents did not have the skills or knowledge of available resources to provide stimulating activities that would enhance the cognitive development of their children; and (4) The personal developmental needs of the parents themselves  could not be ignored if they were to improve their competence in the first three areas. The construction of the games led to three accomplishments: (1) A more comfortable situation for talking about the child was provided when the teacher and parent were doing something together while talking; (2) Having a game or definite activity to carry out at home enabled the mother to put into practice her role as a teacher; and (3) As the parent and child played a game together, the mother saw not only herself as a teacher but also her child as a learner, one who was able to learn.

The purpose of such an organization is to enable the teacher to focus her attention on and increase her ability to perceive the unique nature of each of the responses. Within each unit, one constituent of motivation is magnified at one time, and another at another time. In Unit II it is suggested that the teacher set up some goals for each child in order to give him an  opportunity to do something that he will be able to do and thus to help him increase his self-confidence, whereas in Unit III it is suggested that the child be encouraged to set up his own goals. The primary focus of all the experiences suggested is to develop a child's ability to function in processes, i.e., ways of thinking. (CK)",

The purpose of the service is to strengthen existing child care arrangements, recruit new day caregivers, and facilitate the information and referral processes by which new arrangements are made. Some facts gleaned from this study include: (1) The need for day care consists of a lack of  facilities and problems in making arrangements; (2) The informal matchmaking system exists and should be left intact; (3) The feasibility and effectiveness of the service depend on the skill of the consultant in the use of consultation method; (4) The service is effective in stabilizing and improving the quality of private family day care arrangements; (5) The Day Care Neighbor Service has a unique applicability; and (6) The Day Care Neighbor Service is a program adjunct that can be attached to a variety of settings.

The sample used was a fairly successful one of ongoing private family day care arrangements of white, urban working mothers with at least one child under six years of age from a broadly representative cross section of occupations. One fact gleaned from data collection is that most mothers who have their children in private homes prefer these homes over day care centers and most mothers who would prefer day centers already have placed their children in them.

The program continued to focus upon communication skill development and parent involvement. Inservice training for teachers and aides was continuous throughout the year. To determine if more organized, purposeful early childhood experiences would enable the child to attain a higher score on standardized tests, in November 1970 the Boehm Test of Basic Concepts was administered to 363 All Day Kindergarten with Pre-School students, 49 All Day Kindergarten without Pre-School students, and 141 Half-Day Kindergarten students. The Metropolitan Reading Readiness Test was administered in April 1971 to a random sample of six All Day Kindergarten classes and six comparable Half-Day Kindergarten  classes. A total of 806 kindergarten students, only 509 of whom had pre-school, were administered the Boehm in September 1971. Comparisons were made between pre-school and non-pre-school children months after the end of the pre-school treatment. The results showed the pre-school group scored significantly higher than the non-pre-schoolers at the .01 level. Results of the Metropolitan Reading Readiness Test show All Day Kindergarten students to have nearly double the mean of the Half-Day Kindergarten students. (DB)",

Consideration is given for each of the program phases, the learning environment, the rationale for a pre-service workshop and on-going in-service consultancy. This curriculum is based on the premise that, because of the nature of the working and living conditions of migrant families, these children are learning from (1) a limited environment, (2) more indirect modeling of peers and older siblings than from parents, and (3) little, if any, planned and defined learning experiences. Included in the design of the curriculum are: (1) a language-oriented program to bridge the gap between home and school oral language, (2) a task-oriented program to increase  the child's ability to solve problems at his particular stage of intellectual and motor-skill development; (3) an experience-oriented program to assure opportunities for effective relating to school and the larger community, and expanding his knowledge beyond the immediate home environment, (4) a social-emotional development program conducive to growth in self-esteem, and (5) a health and nutritional program to enhance physical well-being necessary for the realization of a total life program.

Growth in the area of intellectual competence was reflected by a significant increase on the Leiter International Performance Scale. The check list completed by the teacher on each of the children also reflected growth in the areas of language development, cognitive  development, physical development, and self-concept.

The subjects were 39 first grade and 42 second grade children. Two instructional units were written and taught to acquaint the students with relations used in the study. Tests administered were: Criterion Test, Conservation of Length Relations Test, Transitivity of Length Relations Test, Seriation Test, and Classification Test. The results clearly confirm the hypothesis that seriation ability of \"linear\" objects can be improved by training. (DB)",

Most of the studies conducted during the research involved observation of children aged 3-12, in mapping and free environmental behavior, and in curricular experiments using perceptual surrogates for map-learning and macro-environmental conceptualization in the lower elementary grades. Other studies deal with topics related to the central problem of place perception, cognition, and cathexis and the need for data and theory which will assist in reforming macro environmental education in geography, social science, and elsewhere. Topics include psychophysics of map and color perception, unschooled environmental learning in peasant communities, epistemological assumptions (and their origins) underlying  macro-spatial teaching, cognitive-cathectic beliefs found in textbooks and analyzed ethnogeographically, and the logical-linguistic-iconic structure of the map language. The main finding has been that mapping behavior is so highly developed before school-entering age that formal map skills and theoretical concepts in geography, social science, etc., are easily and eagerly grasped. A general model of environmental learning has resulted in a curriculum model that is now being tested in three states and Puerto Rico.

        "description":"In order to determine the willingness of rural disadvantaged to participate in educational programs, 125 rural male Anglo and Mexican American household heads, both on and off welfare, were interviewed. The stratified sample was drawn from 4 Michigan counties. Based on findings from the 81 questions, these conclusions were made: Mexican Americans were more willing to participate in educational classes than Anglos, and both groups desired to participate in such classes to get a job or a better job; there was no difference in willingness of these groups to participate in educational programs on the basis of welfare or nonwelfare status; decisions to participate would tend to be determined by the character of a prospective job; respondents were willing to participate in classes  pertaining to their personal, educational, and social welfare (e.g., classes on buying food or obtaining credit); respondents tended to see themselves favorably in terms of ability to be hired for a job, run their own business, or be leaders; respondents indicated that classes should last no longer than 6 months; transportation to class was viewed as a problem; respondents would not spend their own money for tuition or supplies; age, residence, miles to high school, educational achievement, number of children, income, size of town shopped in, and time lived in Michigan did not affect willingness of the respondents to participate in classes; and proximity to a community college or university did affect willingness to participate. Included in the document are the study description, study  implications, the questionnaire, and a guide for identifying disadvantaged household heads. (MJB)",

As reported, K-3 bilingual children in 4 public elementary schools that tended to be homogeneous with regard to the children's cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds were placed in 1 of 3 instructional settings: (1) an experimental English program where only English was used as an instructional language, (2) an experimental Spanish/English program where both languages were  used, and (3) a control program. The report discusses the program's effectiveness in terms of such factors as Spanish vs. English instruction, children's intellectual development and self-concept, parental involvement, and the children's bicultural interaction. Although \"results of the K-3 experiment still are...inconclusive,\" it is indicated that the program is providing\"...a very valuable set of learning experiences in both the cognitive and affective domains.\" Also included in the report is a post-program evaluation, completed in the fall of 1970, to examine the effectiveness of the summer session experience as measured by the Metropolitan Achievement Test; 10 tables summarize the significant differences and the analyses proper, which indicate that the summer sessions appear to have a  beneficial effect on achievement.

Institutions surveyed were those with (1) a program for recruiting American Indians, (2) a distinct staff devoted to American Indians, and (3) some course about American Indians offered in a Native American Studies program or in conjunction with another department. The study revealed that most special library programs were under the control of the campus library; that the average collection size was 1,500 volumes for or about Native Americans; and that personnel commitment per library averaged less than 1 full-time equivalent working with a Native American library program. An expanded acquisitions program was rated the most  needed library service. Major problems pointed up by the survey included the lack of definite personnel commitments to library programs for Native American Studies, the absence of professional librarians who are American Indians, and the lack of adequate funding in addition to normal library budgeting.

Major findings of the task force are that economic development of the North is confined to a few centers; that a large number of northern people do not live in these economic centers; that the northern people have expressed a desire for better communications; and that Canada's Anik Satellite Program was proposed as a  great benefit to the North. Conclusions reached by the Task Force include the following: that the people not living in the economic centers seriously lack communication facilities and that the Anik program will not be in accord with the expressed wishes of northerners and will not be in line with the types of communications required for social change.

        "description":"Underlying present Governmental and private objectives to institute local control over the schools on Indian reservations is the hope that such a policy will improve American Indians' sense of relevance of their own behavior to the outcome of their destiny. Although the connection between community control and sense of personal efficacy has never been established among American Indians, an interrelationship between the 2 has nontheless been hypothesized widely among scholars. In order to gain further insight into the nature of this interrelationship, this study undertook a preliminary examination of factors involved in instituting local control over the schools in the Indian communities of San Juan and Santa Clara. Interviews conducted in the 2 communities revealed that, while  members of both pueblos have an interest in controlling their schools, Santa Clara has progressed much further toward actualizing this goal. Both communities have Advisory School Boards, but Santa Clara has exploited this opportunity for local control to a greater degree than San Juan and has subcontracted for complete local control over their schools. One revealing factor is that San Juan's attachment to traditional institutions and cultural patterns has served to limit the economic development and political influence of the community; in Santa Clara, commitment to modern techniques has allowed for greater diversification of the pueblo's resources and has contributed toward making this pueblo a viable community.

        "description":"Several studies have been done about Mexican Americans but, in the area of their mental health, \"a scant dozen articles are worth reviewing.\" Since the literature has been consistent in reflecting that a low socioeconomic level combined with extensive use of Spanish lowers IQ test scores of Mexican Americans, these factors should be studied in connection with the educational achievement of Mexican Americans and their mental health (i.e., in terms of such personality types as obsessive-compulsive, impulsive, schizophrenic, passive-dependent, and depressive). This could be done because Mexican Americans are highly distinguishable from other ethnic groups and are set apart by such factors as low median family income, speaking Spanish as a first language, a behavior and value system  reflecting another culture, and a tendency to live in barrios. In such a study, 8 hypotheses are proposed for testing on a random sample of large numbers of Mexican Americans from all socioeconomic levels and ages, from every state in the Southwest, from rural and urban settings, from the Chicano militant element, from colleges, and from the Hispano component. The actual survey should be done by special questionnaire and a short adapted form of standard personality tests with some in Spanish. Examiners should be Mexican Americans highly trained in psychiatric interviewing procedures. In summary, this investigation should be a broad-based study on the mental health and educational achievement of Mexican Americans. (NQ)",

This study would be a combination of survey research (testing scores, percentages, etc. of students at given grades) and research for hypothesis testing wherein a random sample of the total Mexican American population would be used. It is noted that such a study would provide large quantities of data on sociologic, family, education, cognitive, and personality functioning and would assess the co-variation and influence of each of these variables on each of the other variables.

Housing of 1,413 respondents (household heads) was categorized as having complete plumbing, partial plumbing, or no plumbing. Several variables were then defined for each type of housing, and cross-tabulation with chi-square tests for statistical significance was used for analysis. Variables selected for regression analysis included current value of house and land, educational attainment of household head, and net  family income for a single year. Major findings of the survey were that (1) the quality of rural housing was significantly related to household incomes; (2) the level of formal education of the household head and of the wife, and the type of employment of the household head, were significantly related to housing quality; (3) age and sex of the household head were not significantly related to housing quality; (4) there was a significantly high correlation between the market value of house and land and quality of housing; (5) farm housing was about the same quality as rural nonfarm housing; (6) renters did not occupy significantly poorer housing than did owners; and (7) of the households with incomes that placed them in the seriously deprived class, 63% lived in substandard housing.

A total of 92 junior high students, 58 high school students, 35 college students, and 82 adult Indians participated in the study. The control group was composed of 103 junior high students, 97 high school students, 40 college students, and 45 adults. The instrument used was the &quot;Problem Check List&quot; (Rural Youth Form, Junior High School Form, College Form,  and Adult Form). The problems were totaled by areas (health and physical concerns, relationship with people, citizenship, education, vocational and economic concerns, morals and religion, personal temperament, courtship and marriage, social and recreational concerns, and home and family), sex, levels, and groups. A percentage was computed for every problem in every group and level for all females and males. An analysis of selected significant percentages was then made. It was concluded that the Turtle Mountain Reservation group and the control group problem incidences were not significantly different, but the females in both groups reported more problems than did the males.

In this report of that project, the educational needs of migrant children are discussed in terms of such factors as equal opportunity, identification and citizenship, attitudes, mastery of English, vocational guidance, living conditions, provision of adequate educational programs at all  levels, and supplementary financing. Attainment of project objectives is examined in terms of record transfer systems, model programs, coordination of programs, improvement of educational opportunities, and inservice education programs. In conclusion, 25 recommendations for improvement of educational opportunities for migrant children are listed. Three appendices provide information on records and record transfers. (PS)",

        "description":"The Mesa School District (Arizona) \"Incentives Only\" Project--carried out via a performance contract with the U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity in 1970-71 through the Mesa Education Association (MEA)--is described in terms of rationale for the use of incentives, background, program procedures, the incentives model, the delivery system, evaluation (including student and teacher reactions to the project), and general conclusions. Specific project goals, as developed by the MEA, were (1) to participate in research to determine if the use of student and teacher incentives can accelerate achievement in reading and mathematics for disadvantaged students, (2) to engender in the student the desire to learn for the sake of learning (knowledge becomes the incentive), and (3) to  functionalize the MEA's involvement in process and decision-making which affects the education of children. Experimental- and control-group students in grades 1-3 and 7-9 at project schools were selected to participate on the basis of 2 criteria: low achievement and low family income. It was concluded that the notion of attacking educational problems through national research is valid and desirable; funding sources must allow researchers to be more realistic in their goals; and the use of incentives did not accelerate achievement for disadvantaged students as per the guaranteed achievement gains of .8 months in the basic skills.

Subjects were 85 first graders and 15 second graders in the project rooms and 69 first graders and 20 second graders in control rooms at a neighboring school district. Treatment in the in-class auding centers consisted of 20-minutes daily of auding skills instruction, 20-minutes daily of literature and/or music instruction, plus teacher/pupil discussions and individual use of the auding center. The Gates-MacGinitie Reading Tests showed that the two groups had equal readiness skills. Forms A and B of the Metropolitan Achievement Tests were administered in December and May, respectively as pretest and post-test.  Statistical analysis showed the treatment to be significant at the .01 level in the improved scores of project pupils in reading, auditory discrimination, and listening but statistically insignificant in improving word knowledge or word discrimination. The Wepman Auditory Discrimination Test and Durrell Listening-Reading Series were administered in February and April, respectively, and comparison of results on both tests favored the project pupils. In addition to the tests, subjective evaluations of teachers, pupils, and parents resulted in the judgment that the pupils responded positively and enthusiastically to the project.

A number of techniques were employed for the overall assessment of the program. Various group test data which documented pupil progress  for the implementation of prescriptive instruction were used, and several test analyses were developed.

Seven out of 10 people read or look at a newspaper during a typical day, and they spend an average of about one-half hour with it. Most reading time is spent on the main news, local news, and comics. The most frequently given reasons for reading newspapers are to obtain general information, to obtain specific information, and to obtain another view on issues. Socioeconomic status of the newspaper readers or nonreaders is not markedly different. However, higher socioeconomic status is often  connected to reading more than one paper, reading newspapers at work, and with reading editorials, letters to the editor, sports sections, and movie, book, or other reviews. Almost all respondents reported reading something while shopping, most often to find specific information. About 4 percent of the respondents were classified as nonreaders; one-half of these nonreaders were visually handicapped, one-fourth were foreign language readers, and one-fourth were illiterate.

Sixty-nine undergraduates were divided into three groups equally; each group heard the passages once, twice, or three times before recalling. Effects of the logical structure were seen in the kinds of idea units remembered, the stability of these units in consecutive recalls, and the tendency for clustering of idea units on this basis. In addition, serial position, importance of idea units,  and order of recall were examined with the recall data. It was found that units high in the logical hierarchy were recalled more frequently than those lower in the hierarchy, that subjects tended to recall groups of units from the passages which were related to one another in the hierarchical structure, and that the stability of each unit recall was substantially related to its position in the logical structure of the passage.

The purpose of the model is to allow a combination of desired properties of experimental and correlational methods. It yields disordinal interactions when experimental situations are carefully planned, but may yield ordinal interactions when they are not. Situations in which the model might prove valuable are outlined, and recommendations are made for using the model in reading research. It is emphasized that (1) close attention must be paid to defining experimental manipulations, (2) familiarity with instructional and aptitudinal variables is necessary, and (3) careful analysis of theoretical models of learning  before application of the model to a research situation should avoid negative results. Reading research studies in which the ATI model was used are described, and figures and references are included. (MS)",

Its usefulness in determining readability levels was examined in an analysis of language samples from 20 elementary tradebooks used as supplementary reading materials. Three 200- to 300-word samples were selected to represent the beginning, middle, and end of each book. The TEXAN program was used to analyze the 60 samples according to four readability formulas: Gunning's \"Fog\" Index, Spache's Grade Level Indicator, Flesch's Reading Ease Index, and Flesch's Human Interest Index. Chi-square analysis and analysis of variance indicated that the samples were internally consistent. Relatively high  correlations were found between the Gunning and Spache formulas, moderately low correlations were found between the Flesch formulas, and negative correlations were found between the two Flesch formulas and the Gunning and Spache formulas. It was concluded that the TEXAN program can be useful in analyzing readability, particularly when more than one formula is to be applied to a sample. Tables are included. (MS)",

        "description":"The three papers in this resource guide are oriented to the needs of Spanish-surnamed and Indian children. The first paper points out three concerns to be examined before selecting reading materials: (1) the population for whom selection is planned, (2) criteria emphasizing children's needs, and (3) apparent trends in reading instructional materials appropriate for the population. Critical points for selection and evaluation of reading instructional materials for Indian and Spanish-speaking children are discussed. The second paper stresses teacher-student interaction, diagnostic teaching, and classroom management in the elementary school. The author feels that standardized tests, especially their norms, should not be used with minority groups, but that the informal reading  inventory is best for these children. He also refers to four approaches used to teach non-English-speaking children and to four language measures. The third paper observes that schools are serving the interests of the dominant social forces, and that while unable to reform schools, teachers can humanize their classrooms by examining and revising certain beliefs which lend to anti-humanistic school practices. Recognition of individual differences and use of evaluation as formative in a diagnostic sense are strongly recommended. References are included. (AW)",

The project, part of Project I of the Targeted Research and Development Program in Reading, sought to identify characteristics of literacy levels and to define tasks which might be used in a criterion-referenced test to assess possession of those characteristics. It was felt that such tasks should realistically reflect adults' everyday reading behavior and should be associated with benefits which adults might realize from being able to perform the tasks. It was also decided that tasks should be practical rather than academic and that numbers of tasks of a given point be based on frequency and duration of time spent in real-life activities upon which the tasks are based. In  addition, self-reported nonreaders' statements of their abilities ought to be considered. It is planned that once items are developed based on such criteria, a panel of test developers will construct psychometrically sound instruments from the large bank of items developed by project participants.

The survey was part of an effort to develop a test of adult literacy based on practical reading situations in which adults might find themselves and was part of the Targeted Research and Development Program in Reading, Project I. Each respondent was interviewed concerning his reading activities for 1 day. Questions concerned kinds of materials read; sections of materials read; kinds and variety of reading activities which were connected with work, play, school, or church activities; and time spent in reading. Newspapers were most often read, followed by mail, magazines,  and books. Respondents varied in age from 16 to 60 and represented several educational and socioeconomic levels. General activities related to reading included travel, commuting, recreation, and free time. Only a small portion of respondents reported difficulty in reading any of the materials, leading the author to conclude that readability is not a problem for most adults. (MS)",

His expose is two-fold. \"Man is an epidemic, multiplying at a superexponential rate, destroying the environment upon which he depends, and threatening his own extinction. He treats the world as a storehouse existing for his delectation; he plunders, rapes, poisons, and kills this living system, the biosphere, in ignorance of its workings and its fundamental value.\" In contrast, \"survival of man is contingent upon categorical rejection of this cultural inferiority complex that is the Western view, and its replacement with the ecological view--man in nature. This reveals the ways of the working world and shows our ignorant interventions as  self-mutilation, leading to suicide, genocide, biocide.\" To determine if man can survive, he concludes with the question, \"Are you healthy? If you find any system which is healthy, you have found a system which has been able to find a propitious environment, adapt the environment, and adapt itself . . . The battle is really for survival first, and fulfillment next.\" (Author/BL)",

The message points up the importance of decisive action by the Congress to adopt and implement measures that would strengthen present programs, control emerging problems and promote overall environmental quality. New areas of concern focus on: (1) tightening pollution control, (2) making technology an environmental ally, (3) improving land use, (4) protecting our natural heritage, (5) expanding international cooperation on the environment, (6) protecting children from  lead-based paint, and (7) enlisting the young.

The instrument was administered to all 325 students taking a second course in calculus with economic applications, near the end of the course; and separate evaluation ratings were obtained for the course, the teachers, and the examinations. An achievement rating (average midterm score) was also obtained for each student, and correlations between this rating and the SET ratings were investigated for each section of the class. Also, a one-way analysis of variance was run to investigate a possible relation between these ratings over the entire class. In most sections, the  correlations between achievement and SET ratings were positive, but only 24 out of 48 were significant at the 5 percent level. The analysis of variance investigation revealed no further relationships. The authors conclude that the SET instrument under consideration may give unbiased evaluations for one teacher and biased evaluations for another, and, as such, is not to be recommended for general use.

Students in the experimental group who failed to achieve 80 percent on an evaluative checktest for a subunit were required to participate in some corrective measure: repeating the study of the subunit, studying the objectives, reading a portion of a manuscript, conferring with the instructor, or some combination of these. The control group was not required to achieve mastery on any of the subunits. At intervals during the course both groups were examined and the composite score of the exams, The Biology Achievement Test, was compared for the  groups. Both groups had been pretested, with analysis of covariance used to account for initial differences in the two groups. The achievement of the experimental group significantly exceeded that of the control. Although students in the experimental group spent significantly more time in course work, primarily in the laboratory, than did those in the control group, they also exhibited a more positive reaction to the course.

A sample of 60 graduate students was randomly assigned to three groups. The experimental task, administered via a computer teletype terminal, required subjects to find the arithmetic rule by which a given number was derived from three other given numbers. Subjects in the first group were taught a focussing strategy; the second group were taught a scanning strategy; and the third (control) group were taught no strategy, but used the same two practice problems as the other two groups. All subjects then worked on five experimental problems. The degree of focussing, purity of strategy, and number  of trials to criterion were obtained from the computer record and analyzed by an analysis of variance and a multiple comparison test. Results showed that subjects taught conservative focussing showed the most focussing, but that subjects taught successive scanning also showed more focussing than the control group; the conservative focussing group used the purest strategy, but the successive scanning group was no purer than the control group; and neither experimental group was significantly more efficient at finding the rule than the control group. It is suggested that unmeasured personality factors may have been responsible for the unexpected results obtained. (MM)",

The project was conducted in five junior high schools and five elementary schools in two quarters of the year 1970-71. In the fall quarter, each student teacher tutored an eighth grade student twice a week and spent some time observing regular teachers; in the winter quarter, the student teacher served as a teaching assistant on two half-days a week. Various tests of mathematical ability, personality, and attitude to teaching were administered to the student teachers at different times during the project. Significant gains are reported on several scales. The eighth grade students were given attitude and achievement tests; and significant differences  between those who did and did not receive tutoring are reported for some of the attitude scales. The student teachers and the elementary school teachers completed questionnaires related to the project, and the responses indicated a generally positive reaction to the project. (MM)",

Kindergarten children from one school were pretested on addition and subtraction of the numbers zero through five; and eight groups of five subjects were randomly selected from those scoring below the mean. These groups were then randomly assigned to four treatments obtained by two levels of characterization with or without role-playing. All groups used a number line with colored houses representing the numbers zero through five. At one level of characterization, the numbers to be added or subtracted were represented by animal figures moving between the houses; at the other level, numbers were represented by numerals in the usual way. The role-playing groups acted out the movements;  the other groups only vocalized the results. All treatments lasted for seven sessions. The pretest was repeated as a posttest, and again a week later as a retention test. The results showed that the group using numeral representation without role-playing learned considerably more than all the other groups; an ANOVA confirmed the significance of these differences for the posttest but not the retention test. The authors suggest various explanations for some of the unexpected patterns observed in the results, particularly the uncontrolled sex factor. (MM)",

        "description":"An information-theory model of human memory was tested in thirteen experiments which involved children (six years and older) and graduate students. The subjects conducted science investigations in laboratory and non-laboratory settings, solved problems of electrical circuits, and participated in classroom science lessons. The tasks used involved problem solving, recognition, and immediate and delayed recall. The model gave meaningful descriptions of cognitive processing, allowed isolation of several memory processes, and provided evidence of learning information processing. The differences in the kind of information processed during various cognitive tasks were due to interactions; for example, between input information and long-term memory. Problem solving tasks involved  controlling and balancing &quot;noise&quot; in the input and output information channels; recall processing differed from problem solving by an inverse management of noise control. The data represent the first significant demonstration of Shannon's 1948 theorem on error capacity of communication channels. The model, with universal applications for describing human behavior, may allow interpretation of how and when learning occurs. (A glossary of terms and data tables are appended. A simplified diagrammatic version of the model is included.) (Author/AL)",

(Connecting two light bulbs and a dry cell so that when both bulbs light, one bulb can be unscrewed, leaving the other lit.) Fifteen male and fifteen female students of each race were randomly selected from each grade level. After the problem was verbally explained, the sequence of connections made by each student was coded. The data processed by successful and unsuccessful students of each race and sex were analyzed separately in terms of Moser's model. Contingency table analyses, t-tests and regression analyses of the parameters of the model were  made. All successful students processed most of the information in the short-term memory and showed more long-term memory retrieval than unsuccessful students. The relative number of successful solutions did not differ with respect to race or sex. The information flow patterns found in this study were similar to other examples of problem solving analyzed in terms of the Moser model and were characterized by high noise levels in the information channels. Full data for the calculated &quot;information values&quot; are appended. A glossary containing information theory terms and definitions of the model parameters is also appended. (AL)",

In a verbal chain one subject repeated the substance of a communication to a second person, who in turn relayed the information. Each subject then wrote a statement of what was heard. Other tasks included verbal problem solving and immediate and delayed recall. Between one and one-and-one-half bits of long term memory information were processed in problem solving and recall tasks. Some subjects restructured the terms of a communication during recall and differed in problem solving  strategies. There were interactions between information input and information retrieved from long-term memory. Subjects could tolerate 47.6 percent increase of information input before &quot;noise&quot; interfered with problem solving. In recall tasks there was a 59.7 percent decrease of information input.

        "description":"Elementary science teachers allow an average of one second for a response to a question, and follow a student response by a comment within an average of nine-tenths of a second. When these two &quot;wait times&quot; are extended to three to five seconds, a number of changes occur in student variables. There are increases in the length of the response, the number of unsolicited appropriate responses, student confidence, incidence of speculative responses, incidence of child-child data comparisons, incidence of evidence-inference statements, frequency of student questions, and incidence of responses from &quot;relatively slow&quot; students. The number of teacher questions which do not elicit a response decreases. Teacher characteristics change as wait-times increase. There is an increased flexibility  of teacher responses, the questioning pattern becomes more variable, teacher expectations for performance of students rated as &quot;slow&quot; may change. These generalizations are based upon five years of study of video-taped lessons or micro-teaching sessions. These studies also suggest some research hypotheses concerning the effect of verbal reward and wait-time on students' perceptions of their degree of environmental control: low incidence of verbal reward and a long wait-time may reduce fatalism.

Two factors were: (1) the size of the numbers a and b; and (2) the context of the sentence, whether presented alone or as a step in the solution of a verbal problem. A 16-item test was constructed by completely crossing sentence type with these two factors, and administered to a random sample of 16 boys and 16 girls drawn from three representative elementary schools. A latin square procedure was used to control any item sequence effects, and every child received the same 16 items in a different order. Response scores, analyzed by MANOVA, showed that: (1)  there was no significant sex effect; (2) the sentence type a - N = b was significantly more difficult than the other types, which did not differ significantly; (3) sentences with one-digit numbers were significantly easier than those with two digit numbers; and (4) the verbal problems used in the test were not more difficult than the corresponding abstract number sentences.

He presents evidence to show that racial mixes and interactions, without quality education, cannot and do not achieve these goals. The author then discusses four reasons for the inadequacies of integrated education: paradoxical teachers and teaching; patronizing curriculum; sterile instructional materials; and silent administrators. This is followed by an examination of the impact of these factors on different kinds of schools. In the third section of the paper, Toward  Quality in Education, six components of quality education are proposed and discussed: a democratic school, quality teachers and teaching, integrated curriculum, authentic instructional resources, vigorous support from the school administration, and community-family-school relations. The caution is added that unless schools are joined by other social institutions, educational efforts toward an integrated society will have little effect. In conclusion, the author discusses some additional suggestions for advancing democratic human relations through education. (Author/JLB)",

Emphasis is on how to make the institutes more effective. Primary purposes of the summer institutes are to: 1) change what and how students learn in elementary and secondary school classrooms; and, 2) change college and university teachers and courses in which prospective teachers are educated. Common patterns as to participants, faculty characteristics, and structured content are evident in these reports. Institutes concentrated on narrow topics organized around a period, problem, or theme, and attempted to teach something new and innovative. Effective institutes are exemplary, advanced, innovative, intense and cogent motivating forces. Institutes are  most successful in renewing teacher's interest in and teaching them something new about the content of their subject, but less successful in helping teachers change their teaching methods, or to use different and new material and media in their courses. Experiences of the summer institutes indicate that college and university teachers need to understand the limits, possibilities, and politics of teaching in the schools, about what can be changed, and how changes occur in a system.

Human dignity should imply to every citizen the worth of each individual--worth that exists because the individual exists and not because of his achievements. Some of the overall objectives for the unit are that the student: 1) better understand and accept himself as an individual and member of a group; 2) become aware of the awesome responsibility of being a pre-adolescent and react to the conflicts and problems arising from this; 3)  demonstrate by examples and discussion that knowledge should result in action. A number of themes are examined through written exercises, role-playing, and other activities. Among them are: universals and differences among men; self concept and identity; individuality; maturity; social roles; socialization influences; stereotyping; self confidence; human needs; apathy; dissent; nonconformity; extremism; and inference vs. fact.

New programs should help students develop analytical skills while learning to empathize like humanists. Objectives, incorporating a combination of humanistic, citizenship and intellectual education, are to help the child: 1) develop an adequate self concept; 2) desire to preserve our national heritage; 3) understand conflicts and how to resolve conflicts; 4) develop loyalty to the state, nation, and to all mankind; 5) accept need for social change; 6) build awareness of the value of work; 7) comprehend the ideal of  the dignity of man; and, 8) understand the concept of government by consent of the governed. Key substantive concepts to be considered in a program are: causality, conflict, cooperation, cultural change, differences, independence, modification, power, and social control. Content and instructional strategies are utilized to achieve the stated purposes and to help develop understanding of key concepts. Almost half of the book is devoted to social studies scope and sequence outlines, grades 1-6, from the Albuquerque, Las Cruces, and Los Alamos Public Schools.

A full understanding of specific parliamentary procedures and methods used in the federal legislative branch is also required. Objectives of the course are for students to: 1) examine the basic techniques used in preparation and delivery of a persuasive speech; 2) construct a mock legislature; 3) formulate a bill reflecting a specific point of view on a current issue of considerable public interest; 4) debate the issues involved in a specific bill; 5) synthesize all points of view expressed in the legislative debates. It is hoped that by the end  of the course the student will realize that legislation is a long and careful process which prevents hasty law making. Legislation is seen as an avenue for solution of problems in society and a process that will insure the success of our American government.

Experimental problems are: 1) can philosophy be taught as a regular subject; 2) if so, how; 3) what are the problems; and 4) what objectives, methods, materials, and evaluation processes are valid and useful for high school philosophy? The project selected 14 college instructors, some with high school experience, to teach a one semester course in philosophy in 10 cooperating Chicago area high schools -- two inner city and eight affluent suburban schools. Nearly 2,000 students enrolled in one of the courses during the project, fewer students than requested the course. Feedback from project staff, students, other teachers, administrators, and  formal evaluation teams assisted coordination and formative evaluation. Other reported aspects of the project and its evaluation include: school and community setting, course and unit patterns, teaching materials, teachers, classrooms, evaluations, and recommendations. The latter two sections are based on what was concluded to be demonstrated feasibility and effectiveness of the high school philosophy courses. (DJB)",

A group of six elementary education and social studies specialists were chosen to examine each of these books in terms of the degree to which the textbook fairly includes recognition of the achievements and accomplishments of various ethnic and racial groups. From this broad criterion, the Committee set up a list of 19 specific criteria. Some of these are: 1) What are the implicit assumptions of the content, both pictorial and verbal; 2) Is the  legitimacy of a variety of life styles acknowledged; 3) Are present-day problems realistically presented; and, 4) Are ethnocentric views reinforced or worked against? The Committee found that though these textbooks were, perhaps, not as good as they might be, still, as a group, they represent an improvement over similar books published only a few years ago. However, the textbooks still do not present the great social problems of our time in as direct a way as they might. The report also presents reviews by the Committee of each of the textbooks included in the study. (Author/JLB)",

        "description":"It is time that sociology made use of the increasingly popular teaching device of linking computer simulation and gaming. It is needed because in teaching courses in urban sociology, human ecology, and urban planning, we have found that: a) most class exercises present the community as a statis phenomenon; b) there is no quick and easy way to impress upon students the nature of the limited resources available and the forces competing for them; and, c) even sophisticated and well-educated persons have only a hazy conception of how communities function. What is needed is a tool for getting across some perspective and sophistication for dealing with the basic materials that must precede formal analysis, and gaming-simulations provide this. METROPOLIS and C.L.U.G. have both been  developed into packages that can be adopted by any sociology department with computer facilities. C.L.U.G. focuses on the spatial pattern of urban growth and land use. METROPOLIS focuses on the political and long-range planning roles of urban government. M.E.T.R.O. joins the approaches of these two and adds refinements of its own to make a sophisticated instrument. It deals with ideal-types of governments, roles, issues, programs, and budgets.

Responsibility for this inadequacy rests with many, but we shall focus on the role of academicians. University academicians, though they have kept their educator-colleagues at a disrespectful distance, have allowed educators' students to attend academicians' classes. The result has been that future teachers have shared the mediocre education accorded most undergraduates, and they have had bad examples of teaching set before them. With some exceptions, participation in educational endeavors by the universities has been peripheral. We need to drastically alter the relationship between the universities, on the one hand, and teacher education and the  schools on the other. The major requirements are: 1) an organization of knowledge that provides insight into discipline relationships; 2) institutional changes that encourage participation by academics in educational efforts; 3) a change in faculty attitudes and interests; and, 4) new concepts, methods and arrangements for teaching subject matter to teachers.

        "description":"Synectics is a method of creative problem solving through the use of metaphor and apparent irrelevancy developed by William J. J. Gordon. The process involves rational knowledge of the problem to be solved, irrational improvisations that lead to fertile associations creating new approaches to the problem, and euphoric state that is essential in the process of creative genius. Applying synectics to social problems leads to model construction but not actual problem solving. Synectics has significant applications on all secondary school grade levels in that it provides a well structured methodology for developing both creative and critical thought processes to students who must operate effectively in a society oriented to problem stating and problem solving. In Gordon's book,  Synectics, the trend of his illustrations is almost totally industrial-pragmatic. A final chapter however, &quot;Social Applications,&quot; suggests non-technological utilization of synectic processes: 1) establishment of a school think group made up of faculty, administration, and custodial staff; and, 2) use of synectic techniques in an experimental senior level course.

        "description":"This final report discloses findings of a survey team composed of fifteen historians and social studies specialists on 1965 NDEA institutes in history. An attempt is made to identify the nature of a summer institute and how it differs from regular teacher education. Objectives include answering three questions: 1) What kind of teachers attended summer institutes in 1965, and why? 2) What sort of training are they given, and how relevant is it to their needs? 3) How effective did this experience seem to be in improving both their knowledge of history and their own classroom instruction? Major findings are that participants are above-average, well prepared, able, motivated, and experienced teachers. Most institutes help teachers learn more about history, imparting new  interpretations and viewpoints; a small number acquaint them with teaching materials in the field; and only a few introduce teachers to new educational media and teaching strategies and help participants transfer knowledge acquired in the institute to their teaching. An important outcome of institutes is that historians and education specialists exchanged ideas and views. The team concludes that there is room for variety, flexibility, and experimentation in conducting successful summer institutes. Appendices are included. (Author/SJM)",

        "description":"Historically most tutoring studies have been concerned with the impact on the students being tutored. Recently there has been a tendency to look at the impact on the tutor and even to focus the program on that impact. A few recent studies have been concerned with discovering ways to improve the program itself. It has not been possible to isolate the factors which lead to success for the tutors, and in some cases they seem to have been successful in spite of the conditions in which they worked. The focus of the materials and skills has been on the tutee even when the researcher's major concern was with the tutor, and the teachers of the tutors adjust their curriculum to support that of the teachers of the tutees, so that the older students can tutor them. These generalizations  suggest that classroom teachers can take advantage of the effect of tutoring upon the tutor through the commonalities that exist within the school curriculum and can encourage tutors to acquire new skills. In tutoring the younger students, the tutor is provided with a unique opportunity to transfer such skills from a knowledge level of learning to an application of knowledge through the principle of learning through teaching. By cooperation at the teacher level, both groups would benefit with the tutor gaining more from the experience than he has done in the past. (MBM)",

        "description":"Program descriptions from 44 training institutions were examined regarding the process they employed in teacher education. Eight questions designed to identify various aspects of the process were applied to the written descriptions. The responses illustrate that: 1) program experiences are developed primarily by examination of the teaching task and other training programs; 2) expectations are conveyed to students through course offerings and through written and informal statements of goals; 3) student information consists primarily of academic ability represented by grades and faculty rating; 4) there is little indication of how student information is used; 5) student evaluation is mainly by observation of outside personnel, grades, and some self-evaluation; 6) criterion measures  of effectiveness are the achievement of specific program goals and reports on teacher performance; 7) most programs have limited flexibility; and 8) preservice and in-service programs are usually seen as separate entities, and contacts between teachers are mostly informal and do not affect the nature of the basic program. The author concludes that programs now appear to meet only the needs of teachers to survive in the classroom. For teachers to be innovative and meet the needs of their students, they must participate in programs that are innovative and that meet their needs. (MBM)",

A pilot study and a main study were undertaken, using experimental and control groups. The experimental groups had an orientation session before the start of the project, and tutors had a training session. The program was carried out for 8 months in the pilot study and 3 months in the main study. Informal evidence clearly indicated that the program was enthusiastically accepted by teachers, parents, and students. Analyzing the data on five dependent variables, it was found that tutors and tutees in the experimental group evidenced significant growth on measures of academic  achievement, motivation as assessed by the teachers and the students, and, for the tutors, in attitude toward school. The only objectives which were not met were a favorable change in the self-concept of both tutors and tutees and a positive attitude change in tutees, probably due to the short duration of the project. It is suggested that teachers should be provided with training and support for a change to a self-directed instructional program, and a teacher manual is being developed.

The suggested ways of resolving these conflicts are a) to define the role of the curriculum supervisor as a service function to teachers, b) to utilize the concept of empathy in role taking to help both parties understand as much as possible about the characteristic features of their respective positions, and c) to adopt norm setting conferences to consolidate and unlock emotions.

The programs were established to seek out and fund innovative classroom projects designed by teachers and to demonstrate the school system's faith in the ability and creativity of the individual teacher. All teachers, librarians, counselors, and specialists were eligible to submit proposals, and a committee selected those to be funded. Background information was gathered through interviews, on-site visitations, and seminars using instruments such as a pre-evaluation questionnaire, an evaluation  checklist, a post-evaluation questionnaire, and a creativity impact measure. Results indicated a very positive teacher reaction, with many valuable innovative projects. Teachers gained skills in using new techniques, new enriching experiences were provided for the students, learning was improved, attitudes were changed, and improvement was made in oral and written communication. New ideas and techniques were publicized for use by non-involved teachers giving incentives for others to try innovative projects. (MBM)",

        "description":"This paper reviews the principles, implementation, management, formats, problems, and research in modular instruction. A module is defined as a self-contained, independent unit of a planned series of learning activities designed to help the student accomplish certain well-defined objectives. The learner is able to proceed at his own rate, choose his own learning mode, select among a variety of topics, identify his strengths and weaknesses, and recycle if necessary. Ideally modules should include a pretest, objectives, criteria for success, instructional activities, a posttest, and remedial instruction. When designing a module, the following steps are recommended: a) identification of the subject matter to be taught, b) definition of a set of objectives and evaluation items, c) a  decision upon the hierarchy of the objectives and sequence of instruction, d) statement of rationale, e) development of a pretest, f) design of units of written instruction and selection of study materials, g) provision of instructional options, h) design of a posttest, and i) arrangement for a resource center. Examples of five actual formats are included; student, instructor, and administrator problems are indicated; and there is a brief review of research, a glossary, and a bibliography. (MBM)",

It was believed that such a program by testing participants to their limits both physically and psychologically would better prepare them to survive stress, control their emotions, and work well with other people. The evaluation of the program was by means of a) a faculty questionnaire with 65 questions prepared by the faculty and completed by the students, b) a student questionnaire with 24 questions prepared by a volunteer group of students and completed by students, and c) the Thurston Temperament Schedule administered to the students as a pretest and posttest. Results from all  three instruments are included and show that the program was a beneficial experience in regard to personality characteristics and in the improvement of faculty-student relationships. More teaching of skills and group leadership by program leaders is recommended, together with more emphasis on health and sanitary considerations.

Recommendations are made concerning alternative financial policies, and there is a survey of the alternatives which other states have employed to assist financially non-public schools and/or the parents of non-public school students. The population for the study included all the non-public schools that enrolled students above the kindergarten level, but excluded trade and technical schools for post secondary students. Participation was  voluntary and 56 schools supplied data, representing about 64 percent of the total enrollment of all the non-public schools in Hawaii. Findings show that the value and quality of secular education in non-public schools, judged by student performance on national tests, is positive and significant when scored on the School Achievement Index at the elementary level and positive at the secondary level with respect to grade equivalent scores as compared with public school students. Since the non-public and public schools show the same pattern of achievement, problems, and dilemmas, the educational endeavor of the state should be viewed as unitary rather than binary. (MBM)",

Two approaches were used 1) in-service leadership training, with one staff member selected to participate in a 6-week training session which was focused on training school-based in-service leaders; and 2) teacher behavior improvement workshops, where small groups of Title I summer school teachers focused on developing techniques of improving their role in the classroom. In the first approach, 22 people participated and all considered the  overall value \"good\" or \"excellent.\" In the second approach 106 people participated, and 97 percent considered the overall value \"good\" or \"excellent.\" The evaluation data suggest that the small group workshop approach should be emphasized, time allotments should be reappraised, followup workshops should be provided during the school year, a workshop should be set up to train consultants, summer workshops should be in air-conditioned facilities, the possibility of offering workshops for university credit should be explored, and the teacher behavior improvement workshop should be expanded.

Eleven tables give details of these categories. Factors inside and outside the educational system which affect change are identified as educational research, school personnel, recommendations and committees, professional and extra-legal agencies and organizations, the federal government, the courts, and society.

The research subjects were 61 teacher education students at junior level, 51 at senior level, and 36  first-year teachers. Conclusions indicated that only modest differences were found in the observed behaviors of teachers consistently exposed to one of three different instructional approaches; subjects gradually asked for less information, gave more information, and decreased their expression of both positive and negative feelings as they developed their teaching skills; and the personal dimension of teachers' communication was the only dimension consistently related to various measures of school adjustment.

A questionnaire composed of 124 work attachment ideas with levels of satisfaction, dissatisfaction, and indifference was responded to by 508 staff members of a school district in Kansas. The realization that the incentive system for teachers supported theories of the incentive system for industrial workers developed by Dubin (1970) resulted in a two-tier incentive system with provisions for each of  the satisfaction levels. Minimal incentives for all teachers are found in the lowest tier. The second tier includes features important to all teachers. Satisfied teachers would receive intrinsic incentives, indifferent teachers would receive incentives related to autonomy in work and work conditions, dissatisfied teachers would receive extrinsic work features and interpersonal relations with peers and supervisor. The proposed incentive system is similar to proposed industrial workers incentive system. It can serve as a guide for further research while being of importance to an administrator's decision in distributing incentives to employees. A brief bibliography is included. (MJM)",

Associate teaching is a continuous experience of teaching under close supervision. Intern teaching is the acceptance of full responsibility of a class or classes, again under close school and college supervision. Pretenure teaching employs the students as regular teachers with full salary with supervision available on request. The supervisory positions include the participating,  clinical, and consultant teacher. A participating teacher shares his classroom and himself with laboratory students. The clinical teacher supervises students placed with him for associate teaching experience. The consultant teacher supervises two or more pretenure teachers and works in partnership with other members of a supervisory team. This program has the potential to satisfy critics of teacher effectiveness. The program results include earlier exposure to students, more careful screening of teacher candidates, and better integration of clinical experience and theory. (MJM)",

Portions of this data were presented to teachers for consideration and discussion. Teachers, with the help of a consultant, analyzed the process of interaction among students and between teacher and student. Student feedback data were collected by audio-taping student-led discussions. The six sessions dealt with issues including prejudice,  equality, stereotyping, myths, and the generation gap. Evaluation summaries of the teacher confirmed the statistical analysis that changes in a teacher's perception and attitude toward students had occurred. Further outcomes which could be expected were a) increased liking among the parties who interact, b) increased pressure for clarifying one's position on relevant issues, and c) increased pressure to implement the new planned changes.

The data used for the project were the attitudes, perceptions, feelings, and behavior of individuals within the organization. Interviews, observations of behavior both within and outside of the classroom, and analysis of this information provided the means to examine group behavior. Four major areas of concern guided the research; they were a) organizational demands on the teacher, b) needs and role expectations of the  teacher, c) conflict between member needs and organizational demands, and d) behavior patterns teachers utilize to adapt. At the conclusion of the study, data clearly indicated that teachers exhibit survival techniques in their daily work habits. The degree of adaptive behavior ranged widely.

A sample was selected from a pool of student teachers in the elementary teacher training program at Syracuse University. Each was given a lesson which was an episode from a simulation prepared by a researcher. The teacher selected five students from the class who assumed the role of Town Board and discussed five options for expenditure of money and justified reasons for the chosen option. Upon completion of the taped lesson the teacher completed a questionnaire. Basic data was obtained through analysis of the taped lesson and questionnaire. The study suggests that all teachers are not equally successful in using simulation,  and that conceptual level may be an important factor in teacher use in a simulations activity. It seems that minimally structured activities would be more satisfactorily used by high conceptual level teachers than by low conceptual level teachers. There is, however, no guarantee that the teacher will interpret or use the simulation activity for its intended purpose, and low conceptual level teachers may adapt it to suit their normal teaching behavior.

        "description":"This empirical study evaluated several factors believed to be related to job satisfaction: teachers' own attitudes toward pupil control, teachers' perceptions of their colleagues and, principals' attitudes toward pupil control. Coefficients of correlation,, t-tests of selected variables, and multivariate regression techniques were used in testing hypothesized relationships. The data was obtained from 910 teachers: 473 elementary and 437 secondary. Teacher job satisfaction was found to be a function of subculture consensus with respect to pupil control idealogy, accentuated in terms of teaching level and experience. Forty percent of the variability of job satisfaction was accounted for by using internal-reward-type independent variables. The study of teacher job satisfaction holds  several significant implications for the administrator-teacher-student relationship. Degree of teacher job satisfaction is one determinant of the social climate of the school because productive teaching-learning coexists with congruent administrator-teacher educational philosophy. Identification of those factors which influence teacher job satisfaction is most important to administrative practice, for each factor can be incorporated into the administrative process to guide the selection, management, and evaluation of instructional personnel. A bibliography is included. Appendixes contain multivariate rationale and procedures, and variable definitions. (Author/MJM)",

Interns were asked to respond at three times during their training comparing ideal competency-based programs with traditional programs. In each case the ideal competency-based program was  rated much higher. Twice the interns were asked to rate the Oakland University Programs and both times they gave high ratings. Staff members in the Oakland University Teacher Corps Project were asked to review the program's ability to achieve the goals of the project. The response was favorable in every situation. The study attests to the value of competency-based instruction. Appendixes include a response form and an observation sheet used during the study.

Pairs of either teachers, student teachers, or education students participated in the study, accepting the role of participant or observer. The participants taught a fifth grade student a mathematics lesson for three 5-minute trials, while the observer watched the participant during her task. Data from 108 subjects were subjected to analysis of variance. The results provided some support for the presence of ego-relevant attributional biases in teachers. In some instances participants appeared to show ego-defensive biases, while in other cases, participant responses were identical  to those of observers. Participants sometimes appeared to be trying hard to be non-biased and to avoid ego-protecting or enhancing attributions. This study observes the interaction of the participant and observer, to find who influences whom. Further research is needed to assess the influence of other persons upon teachers.

A survey of 34 college administrators conducted in the fall of 1970 verified the need for special programs dealing with unique philosophies and problems of a junior college. Junior college administrators from Kansas, Arkansas, Texas, Missouri, and Oklahoma were invited to a conference held at Northeastern. Other purposes of the conference were a) to determine the needs of junior colleges in employing additional faculty, b) to determine the academic and professional experiences junior college administrators were seeking in prospective faculty, c) to orient the faculty at Northeastern to the role and philosophy of the junior college, d) to meet the need for educational planning in  Oklahoma, and e) to determine the role of Northeastern in meeting the needs of the junior colleges. On the basis of recommendations made during the conference, a proposed junior college teaching program was presented to the Board of Regents of Oklahoma. It was approved and expanded enabling Northeastern to offer a master of education degree in junior college teaching. A 11-team bibliography is included. Appendixes present a survey of junior college administrators, junior college conference participants, and the current status of the program. (MJM)",

The project studied the effects of an experimental teacher training program designed to help teachers nurture creativity in their pupils during the initial year of a city school desegregation plan. A pretest-posttest control group design was employed. One-half of the teachers participated in an experimental in-service program throughout the school year while one-half did not. The sample group was composed of all fifth and sixth grade students and their teachers in the Harrisburg School District. The fifth grade contained 39 teachers and 945 pupils and the sixth grade contained 39 teachers and 887 pupils. The Pennsylvania Department of Education designed the nine 90-minute workshop programs into three parts: a) an  introduction to psychosocial issues involved in pupil creativity, b) a review of the factors of pupil creativity which are under the teachers' control, and c) the presentation of practical alternatives which are available to teachers. Teachers and pupils were tested in the fall of 1970 and again in the spring of 1971. The in-service program was well received by the teachers. All but one teacher involved in the program experimented with the ideas and materials presented. (Related Document is SP 005 641.) (MJM)",

Approximately 25 percent of all teachers hold advanced degrees, and the median salary of all teachers in the sample is $9,710. Salaries of administrators and directors range from $9,928 to $35,000 depending on the position. The problems and confusions of the  wage-price freeze have created tensions between school districts and their employees.

        "description":"The effect of teaching poetry writing on (1) attitudes toward literature, and (2) the ability to write prose was studied in four fourth-grade classes of a metropolitan elementary school (42 boys and 40 girls) from working-class backgrounds. The children were randomly assigned, two to the experimental and two to the control group. A program for teaching poetry writing was used in the experimental group, 15 half-hour lessons being given over the six-week treatment period. The control group continued with the standard fourth-grade language arts program, changed only to prove them with the same number of writing opportunities. Analysis of the data suggests that the introduction of instruction in poetry into the curriculum has beneficial side effects in terms of the subjects' ability  to write prose and their more positive attitude to literature in general. Important factors contributing to these results are seen to be: (1) the inherent qualities of poetry in terms of the unconventional freedom and scope it provides for linguistic expression, and (2) the general provision for the young school child of an alternative mode for self-expression through language.

The rules describing dialectal variation--diafeature rules--are of a different character from those proposed by most generative linguists but the rules do involve feature specifications and underlying forms, rather than a strictly phonemic approach. The major conclusions are three in number: (1) There were no significant linguistic differences between informants still living in Kentucky, those who have  lived all their lives in Uptown, and those who have moved to Uptown fairly recently. This conclusion must be regarded as tentative, however. (2) The diafeature approach to structural dialectology is practicable.

        "description":"The basic themes that polarize English educators today are discussed, and the province of the English teacher and the English curriculum is defined. The three basic themes that have polarized authorities are in English education much the same as in all other areas. Is the purpose of teaching English (1) to impart useful skills, (2) to encourage intellectual pursuits, or (3) to guide the individual toward self-discovery and self-realization? Five essentials for preparing English teachers are proposed: (1) A realistic balance of courses in literature, language, and in speech and writing; (2) At least one course in the history and development of language; (3) A minimum of two courses in the structure of English, exploring and comparing the various grammars of English; (4) Not less  than two courses in the teaching of reading, including diagnostic and remedial techniques as well as approaches to developmental reading; and (5) A more realistic program for professional preparation in which the emphasis would be on field work where theory and practice are combined. The province of the English teacher and the English curriculum is defined as: (1) to provide through literature enlightening experiences; (2) to approach the teaching of language with the surety that diversity is the rule in language usage; (3) to help the student perceive speaking and writing as conversation with an audience; and (4) to view the teacher's role as enabling the student to develop his own generalizations and values.

General aims regarded as appropriate for academic courses for British pupils in third, fourth, fifth and six years are presented. These include the development of communication skills and the enrichment of intellectual and emotional life through varied and pleasurable language activities. The point is made that the teacher of English has a responsibility to guide his students toward salutory reading experiences. With respect to composition, three points are made: (1) Teachers should spend less time testing and more time teaching; (2)  Composition work should be done regularly in the classroom; and (3) Practice and assessment should be frequent and systematic.

The point is made that there is something fundamentally wrong with the current approach in children's writing. Current books on children's writing deal only with children's writing. It is recommended that any program which aims to be efficient in the teaching of children's writing should incorporate and exercise as part of its methodology those modes of writing which are appropriate to life outside the school. The kinds of change recommended for children's writing education are those which would instill in a child: (1) a deeper awareness and understanding of himself, (2) a wider and deeper sympathetic understanding of others, (3) a fuller understanding of his own position in time and space,  (4) a fuller awareness and understanding of the living (non-human) world, (5) a more highly developed and refined aesthetic awareness, and (6) the ability to express these appropriately. Illustrations of writing which portray some of these qualities are given. Different types of writing are also discussed. These include personal, impersonal, and imaginative. (CK)",

These were independent study and and elective course for non-college bound high school seniors. Students taking independent study were asked to write behavioral objectives outlining the intended direction of their projects. Because students were not indoctrinated adequately, they wrote inane objectives. In the other experiment, teachers wrote the objectives for the various projects. Then the non-college seniors selected the projects they wished to and/or needed to work on. It was found that the stereotyped underachiever performed well with precise direction while his capable counterpart foundered with his freedom.

Areas treated include rationale and full descriptions of the programs, self-imposed evaluation, and suggestions for expansion of the program. The university speech methods course has endeavored to meet the challenges provided by the secondary school classroom in speech communication. In October 1970, a workshop was held on the campus of a university in which students then enrolled in the speech education methods course performed as instructors. The workshop differs from the traditional forms in several respects. No effort was made to attract schools with existing programs in speech and schools with very limited programs were solicited. No effort was made for the workshop format to coincide with any  state-wide extra-curricular speech events. Basic principles of four areas of speech communication were covered: public speaking, theatre, oral interpretation, and debate. Each area was supervised by a faculty member; however, much of the teaching and debate was conducted by students from the speech education course. During the Fall quarter, 1970, speech education students at Eastern Illinois University began a speech activity program with students in the university laboratory school in grades 7, 8 and 9. Lab school students participated in oral interpretation, broadcasting, theater, and other speech events during the year. Student-teacher ratio was 1:1. Speech education majors received ample exposure to working with students individually on performance oriented activities.  (Author/CK)",

        "description":"Research findings on the subject of spelling have been compiled in this paper to assist individuals attempting to improve their effectiveness in the classroom. Investigations in spelling instruction have shown wide differences among students in all classes. These differences point to needs for classroom organization and instruction methods that will permit teachers to meet individual needs within their classrooms. Two major responsibilities of teachers of spelling are, first, wise choice of words to be taught, and second, application of effective teaching methods as they teach the selected words. Selection of words should be based on child and adult usage. These words have been largely determined by a series of well-conducted studies. Research in methodology has produced  information that should be used by teachers as they organize for and decide on methods of instruction. The findings tend to support the following conclusions: (1) Children learn to spell many words in an incidental way as they study other subjects; (2) The column, or list, approach is more efficient than is the context approach; (3) Study steps have been determined which are helpful to children when they learn to spell a word; (4) The test-study-test approach is superior to the study-test approach from the middle of the third grade on; and (5) Children benefit from learning only a few spelling rules. Continued attention is recommended in the areas of spelling reform, application of past research and proven study steps and individualized instruction. (Author/CK)",

These programs are often not relevant to the needs of many students. The point is made that educators often transmit to students values which are often those of a dying culture; one of the more important shortcomings is that some unrealistic speech programs do not prepare the students for democracy. It is stated that teachers often support student repression or remain tacitly in agreement, and fail to promote freedom of speech on controversial subjects because of fear of the school administration. It is proposed that speech teacher educators teach the theory and knowledge  concerning intra-interpersonal communication as part of the education of future secondary speech teachers. This emphasis on interpersonal communication should be aimed at the future speech teacher's perception of what a teacher is. His ability not only to understand the theory of interpersonal communication but to practice it should be developed. (Author/CK)",

It is recommended that: (1) Literature anthologies commit themselves to fair and balanced inclusion of the work of non-white minority group members; (2) Illustrations and photographs present as accurate and balanced a picture of non-white minorities and their environments as is possible in the total context of the educational materials; (3) Dialect be appropriate to the setting and characters; and (4) Literary criticism draw as heavily as possible from the critical writers of non-white minorities.

        "description":"A distinction among evaluation, measurement and reports of terminal behavior is presented. For the purposes of evaluation, any response to a speech performance provides useful feedback to the communicator. In addition to the teacher's evaluation of the performance against \"established standards\", it is argued that a teacher's subjective responses should be combined with more extensive use of peer evaluation and self evaluation. All of these forms of feedback provide subjective but relevant sources of information about the communicative act. None of these should have any bearing on the teacher's accountability to the educational system or the student's course grades. With respect to measurement, the point is made that even if a valid and reliable measurement of speech performances  were possible, it would be undesirable in terms of other course objectives ascribed to by most teachers. While refinement of measurement techniques should be continued for the improvement of written examinations and speech contests, the only measurement of classroom performances should be explicit and objective. For purposes of behavioral outcomes, accountability for instruction may be established by a description of the processes a student goes through, and course grades may be determined by reporting the student's investment in the course in terms of the performances for which he receives credit. Performance contracting, process-concept grids, and other techniques are suggested as means for minimizing measurement and maximizing useful evaluation teacher accountability.  (Author/CK)",

Objectives are: (1) to provide some measure of the frequency of censorship incidents experienced by a sample population of teachers of English, and (2) to describe the incidents. Censorship is defined as the withholding of a cmmunication from one person to another. This study focuses on that form of censorship which proscribes or restricts the use of specific books in the public secondary school English curriculum. The censorship pressures to be described are those put upon the teacher of English as he considers, recommends, selects, or uses works of literature and other pertinent  books in his professional capacity. Conclusions include: (1) English teachers who were the object of censorship pressures were objects because they were doing a good job of teaching English; (2) Those teachers who reported censorship experience often were ones who used practices which supposedly help to prevent censorship attempts; (3) In half of the instances reported, the would-be censors were parents; and (4) The major burden of defense against censorship must be carried by the teacher.

        "description":"The research reported here was designed to measure the abilities of school-age children to form and generalize &quot;visual concepts&quot; on the basis of their observation of prepared sets of art reproductions. The art reproduction sets displayed similarities based upon various visual attributes. Discrimination of the attributes common to any given set was taken as evidence of concept formation. Selection of similar reproductions in additional displays was taken as evidence of concept generalization. Additionally, tape-recorded discussions of the test administrations were analyzed. These discussions yielded additional evidence of successful test performance (on a verbal dimension) and were useful in describing the character of children's abilities to discuss the visual attributes of art  reproductions. Evidence gathered indicates that students at all grades (except, possibly, kindergarten) are able to form visual concepts from their observation of selected sets of art reproductions. Subjects also successfully described their classification of observed visual similarities when discussing the items. Students at all grade levels are also able to generalize visual concepts to previously unencountered examples. Reliability indices, computed for both types of displays, were below minimum standards for tests used to evaluate individual performance. The obtained reliabilities were attributed to interactions of low item intercorrelations, test length, and the lack of experience among subjects with the tasks tested. (Author/CK)",

        "description":"A discussion of the age of accountability in American education is presented. The point is made that this new element is causing many educators to think more precisely about their goals, how they can be achieved, and how they can determine the degree to which they have been achieved. State laws are appearing and school policies are being defined in response to the demands for accountability. In the past, quality in education has been described as input--numbers of teachers, courses, and dollars spent. Today, students, parents, and taxpayers are concerned about output--the results in terms of actual student learning. Several responses have been made to the demand for accountability. One has been performance contracting with private firms. This contracting is viewed as a means of  strengthening the public schools. Another response is to give the consumer a choice of schools from which he can receive educational services. The voucher plans and alternative schools springing up across the nation may introduce a measure of competition and increased effectiveness of schools. All the various responses to accountability involve a demand for specified learning outcomes. Implications of the accountability movement for speech education include: (1) The curriculum must be re-evaluated; (2) Criterion-referenced measurement systems must be introduced. It is concluded that the education profession must be held accountable for results and that evaluation must receive top priority on the list of educational goals. (Author/CK)",

The specific recommendations which flowed out of the conference reports differed widely because the topics at the 15 different conferences were diverse. Four clusters of recommendations which were shared by more than one conference were extracted, however. These related to teacher education, to interdisciplinary  cooperation, to increasing student contact with bona fide art objects or producing artists, and finally, to film-making and other processes whereby visual images can be reproduced, transported, isolated, or compared for educational purposes.

        "description":"A systematic study of the composition and dispersement of Title I projects assigned to elementary schools in Philadelphia was conducted. Categorical variables were identified from four major derived variables (program density code, school aggregate fund, pupil service component, achievement-growth differential score) and four major demographic variables (school staff, average daily attendance, per pupil and per teacher expenditures). Content analysis of the four program densities revealed (a) that four distinct implementation patterns (models) existed and (b) that the thrust of each model was programmatically different. The four implementation models were identified as (1) Educational/Cultural Enrichment Experiences; (2) General Instructional and Supervisory Support System; (3)  Intensive Instructional and Supervisory Support System; and (4) Remediation Programs. Assessment of Pupil outputs provided by each model indicated that although significant differences were present between the grades, the anticipated levels of output were not achieved. However, six rational procedural alternatives for increasing the capability of the schools to increase their achievement levels within each model are provided. Findings suggest that traditional evaluation techniques are not suitable for assessing the programmatic effect of, or for developing operational management information about federal programs.

A solution to the problem of generalizability is illustrated empirically on data from a set of tests designed to measure facets of response styles and of personality dimensions. Parallel sets of measures based on personality scales defining each of seven factors were separately factored. Independent sets of component scores derived from the orthogonal least squares fit to the oblique factor pattern matrix were computed, and these component scores were intercorrelated between the two sets, yielding factor reliabilities, whose values ranged from .65 to  .85. A corresponding analysis based on scores derived from random binary data yielded nonsignificant factor reliabilities ranging from -.12 to +.07. It was recommended that such a test of factor generalizability be incorporated routinely into factor analytic investigations, particularly those employing Procrustes-type rotations. (Author/AG)",

        "description":"In a comparative evaluation of a standard true-false format for personality assessment and a forced-choice format, subjects from college residential units were assigned randomly to respond either to the forced-choice or standard true-false form of the Personality Research Form (PRF). All subjects also rated themselves and the members of their residential units on behavior traits corresponding to the PRF scales. Reliabilities of the scales comprising the true-false form were substantially higher than those in the forced-choice form. Peer rating validities for the true-false and forced-choice forms were in a comparable range, but correlations with self-ratings were higher for the true-false form. Results do not support the contention that for personality scales a forced-choice  format is consistently more valid than a standard format. Considering the other advantages of the true-false format, including its freedom from the complicating effects of ipsative scores, the use of this format is recommended for the great majority of applications in personality assessment.

The concept of sensitivity is introduced as an appropriate method for evaluating such measures, and a sensitivity index is proposed. The traditional model for the response of a subject to a measure is extended to conform to the typical objective-based measurement situation, and suggestions for using this response model for evaluating the sensitivity of a measure are offered. Alternate versions of the response model, designed to account for a variety of measurement situations, are presented, along with a discussion of the role of item selection and the effect of guessing in the evaluation of the measures. Data from a  variety of sources (both empirical and simulated), which was used to study the effects of varying test parameters on the sensitivity of the measures, and the implications of the results of this data are discussed. General considerations for test development, possible uses of the proposed sensitivity index, and recommendations for further research conclude the report. (AG)",

Agreement among raters was sketchy at the start of the rating, but improved dramatically with practice. It was concluded that (a) Classifying objectives is a useful procedure by which to evaluate the communicability of objectives; (b) Of all aspects of an objective, the verb is probably the most important; and (c) Reading objectives are no more difficult to classify than are objectives in other instructional  content areas.

The results indicated that when the ratio degrees of freedom (axb)/degrees of freedom (within) was large (1/4), pooling resulted in a disturbance in the actual alpha for the main effect test. The magnitude and nature of the disturbance was dependent on the alpha level employed in testing the interaction effects. The use of an alpha of .25 for the interaction effects resulted in a congruence between actual alpha and nominal alpha, and a slight increase in power. (Author/CK)",

Fifty subjects, matched for pretest score on a double classification task, were randomly assigned to either training or control (no training) groups. Within the training group, subjects matched for pretest score were assigned at random to either of two trainers. Training was given both on CFR and NFR (Convergent Production of Figural Relations). Posttests were administered covering CFR, NFR, DFR (Divergent Production of Figural Relations) and ERF (Evaluation of Figural Relations). Training subjects significantly  outperformed control subjects in CFR with both taught and untaught logical relations. The two trainers differed in effectiveness. For the better trainer, transfer was obtained within NFR and to EFR, but not to DFR or to Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices as a measure of CFR. Transfer effects held up three months later.

Basically, the strategy employed to meet these needs was to offer an educational program that was both attractive and relevant to the residents. The Preschool Program provides both day care service and increasing achievement. The Extended Day Activities appear to be accounting for an additional increase in attendance above that created by the rest of the Model Cities Projects. The Communication Skills Laboratories are increasing the abilities to communicate and understand communication in Model  Neighborhood Area students who were even more deficient than their peers to begin with. The Community Schools have provided a range of innovative classes, from those classifiable as enrichment through those that are vocationally oriented. The pupil service provided under the heading of Teacher Pupil Services was that offered by the social workers and attendance aides whose primary objective is to increase attendance. (Author/JM)",

It seems clear that delays under the \"all deliberate speed\" doctrine, or by other means, will no longer be permissible. Staff and teacher desegregation is mandatory in most school districts undertaking to desegregate their schools. \"Freedom-of-choice\" plans, as a tactic to delay or as a desegregation plan, are no longer considered as realistic means of achieving meaningful school desegregation. Financial assistance will no longer be given to those districts which fall below the minimum standards set by the Department of  Health, Education and Welfare. Ability grouping, although not concretely decided upon yet, will not be sustained, as declared in the \"Hobsen v. Hansen\" case. More and more courts are recognizing the right to transfer. Finally, in the de facto segregation area, although not decided upon by the Supreme Court yet, many lower court decisions have suggested a strong trend toward requiring school officials to desegregate their schools, even if the segregation is caused by factors outside the jurisdiction of school authorities.

To carry this out, the Laboratory School staff during the year 1970-71 attempted to create forums and dialogues designed to assess school needs as seen by parents, interested community groups, and school and university personnel, and to develop and initiate programs designed to meet those needs. University of California at Riverside (UCR) students and teachers attended the Laboratory  School workshops designed to meet specific needs of teachers in two Riverside elementary schools. In some cases, cooperating teachers and their UCR student teachers worked together in establishing innovations such as personalized reading programs with special attention to meeting needs of the ethnically different child. In essence, the Laboratory School activities constitute a &quot;case study,&quot; the tracking of which is best done by close attention to the interrelated attitudes and goals of all participants.

The purpose of the Columbus Public Schools in planning the language component was based on the assumption that the language of disadvantaged children prevents their dealing successfully with the school program. The Language Development Component was designed to extend the communicating skills of speaking, listening, reading, and writing so that component participants might attain the educational level appropriate for children of their age and grade level. The program was implemented directly through special instructional services and activities in the language skill areas. Other efforts to achieve the program goal  were directed toward home and parent involvement, and toward in-service programs for component teachers. Language development units established in eligible elementary schools consisted of three or four regular kindergarten or primary classroom teachers and one language development teacher. Each unit served up to 35 children, for approximately 60 minutes per day, 5 days a week. Two to four such units functioned in each school. (Author/JM)",

The pre-kindergarten child should leave the program feeling important and unique and should have gained language, social, and motor skills which enable him to be successful in kindergarten and first grade. The curriculum of the program was developed by the classroom teachers and social workers in the program. It included instruction in vocabulary development, social growth, gross-and-fine-motor coordination development, number concept development, music, art, and literature. The involvement of parents in the program was considered  essential. Parents were encouraged to visit the classroom for observation and conferences with teachers. The teachers visited in the home to discuss the child's progress with the parents. There were 659 pupils enrolled at some time during the year and 487 remained during the entire year. Each child attended school for four half-day sessions per week. Each session accommodated between 12 and 18 pupils.

The design of the component was based on the assumption that many pre-school disadvantaged pupils have underdeveloped potential in many areas necessary for success in early grades. These are areas such as oral language, vocabulary, visual perception, and auditory discrimination. Each classroom was staffed by a teacher, teacher assistant, and community volunteers to work with 15 children at each session, one morning and one afternoon, five days each week. The component also included health care and parent meetings. Inservice training included consulting concerning strategies for teaching  pre-reading skills to four-year-olds. The curriculum included activities with toys and games, sociodramatic play, and outdoor equipment. These activities were designed to stimulate the child's senses, help develop extended, more accurate language, and develop enthusiasm for learning. The evaluation strategy was constructed around pre- and post-testing with the Bettye Caldwell Preschool Inventory, which indicates whether progress was made in the development of the child's perceptual abilities and oral language skills related to the school environment.

Thirty public schools of the Columbus Public School District and four Diocesan schools were served by this component. The curriculum included numerous activities under the categores of motivation, motor activities, visual discrimination, auditory perception, listening, sight vocabulary,  word analysis, comprehension, phonics, and study skills. There was consultation with classroom teachers about individual pupils. Pupil selection was made on the basis of a comparison of obtained versus expected reading scores on the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test--for fourth graders, or the Nelson Reading Test, for fifth or sixth graders. The 35 pupils who demonstrated the largest discrepancy and who were also below age level were selected for further diagnosis and instruction. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"A national indifference to children is indicated by the system of foster child care and by the treatment of mental retardates. Another manifestation is the attack on Head Start. Criticism based on the program's failure to raise standardized intelligence or aptitude scores is misplaced. Head Start is a broad developmental program having many components. Approximately 40 percent of children coming to Head Start centers have an identifiable physical defect. Over 75 percent have had their defects treated. The author asserts he is proud to have been one of the architects of Head Start, for which was enunciated the principle of parent participation. Through such participation, one sees parents getting a new sense of dignity and a new sense of being able to control their own destiny and  that of their children. In 58 communities where Head Start was available, it changed their health and education delivery system. Head Start is directed toward improving the social competence of the child, rather than toward massive IQ changes. The children's centers of the seventies should provide both a variety of services for children on a full-day rather than half-day basis, and the means for mixing children of different socio-economic groups.

The auxiliary services component included the Aide Training Program, Job Placement Service, Santa Clara Liaison, Nelles Typing, School Psychologists, Libraries, and Adaptive Physical Education.

A specific proposal, H.R.1, eliminates food stamps, the Nation's primary antihunger program, as a form of a food assistance for families choosing to take part in the new welfare program. The Food Stamp Program is eliminated through the mechanism of a so-called &quot;cash-out&quot; provision in H.R.1. That is, the bonus food stamp benefits formerly provided in food coupons may now, if a State so chooses, be provided to families in cash at levels in effect in January 1971. Additionally, under H.R.1, participating families  will remain eligible for the Federal Surplus Foods Program, if such a program exists in their area. The elimination of the Food Stamp Program in the form of a &quot;cash-out&quot; raises many questions regarding the national commitment, expressed by the President, the Congress, and the people at large, to end hunger and malnutrition among poor families in America.

The educational data presented in this report relate to the number of school years completed by the population and do not provide any information on the quality of the education received. It has been found that the proportion of the adult population who had completed at least a high school education increased by 16 percentage points during the decade of the 1960's to 60 percent. This increase was slightly greater for men than for women. The proportion of Negro adults who had completed at least a high school education was 40 percent in 1971 as compared with 24 percent in 1960, about a two-thirds increase. The comparable figures for whites were 62 percent  and 45 percent, respectively, or a one-third increase. Among younger persons who would have more recently completed their high school studies, those 20 to 29 years old, the proportion who had completed at least a high school education increased between 1960 and 1971 from 65 percent to 82 percent for whites, and from 40 percent to 62 percent for Negroes. In addition, the proportion of high school graduates 20 to 24 years old who had completed some college also increased for both Negroes and whites over the past decade. (Author/JM)",

The four purposes of the plan as originally stated are as follows: (1) to relieve serious overcrowding at the May and Spencer Schools; (2) to promote stabilization through the Austin Area; (3) to increase desegregation in District Four; and, (4) to improve the educational experiences of all children. It has been found that black pupils integrated into classes with white pupils have achieved at a higher level academically than do their counterparts who remain in the segregated schools. White pupils did not suffer any loss in academic achievement as a result of the busing program. Principals and teachers in  schools receiving black pupils believe that the busing program has demonstrated positive educational results. White children from segregated white classes have gained in achievement at a normal rate after the busing program (integration) has been effected. Black children continued to gain (academically) at a lower rate of achievement in segregated black classes when they remained in such classes. (Author/JM)",

Numerous statistical data are given. Some districts reported a month-for-month growth in reading and mathematics in four or more grade levels (Long Beach, Los Angeles, Sacramento, Santa Ana, and Stockton Unified School Districts and Modesto City Elementary School District), while other districts reported a month-for-month growth at three grade levels (Fresno, Oakland, and San Bernardino Unified School Districts and Compton City Elementary School Districts). Brief district profiles of these comprehensive programs are  given for Long Beach, Los Angeles, Modesto, Sacramento, Santa Ana, Stockton, Compton, Fresno, Oakland, and San Bernardino. Also given is a District Profile of the successes and failures in each of the required components and the district advisory committees. (SB)",

Effective comprehensive planning must begin with an honest estimate of the desired output. Title I and Model Cities are two parallel programs sponsored by the Federal Government which seek to give help to the poor and the socially disadvantaged in the inner cities. Changes in the educational process are brought about by programs designed to engage community involvement, the introduction of early reading experience into kindergarten, compensatory education for all children in need of it, and programs to improve neighborhoods. While these two programs parallel each other, it is necessary that services are not duplicated or  counter-productively competitive. State and Federal agencies must be ready to assist communities requesting aid or consultation, and the efforts of State and Federal offices should be fully coordinated. (Author/SB)",

At the completion of the first phase, forty trainees were chosen for continued training as paraprofessional community organizer-planners, with particular emphasis on the area of housing renewal and redevelopment. After graduation, trainees work with the Corporation and other local agencies interested in planning and planned change.

The aim of this compensatory program was to develop an infant education curriculum with a strong cognitive emphasis, but based in the initial building of a firm foundation of sensory-perceptual abilities as a prerequisite step. The early childhood intervention program attempted to reconstruct an environment of educationally disadvantaged children which educationally incapacitated them before they entered school. This attempt was significant in that it tried to start such compensatory training in a structured manner at  ages younger than generally thought practical. Covered in this report are: (1) a review of related research; (2) the rationale of the program; (3) program activities; and, (4) an evaluation, including subjective and objective results as well as conclusions.

Sexual social distances are larger for boys than for girls, increase during pre-adolescence, and decrease during adolescence. Racial social distances are larger for blacks than for whites, and increase with age. Across grades, blacks attribute relatively greater social distance to racial than to sexual differences, whereas until high school, whites ascribe relatively greater distance to sex than race. By the third grade, children of both sexes and races believe that sexual social distance is smaller between blacks than whites, and by the fifth grade, believe there is less racial distance among females than males. Subjects at all grade levels  believe social distances are largest when race and sex vary simultaneously. The results are discussed in relation to socialization theory and American acculturation patterns. (Author)",

All of the children, teachers, and staff in these schools were black. For comparison, two white middle-class schools and one white working-class urban school were also studied. The primary method used was systematic non-participant observation. In all, more than 306 classroom observations were made--242 in black classrooms and 64 in white--each observational period being approximately ninety minutes. There were 180 home visits of 28 families. Supplementary data include interviews with  teachers, principals, staff personnel, superintendents, and members of the school board; observations of teachers' meeting and parent teacher association meetings; informal conversations with teachers, principals, and children; and, materials such as report cards, classroom work, displays, office memos, children's drawings, public reports on the school system, and the like. By documenting the processes by which educational failure is assured for many children, it is hoped that points of possible change will be suggested to reduce the casualties.

        "description":"Project Stay is a demonstration project of the St. Louis Public Schools, funded under Title VIII of Public Law 90-247, with several programs concentrating on reducing the number of dropouts. The project has the purpose of identifying students who are potential dropouts, determining their individual needs, and developing programs to meet those needs. Six components offer services and activities specifically designed to help students successfully participate in school activities in a manner which would lead to future employment and a rewarding and successful adulthood. The components consist of: work-study programs; increased guidance services; continued education opportunities for pregnant girls; social adjustment classes for students who have difficulty adjusting to the regular  classroom environment; instructional and curriculum revision; and, an extensive program of after-school activities. During 1969-71, the project was located in Enright Middle and Soldan High Schools. It will be expanded to include Clark Elementary School during the 1971-72 school year. It was found that, during the second project year, the number of dropouts from Soldan was reduced by 49.8 percent from the baseline year to 22.1 percent over the first project year. Enright had no dropouts during the year. (Author/JM)",

While contemporary movements are geared toward offsetting some of the consequences, e.g., black self-determination, black power, and black control, blacks, in general, are still faced with the dilemma of identity (personality) development within a society dominated by the institutionalized norms and values of the \"intellectual colonizer.\" Current educational systems, in order to be relevant, must be geared toward: (1) a consciousness which demonstrates concern for quality versus quantity; (2) a consciousness which places emphasis on human outcomes versus inputs; and, (3) a consciousness which  deemphasizes product outputs. In addition, Black Studies can be instituted to meet the specific needs of a black society. Educational outcomes for the future should be geared toward facilitation of individual capacity for decision-making in the presence of substantive options. (Author/SB)",

Black History should help students develop the ability to make reflective decisions so that they can resolve personal problems and shape public policy by participating in intelligent social action; the goal of Black History should be to help students become effective change agents.

HRD is an adult and continuing educational process designed to help alleviate some of the adult problems of today with the hope that the future will be more rewarding for all. Today, changes in social and technological conditions are proceeding at such a rapid pace that everyday skills as those involved in child-rearing, food preparation, transportation, health maintenance, and leisure time activities are constantly being modified. The increasing necessity for a mobile population coincident with concentrated living in cities requires adults to learn new patterns, values, and new ways of achieving personal identity repeatedly within a single life-time. Therefore, there is a new  emphasis to educate adults as well as children. However, HRD Departments must be not only concerned with recruiting and training adults to function at present, but must address themselves to problems of the future, such as rural America, the universities, and the poor semi- or unskilled, semi- or illiterate poor people, and minority groups.

Bias is defined as an item by race interaction in an analysis-of-variance design. The sample of 172 third graders at two integrated schools in a large California school district, included 26 white students, 20 Blacks, 64 Mexican-Americans, and 37 Orientals. In order to obtain the initial information about item by race interaction, the Stanford Achievement Test, Paragraph Meaning subtest was used. Item regression data for six racial pairings were inspected: Whites/Blacks; Whites/Mexican-Americans; Whites/Orientals; Blacks/Mexican-Americans; Black/Orientals; and Mexican-Americans/Orientals. Various methods of establishing the  existence and nature of test bias are discussed, with the conclusion that test bias cannot be conclusively demonstrated in a wholly satisfactory manner. One method was nontheless selected and applied to test items administrated to two field-test schools for the purpose of investigating bias. The results of that small-scale study are discussed, but do not offer compelling reasons for the observed racial ethnic differences. (Author/LS)",
