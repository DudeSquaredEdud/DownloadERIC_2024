        "description":"This study explored the relationships among age, gender, depth of sport experience, and coincidence anticipation performance for 42 children 3- to 9-year-old from high middle and socioeconomic backgrounds. The task involved observing light illumination moving down the track of a Bassin Timer. Depth of sport experience was evaluated by the amount of involvement in competitive sports. Results indicated that there are gender differences: (1) in when children begin to have greater depth of experience in sport; (2) in the pattern of the quality of coincidence anticipation performance; and (3) in the pattern of consistency of coincidence anticipation performance. The patterns suggest that involvement in, and depth of, sport experience related to coincidence anticipation performance  quality and consistency, and that depth of sport involvement early in the 6- to 9-year age ranges seems to be important.

The Center's work combines case studies of different teacher education programs with longitudinal studies of participants' learning. Putting together data about the purposes, character, and quality of programs with data about how teachers and prospective teachers' ideas and practices change over time enables the Center to address the central research question: What do teacher education programs contribute to teachers' learning? This paper describes how the Center is exploring that question and what may be learned from the investigation. A discussion is presented on how the key terms in  the research question are conceptualized and a description is given of data collection strategies. Some of the contributions and limitations of the Center's research are discussed. (JD)",

The comparison was made in terms of the types of innovation undertaken, the local implementation process used, and the impact of the reform on school climate, teachers, students, and ongoing capacity for change at the local level. Specifically, the comparison of the two strategies focused on: (1) what content areas were addressed, what type of students were targeted, and what methods of instruction were pursued; (2) in what ways the people at the school conceived of,  and implemented, the process of change; and (3) how did the innovations affect student outcomes, staff morale, or the capacity of the organization to make ongoing changes. Findings indicated that: (1) top-down strategies are effective for implementing comprehensive reforms; (2) the bottom-up process is most effective for unique programs targeted to specific student needs; (3) bottom-up changes are difficult to institutionalize within the regular program; and (4) top-down strategies must include bottom-up participation.

While research shows individuals who misbehave perform poorly in school, it has not made clear why. Further, the evidence on order and achievement at the school level is even more limited. One inference drawn here is that failure to distinguish order as a product of coercion from order as a manifestation of self-disicpline may result both in the failure of research to clarify the relationship between order and achievement and in the failure of schools to foster their highest purposes.

The paper adopts an organizational view of schools which suggests that instruction is the school's \"core technology,\" occurring when teachers apply available resources such as time and curricular materials to the exigencies of classroom life. Two aspects of instruction, the use of time and the coverage of curricular content, are discussed in detail. But the paper also acknowledges that instruction occurs in a social context, which must be specified if one wishes to analyze schooling rather than pedagogy. Finally, an empirical example is presented to illustrate the formulation and to suggest further ways of measuring instruction. (Author)",

Careful analyses were conducted of state laws in Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington to find out what these laws require in the area of student assessment training. Assessment course offerings in the most prominent teacher training programs in the region were examined to determine how frequently teachers are offered training in assessment and exactly what they are taught. The goal of the study was to determine teacher training priorities in the Northwest and to compare those findings with the results of a decade-long study of the task demands of classroom assessment. Discrepancies between the real assessment needs of teachers and the  needs addressed (or not addressed) in their training programs suggest policies in need of reexamination, certification requirements in need of review, and teacher training curricula in need of revision.

        "description":"This study, conducted at a laboratory school connected with the University of Pittsburgh, examined student perceptions of teaching competencies of both master teachers and intern teacher trainees. The trainees were graduate students participating in a Master of Arts in Teaching degree program. Two primary classrooms (comprised of a multi-aged grouping of first and second grade students) assessed the competencies of the master teachers as well as the trainees. The Student Perception Instrument of the Teacher Performance Assessment Instruments assessed two areas: (1) competencies in classroom procedures; and (2) competencies in interpersonal skills. The results supported the conclusion that primary aged students do not discern the gradation of teaching competencies of novice and  master teachers. It is suggested that perceptions of young children may not be reliable for the evaluation of teaching competencies. (JD)",

        "description":"This study intoduces a strategy for analysing different kinds of phenomena by building \"information structures\" for analysing how parts make a whole in complex systems. The strategy introduced may be of use when there is a need to understand complex systems or situations; e.g., in various studies of adult education when education is seen as closely related to individual and environmental issues. The paper introduces some areas of research where this approach could be applied; in conceptual analysis, theory building and research design, analyses of change, historical studies, decision making, innovative studies, and in educational planning and assessment. Data from an earlier study on supervisory behavior in teacher training as assessed by student teachers is used to give an  example of how to build an information structure and how to use this information in building conceptual models for general and individual descriptions of a behavior. An example is also given of how to apply an information structure called Dynamic Concept Analysis in studies of change. (JD)",

The survey reveals that moonlighters are more likely to be male, are somewhat younger, and have less full-time teaching experience than their non-moonlighting counterparts; secondary school teachers are more likely to moonlight than  elementary school teachers; and while there is no salary difference between school-year moonlighting and non-moonlighting teachers, summer-recess moonlighters earn somewhat less under their primary contracts than summer-recess non-moonlighters.

Academic teachers must undergo a change in attitude toward the vocational-technical (votech) students and the careers they pursue. It is suggested in this paper that information concerning vocational education should be incorporated into the preservice teacher education courses in foundations of education. Preservice exposure to votech education would encompass three parts: (1) an orientation, including specific reference to the application of each of the educational foundation areas to a votech education; (2) a tour of a votech school; and (3) a wrap-up debriefing following the votech school visit. In addition to educating preservice  teachers about votech education, there is a need to educate inservice teachers. Most important would be the education of secondary teachers who are called upon to teach English to votech students. A description is given to a 3-week period inservice program that has been successful in enlightening teachers on the career choices open to votech students.

        "description":"Results from the fall 1987 administration of the Cognitive Skills Assessment Battery (CSAB) to 3,203 kindergarten and 4,415 first-grade students within the Charleston County (South Carolina) School District are presented. The CSAB is an individually administered readiness test that comprises a hybrid of aptitude tests, diagnostic tests, and achievement tests. The CSAB measures readiness for first grade prior to movement to that level, assesses 12 of 18 statewide kindergarten objectives as part of the Basic Skills Assessment Program, provides detailed instructional information about each student's performance on each objective tested, and measures some previous learning. The CSAB requires 20-30 minutes for administration to each child. It is not a paper-and-pencil test; rather, it  is composed of orally-administered items to which the child usually responds by pointing to pictures, manipulating objects, and answering questions orally. This report presents: (1) district-wide results for both grade levels; (2) comparisons of district results with state results for first graders; (3) breakdowns of the district's first-grade results by demographic characteristics of the students (including gender, ethnicity, handicapped status, repeater status, income, and kindergarten experience); (4) historical results for district first graders for 1985, 1986, and 1987; and (5) percentages of district first grade and kindergarten students scoring ready, borderline, and not ready on each CSAB objective for 1985, 1986, and 1987. District CSAB data demonstrate an increase in readiness  levels among entering first graders; although, readiness scores between 1985 and 1987 have remained relatively constant for the district and state. The greatest relative increases from kindergarten to grade 1 appeared for ordering and fine motor skills; however, objectives analysis for these two grades show a leveling effect. (TJH)",

        "description":"Project Advancement Based on Competency (ABC) was a 5-year study funded jointly by the Alberta Department of Education and the Calgary Board of Education for the sum of $999,950. The study extended from 1982 to 1987, exploring alternatives to the Carnegie Unit in three senior high schools in Calgary. The Unit was established in 1907 to regulate the distribution of college pension funds, but quickly came to standardize the quality of high schools. Project ABC provided the three schools with the opportunity to remove the fixed time-credit relationship and to replace it with continuous progress based on individual competency. This study assessed student achievement, curriculum adherence, removal of time as a credit requirement, competency as the basis for awarding credit,  considerations for provincial applications, and budget considerations. Three independent models evolved from the project: (1) the Department-based Model; (2) the Parallel Core Program Model; and (3) the School-wide Model. Student achievement overall was generally comparable to non-project student achievement within the Calgary Board of Education and the Province of Alberta. Few significant differences were identified. Provincial curriculum was adhered to in individualized instruction and continuous progress formats, and in some cases, it was found to be superior. Results suggest that the criterion of time can be removed and replaced by the criterion of demonstrated competency and that competency is an appropriate basis for advancement at both unit and course levels. Results of a 1932-40  study in the United States, analyzed during a literature review, indicated that personalized instruction and continuous progress are viable educational alternatives and should no longer be considered experimental.

Birnbaum. An alternative program, BILOG, developed by R. J. Mislevy and R. D. Bock (1983), has recently become available. This paper compares the approaches taken by the two programs and offers some initial guidelines for choosing between the two programs for particular applications. An application of the two programs to two simple simulated data sets is illustrated, wherein responses are assessed from simulated examinees to a 45-item artificial test comprised of three replications of 15 four-choice items. It is recommended that: (1) the user with short tests and/or small examinee samples consider using  BILOG due to its incorporation of formal Bayesian procedures, while LOGIST performs better with longer tests and larger samples; (2) LOGIST can produce joint maximum likelihood estimates, while BILOG can produce marginal maximum likelihood estimates; and (3) neither program alone can produce finite and reasonable parameter estimates.

Using substantive theory to differentiate the likelihoods of response vectors under a fixed set of solution strategies, responses are modeled in terms of item parameters associated with each strategy, proportions of the population employing each, and the distributions of examinee parameters within each. Posterior distributions can then be obtained for each examinee, giving the probabilities that they employed each of the strategies and their proficiency under each. The ideas are illustrated with a conceptual example about response strategies for spatial rotation items, and a  numerical example resolving a population of examinees into subpopulations of valid responders and random guessers.

        "description":"Two major groups of researchers focus on identifying schools that have been unusually effective in terms of their students' achievement: (1) &quot;effective schools&quot; researchers; and (2) those charged with the responsibility of identifying schools for special recognition. However, all legitimate attemps to operationalize school effectiveness that are based on student achievement (i.e., those controlling relevant extraneous variables) have produced &quot;measurements&quot; that do not have desirable properties. For example, these measurements are quite unstable across different school subpopulations (such as students in different grades) and across years. This finding is counter-intuitive. In this study, eight alternative methods were used to &quot;measure&quot; the effectiveness in reading and  mathematics of a sample of 135 elementary schools in South Carolina across grades 1 through 4 for the 1985-86 and 1986-87 school years. The eight student samples ranged from 8,000 to 11,000 children. Scores from the Basic Skills Assessment Programs and the Cognitive Skills Assessment Battery served as pretest measures. Four of the methods might be considered traditional, whereas the other four do not seem to have been considered previously. The results indicate that one of the new methods, based on hierarchical linear modeling, produced school effectiveness indices that were slightly more stable across grades and considerably more stable across years than the more traditional methods. Although several technical and political issues remain unresolved, this approach to the identification of  exceptional schools should receive further consideration. Three tables of correlations are included. (Author/SLD)",

The NCQ measures eight non-traditional or non-cognitive variables that relate to minority student retention--positive self-concept, realistic self-appraisal, understanding and dealing with racism, preferring long-range goals to short-term or immediate needs, availability of strong support person, successful leadership experience, demonstrated community service, and knowledge acquired in a field. As it has been reported that the original eight variables could be related to particular aspects of academic success among minority and non-traditional students, it was determined that stress-coping  abilities might be correlated with the NCQ. The construct validity and congruent validity of the NCQ were further established by studying its correlation with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), a stress-coping measure, and correlating new and original NCQ items. The study involved administration of the NCQ and the PSS to 251 incoming 1987-88 freshmen attending summer orientation sessions at the University of Maryland (College Park). Data were analyzed via a principal components factor analysis, using squared multiple correlations as communality estimates, and varimax rotation of all factors with eigenvalues greater than one. Several original NCQ variables correlated highly with both new NCQ items and the stress questionnaire items. One table presents construct and congruent validity data  for the NCQ and PSS. (TJH)",

It was found that the revised instrument adequately represented the data. Tests of the invariance of the factor structure obtained on the initial black samples compared to a second black sample of 97  students and a sample of 202 white students revealed that the factor structure held across samples. It was concluded that the revised instrument was content valid and that the scales were stable and invariant across race. Five data tables are presented. (TJH)",

Separate analyses were made for White (n=471), Black (n=54), and Asian (n=96) subgroups, as well as for the total sample of 643 students who entered the pharmacy school at a large eastern university between 1975 and 1986. The results indicate that the predictors differed significantly in importance for the three subgroups. In a separate analysis, the eight variables within the Noncognitive Questionnaire were examined with respect to their predictive power when included in an equation with pre-pharmacy GPA and PCAT total score. One of the non-cognitive variables--understanding and  dealing with racism--significantly increased the overall R squared value. It should be noted that the sample size for this study was quite small, limiting both the validity and generalizability of the findings. The small sample size also undermined the attempt to distinguish results across racial groups for the non-cognitive variables. Implications for educators and admissions personnel are discussed. Two data tables provide demographic characteristics of the subjects and results of multiple regression analyses. (TJH)",

The series has been assembled to provide school districts with a relatively inexpensive test development method. The series is designed to reduce costs by pooling resources in terms of training and instrument development. Although many of the concepts presented can be used for informal, daily classroom assessment, the main focus is the development of more formal assessment systems (unit, year, or course-end tests) and/or diagnostic systems. The three workshops include an introductory session, a session on developing test specifications, and a item pool development session. The two workshops not outlined  cover pilot testing and finalizing assessment materials. The entire series is designed to occur over a period of 1 year or more. Each workshop presents information and practice on one step of the test development process. Participants then finish that step before they proceed to the next workshop. At the end of the series, participants have one or more instruments pilot-tested and ready to use. Although many of the instruments are multiple-choice, other formats are encouraged as appropriate. Presenters' outlines, participant handouts, and copies of transparencies are provided for each of the three workshops. Samples of letters to participants are appended. (TJH)",

Data provided by 69 students at a private university in the southern United States were used. Both forms of the FEFT were administered in counterbalanced order to different subjects; 36 subjects completed Form A, and then Form B. Specifically, the study was designed to compare: (1) the alpha coefficient reliabilities of data from the two administration formats; (2) test and item difficulty data across administration methods; and (3) corrected item-total correlation of discrimination coefficients across test administrations. Results are contrasted with those of a  previous study involving a multiple-choice &quot;selection&quot; format administration of the FEFT to 302 subjects. The alpha correlation associated with scores of the 69 subjects on Form A was 0.66 and that for Form B was 0.83. In terms of test difficulty, Form A scores ranged from 16 through 32, and Form B scores ranged from 13 through 34. Form A items were more likely to behave differently across administration formats. Both the selection- and supply-format administrations of each form had positive discrimination coefficients. The two FEFT forms provide data with reasonable reliability and psychometric integrity. The FEFT may assist researchers who want to use a selection format to measure field independence. (TJH)",

Three models were fit to the data from these subjects using the LISREL VI computer program. All models involved extraction of maximum-likelihood estimates of structures based on analysis of correlation matrices. Two of the models fit the data nearly equally well.

Subjects were 291 graduates of teacher certification programs at a major university in the southeastern United States from Fall 1986 through Summer 1987. In an initial survey concerning employment, 88.6% of the subjects responded. A second follow-up was conducted that requested more detailed information, including evaluation of the teacher preparation program and career plans. A total of 227 subjects (78%) responded. Sixty-four subjects did not respond, and most of these non-respondents could not be contacted. Data were also collected from analyses of subjects' college records. Chi-square  tests comparing respondents and non-respondents on employment, major, status, date of graduation, location, and gender revealed no significant differences for these variables. Non-respondents tended to be older than respondents, but no significant differences were found for grade point average and scores on the American College Tests and the National Teacher Examination. Since the survey had a 78% response rate, it was encouraging to know that respondents were representative of the entire sample. Two tables provide the results of chi-square and Mann-Whitney comparisons of the study data. (SLD)",

Subjects included 59 males and 84 females (aged from 10 years 2 months to 13 years 9 months). Principal factor analysis was conducted to determine whether the 48 items of the four subscales measured the traits suggested by their placement on the scales. Three factors emerged from the analysis. The first was tentatively labelled mathematics anxiety or lack of  confidence. The second was made up of items on the ATSMS, and the third included almost all of the items on the EMMS.

Focus was on determining the demographic context for mathematics achievement in Mississippi. Data from the 1986-87 District Profile Sheets compiled by the State Department of Education were analyzed. The Basic Skills Assessment Program tests in grades 3, 5, 8, and 11 and the Functional Literacy Examinations served as the dependent variables in this study. Summary statistics were obtained for 68 variables, including information on the county of residence, demographic and economic information on the school district, and average test scores of the district. Correlational and regression analyses indicated that economic factors and the educational environment of the district  were the best predictors of mathematics achievement. The greatest difficulties in basic mathematics skills were: (1) computational skills beyond whole numbers in the elementary grades; (2) problem solving in the secondary grades; and (3) metric conversions in the elementary grades. The results for Mississippi were similar to, but somewhat lower than, those reported in the fourth National Assessment of Educational Progress. It is contended that Mississippi is fortunate to have tests keyed to the specific objectives in the state curriculum, making evaluation easier to conduct and more specific. Specific plans for progress can be developed from the determination of district variables associated with weakness or strength in mathematics. Five tables present study data. Objectives and an  analysis of district profile sheets are appended. (SLD)",

The 25-34 year age group served as the target sample for this study; the mean scores for adults in each educational category, within each age group, were weighted to match the educational distribution of ages 25-34 years. After weighting for education, the decline in verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) from age to age disappeared. However,  declines across the 20-74 year range remained for performance IQ and full scale IQ, even after controlling for education. These results were also obtained using multiple regression techniques. The impact of education on each of the 11 subtests was also evaluated; the results were interpreted as supportive of J. L.

A Reflective Teaching Instrument (RTI) was developed around three dimensions of reflective practice in teaching: (1) diagnosis (problem setting); (2) testing; and (3) personal causation. Indicators of each of the dimensions were compiled from a review of the literature to generate an instrument. Four educators comprised an expert panel that assessed the face validity of each item. The pilot instrument of 48 Likert-format items was administered to 40 practicing teachers enrolled in graduate classes. A field test was subsequently conducted with 102 public elementary and junior high school teachers, representing a response rate of 94%. Items empirically supported  through factor analysis after the field test were retained, resulting in a revised 15-item scale. Reliability coefficients of the revised scale indicated that items appeared to measure the identified constructs. Further research should include refinement of the instrument with attention to the diagnosis subscale, which was of somewhat suspect construct validity. Research to support the relationship between scores on this instrument and teacher effectiveness is also needed. Factor structure and alpha reliability data of the RTI are tabulated. (SLD)",

Subjects were 47 undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory biology course at either a public university or a smaller private university in the southern United States. The subjects completed a measure of critical thinking skills in biology, the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal, the Group Embedded Figures Test, and the American College Tests.

It was established that: (1) computer-based and paper-based measures (i.e., test score and average degree of confidence) are not significantly different in reliability or internal consistency; (2) for computer-based and paper-based measures, the average degree of confidence has a higher reliability than does the average response latency, which in turn has a higher reliability than do the test scores; (3) a few of the  findings are ambivalent since some results suggest that equivalence estimates for computer-based and paper-based measures (i.e., test score and average degree of confidence) are about the same, and another suggests that these estimates are different; and (4) the discriminant validity of the computer-based measures was superior to that of the paper-based measures.

Seven tables present study data. (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"This study investigated the nature of field independence by exploring the structure underlying responses to Forms A and B of a multiple-choice measure of field-independence, the Finding Embedded Figures Test (FEFT). Subjects included 302 students (52.7% male) enrolled in mathematics courses at a university in the southern United States. Students completed both forms of the FEFT (each form contained 35 items) or one form of the FEFT and the Group Embedded Figures Test, with different orders of test administration. A total of 225 students completed Form A of the FEFT, 232 students completed Form B of the FEFT, and 155 students completed Forms A and B of the FEFT. Results suggest that the perceptual disembedding manifestations of field independence involve several dimensions,  although these dimensions may be subsumed by a common higher-order factor. Results also support the conclusion that the research edition of the FEFT has reasonable psychometric integrity. Eight tables provide percentile equivalent scores, factor structure matrices, and item characteristic maps of the study data; and a 48-item list of references is included. (Author/SLD)",

However, it has been suggested that the canonical correlation coefficient is positively biased. A Monte Carlo study involving 1,000 random samples from each of 64 different population matrices was conducted to investigate bias in both canonical correlation and redundancy coefficients, and to provide an empirical basis for isolating an appropriate correction formula. Results indicate that the Wherry correction, first suggested for use with the multiple correlation coefficient, provides a reasonable correction that is sensitive to those factors most affecting  bias. The results also indicate that canonical results are not as positively biased as some researchers have believed, especially if sample size is at least 10 subjects per variable or effect sizes are moderate or large.

The manner in which these techniques may be integrated to provide a unified and comprehensive treatment of scientific theory development is demonstrated. In particular, the means by which experimentation is used to empirically guide and verify the analogy-derived theory formation stage and by which analogy is used to initiate and focus experimentation-based theory revision is demonstrated. Furthermore, a general protocol for communication between theory formation and experimentation-based revision is outlined. Experimental queries using the protocol are motivated by empirical questions and requirements encountered during hypothesis generation and evaluation. Theoretical  queries are motivated by the need for plausible hypotheses during experimentation-based theory revision. The usefulness and generality of the protocol is demonstrated by an implementation integrating two previously autonomous systems: (1) PHINEAS, which performs verification-based analogical learning; and (2) ADEPT, which performs experimentation-based theory revision. The application of this protocol is described for the discovery and revision of models for evaporation and osmosis. (TJH)",

Racial differentials in mobility within the United States are seen as evidence of the lack of assimilation of blacks into the American mainstream. This paper tests for a convergence over time in racial differentials in local residential mobility and migration. Tabulations of the 1940-80 Public Use Microdata Files of the U.S. Census and corresponding loglinear models are used to examine changes over time in the interaction of race and mobility, while controlling for the influence of age, education, and southern origin. Results reveal that effects of age, education, and time period on the distribution of  persons among mobility types are substantial. With the exception of those who have attended or completed college, blacks tend to remain less migratory than whites at all times, even after controlling for age and education. However, evidence does exist for the reduction of these differentials over time. A list of 25 references is included.

Data were analyzed from interviews conducted in each school with the principal, assistant principals, a counselor, teachers and department heads from a variety of departments, and a high- and low-achieving ninth or tenth grade and senior student. Additional interviews were conducted with central office staff in each city. Major variables explored include the following: (1) district characteristics; (2) school characteristics; (3) interactions among teachers and students; and (4) teacher and student commitment.  Major findings include the following: (1) student and teacher commitment are closely interrelated; (2) factors which affect the commitment of both students and teachers include relevance, respect, support, expectations, and influence; and (3) each of these factors can be reflected in a series of programmatic and administrative actions at both the district and the school level. Recommendations for ways to adjust these school and district factors to build commitment are included. Illustrative material is included on nine figures. A list of references is also included.

Principal findings include the following: (1) remedial education greatly increased; (2) needs assessments were generally adequate; (3) while remediation serves some school dropouts (four percent), it is targeted to younger in-school youth (43 percent were under 16 years old), with many from welfare households (34 percent); (4) while pre- and  post-program test results indicated gains in skills, overall program effectiveness could not be determined; and (5) overall program reductions were significant but anticipated due to the cost of adding the remedial programs.

JEDI is a voluntary program whereby states receive additional funds to fight the problem of chronic welfare dependency and poverty. The bill would require the existing Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) to target job training efforts at long-term and potentially long-term welfare recipients. States that participate would get bonuses from the federal welfare savings for placing long-term welfare recipients in unsubsidized jobs and helping them stay employed for either one, two, or three years.

        "description":"Puerto Rico, although Hispanic, Roman Catholic, and conservative about women's role, has one of the highest divorce rates in the world. Puerto Rico's divorce rate has increased substantially since the process of industrialization began. This study analyzed 300 Puerto Rican women divorced between July 1980 and May 1981. Findings indicate that they are young, have completed more years of education than their ex-husbands, and have surpassed the mean educational attainment for the general population. Of the women, 65.5 percent lived in urban areas, 73 percent were heads of households, and 80 percent had from one to three children. The fact that 51% of these women are participating in the labor force and that they occupy higher positions in the work structure than their ex-husbands  contradicts the findings of earlier studies. A higher educational and employment status appears to be associated with better psychological well-being. High levels of home stress, job stress, and role overload seem to be associated with lower levels of psychological well-being in the women. By contrast, the greater the income satisfaction reported by the divorced woman, the more enhanced her psychological well-being. Despite the stresses and changes that divorce entails, 75 percent of the women said that they would repeat the experience if the circumstances were repeated. Data are presented on six tables and figures. An 11-item list of references is included. (BJV)",

        "description":"This study examined the following predictors of academic success for 4,113 Asian American students and 1,000 White students who enrolled as freshmen on any of the eight University of California campuses during fall 1984: (1) high school grade point average (GPA); (2) Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT)--verbal score; (3) SAT--mathematical score; (4) English Composition Test score; and (5) Level I or Level II Mathematics Test score. These predictors were measured against the following variables: (1) ethnicity; (2) major; (3) language spoken; and (4) gender. Among the findings were the following: (1) high school GPA and SAT or Achievement Test scores can, to a moderate degree, predict university freshman grades of Asian American and White students; (2) for both Asian Americans and  Whites, the best single predictor is the high school GPA; (3) for Asian American students, but not for White students, mathematics scores are a better predictor than are verbal scores--this ethnic difference persisted regardless of academic major or English proficiency; (4) no major sex differences were found; (5) the various Asian American groups showed some differences in the regression equations; and (6) the White regression equation underpredicted the performance of Chinese, other Asians, and Asian Americans who said that English was not their best language, and overpredicted those of Filipinos, Japanese, and Asian Americans for whom English was the best language.

        "description":"The 1982-83 school year was the second year of the New York City (New York) Public Schools Promotional Gates Program. Under this program students in grades four and seven who failed to attain their promotional criteria (in both reading and mathematics) were retained for a year of intensive remedial instruction. This report is the result of a longitudinal study of these &quot;Gates&quot; students. Findings are presented in the following areas: (1) student achievement; (2) attainment of the seventh-grade criterion (for the fourth grade students); (3) progress towards high school graduation (for the seventh-grade students); and (4) participation in the Attendance Improvement/Dropout Prevention Program (AIDP) and the Dropout Prevention Program (D.P.P.). The majority of the Gates students made  significant gains during the Gates year, particularly in reading achievement. Unfortunately, after the Gates year, students received few, if any educational or social services to assist them in building on these gains, and they failed to continue to make adequate progress. Recommendations for improving the Promotional Gate Program are offered. Data are presented on 24 tables and figures. (BJV)",

Planning must also include the loss of an urban labor pool as the mobile  unemployed move to new locations in search of jobs; and the immobile chronically unemployed, who require social services.

        "description":"Homelessness has emerged on the public agenda of economically advanced nations but not all such issues become recognized as &quot;legitimate&quot; social problems. National politicians and policymakers have an interest in defining the problem narrowly in order to avoid response and implied criticism of existing policies and institutions. Local officials and social agencies prefer a broader definition in order to obtain resources for policy and program implementation. This paper examines the progress of homelessness as a social issue in Canada. Chapter 1, &quot;The Politics of Defining a 'New' Social Problem,&quot; discusses how politics, not the &quot;objective reality&quot; of homelessness, determines its status on the public agenda. Chapter 2, &quot;Two National Governments: The U.S. and Canada,&quot; compares the  debate over the definition of homelessness in the two countries, and demonstrates the extent to which the governments are attempting to narrow that definition. Chapter 3, &quot;Local Initiatives: Three Examples from Toronto,&quot; reviews the following recent studies by local government and social agencies in Toronto (Ontario): (1) Metro Toronto's Study of the Homeless; (2) The Social Planning Council of Metro Toronto; and (3) The Single Displaced Persons Project. Chapter 4, &quot;The Future of Homelessness as a Social Problem,&quot; discusses the following common themes in the definition of homelessness: (1) national scope; (2) long-term duration; (3) complex, multidimensional nature; and (4) the need for political commitment.

        "description":"This paper examines the economic push factors encouraging migration from the Caribbean Basin to the United States, as part of an assessment of the effectiveness of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. The basic assumption is that much of the migration is motivated by a desire to improve economic circumstances, and that the nonavailability of jobs in the native country is the key to the strength of this motivation. The growing imbalance between labor supply and labor demand in the Caribbean Basin is examined, utilizing alternative assumptions about how rapidly labor demand is likely to increase in the future. The implications of rising unemployment for migratory pressure are then discussed. The jobs that would have to be created, in addition to those expected to be  generated by the continuation of present policies in order to achieve a variety of postulated job targets, as well as the projected costs of creating these additional jobs, are estimated. The major conclusion is that long-term solutions to the problem of rising joblessness in the Caribbean must focus on continued fertility reduction and on accelerated efforts towards economic development. Statistical data are included on 18 graphs, 3 tables, and a map. The appendix consists of 15 tables of labor projections and cost estimates. A list of 48 references and a 25-item bibliography of related titles on the impact of immigration in California are also included. (FMW)",

        "description":"This study attempts to measure the degree of assimilation exhibited by various immigrant groups, as indicated by their residential patterns. Ecological models of assimilation hold that immigrants are highly segregated from the majority population upon arrival, but that segregation declines with time in a process of residential assimilation. The general residential segregation of 13 ethnic groups, which vary in terms of immigrant proportion, was analyzed in Los Angeles (California) and San Diego (California). A more detailed analysis of ethnic segregation by year of immigration and citizenship status was performed for Los Angeles. Both analyses used metropolitan census tract data from the 1980 census. Results partially support the general models of residential assimilation.  However, there was not a strict association between recency of immigration and the degree of segregation exhibited by the group. Immigrant assimilation occurs within an ethnic context. Further immigration to the United States is not likely to create immigrant ghettos or a residentially distinct underclass, because group ethnic identity appears to far outweigh immigrant status in determining segregation patterns.

Bidwell's goal was to use PALS to teach large numbers of adults who read below the fifth-grade level. Every effort was made to implement the PALS program strictly as outlined by IBM. However, the center conducted 15-week cycles rather than the recommended 20-week cycles, with open entry. The computer lab, which cost approximately $50,000, was sectioned into three major work stations. Students used INfo-window stations, a double-sided instructional videodisc, a work journal, word processing stations, and a typing program. Students who  tested at grades 2-4 level at the beginning of the program fared best, advancing an average of 1.7 grade levels by the end of the program. Students below this level were little helped, but would have been screened out by IBM. Bidwell concluded that PALS can be an effective tool in teaching adults to read and write, but suggested both improvements to the program and ways to incorporate PALS into a holistic instructional approach using phonemics, linguistics, language expression, structural analysis, and multilevel comprehension techniques.

        "description":"A combination of crises and innovative attempts to manage them that began in 1980 transformed the relationship between Xerox Corporation and the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union, which represents most of Xerox's manufacturing employees. Eight pivotal episodes were largely responsible for the transformation. The first was a joint decision to establish a program of employee involvement in corporate decision making. The second event was the hard bargaining and joint decision making that began two years later in response to Xerox's decision to subcontract about 180 jobs. Next came the institutionalization of joint decision making, which was in turn followed by the plateauing of volunteers for the formal employee involvement process. The fifth critical episode was the  gradual emergence of pockets of worker autonomy on the shop floor and the consequent accommodation on the part of the formal system of contractual rules and managerial procedures. After this came changing patterns of strategic decision making, resource allocation, and information sharing. A corporate-wide effort to transform the managerial culture was the seventh pivotal event. Finally, there were the 1986 negotiations that continued the corporation's no-layoff policy and the exploration of new forms of rewards and recognition. (MN)",

Chapter I is an overview of the displaced worker problem. It considers the extent of worker displacement and job loss and summarizes future projections. Chapter II discusses existing programs for displaced workers. These federal programs are described: Job Training Partnership Act programs (including program elements, participation factors, and barriers to program implementation), Trade Adjustment Assistance, and the Employment Service. A section on nonfederal programs focuses on private sector programs, state programs, and community college and vocational-technical school projects. Chapter III offers recommendations as  guidelines for actions that educational leaders and program designers can use to strengthen the capacity of educational institutions to serve the needs of adults in job and career transitions. It recommends that (1) educational institutions link with other community agencies; (2) the linkages should include information-sharing mechanisms to facilitate advance notice and early intervention; (3) private industry councils, vocational schools, and colleges should aggressively develop and market displaced worker, retraining, career advancement, and job search programs; and (4) educational institutions should focus on services that they can best provide.

        "description":"Although educators know that older persons bring experience, curiosity, and motivation into the educational setting, they often do not consider the aged to be engaged in development, especially in the development of trust. Education can provide for older persons a means for focusing on society and self. The classroom can serve as a stimulus to creative thinking; discussion, as a catalyst for the individual undertaking a new task in life. The opportunity to reflect and socialize creates pronounced energy. This energy, in turn, sustains the learner in the process of self-discovery, for each older learner brings his or her own agenda to the adult education classroom. However, the adult education format also can be used to integrate elders into the community, to give them the  opportunity to share themselves and their wisdom, and generations that will follow them. Educational experiences designed for older persons could include (1) activities based on reminiscence; (2) activities based on vocational redirection; (3) activities designed to teach coping skills; (4) education as empowerment; and (5) participation as education. Adult education can take the lead in creating experiences in which elders are given the opportunity to explore their developmental agenda. At the same time, elders can teach those who come after them how to trust. (KC)",

        "description":"The national movement for educational reform that began in the 1980's has largely concentrated on improving the educational services provided to high school and preschool students. It is equally important to help elementary and middle school children and young adolescents at risk develop the social and basic academic skills needed to function at home, at school, and in the community. A study examined educational research and programs that have concentrated on coordinating public and private resources to help these students build these skills. The study resulted in eight recommendations. It was concluded that (1) program planners should concentrate on building leadership and social skills among middle grade students; (2) adult participants in programs involving young adolescents  should be trained to understand the dynamics of early adolescent development and multicultural factors in attitudes and behavior; (3) children and youth at risk should not only be provided with a wide array of supportive services but should be afforded opportunities to provide services to others as well; and (4) public school systems serving high concentrations of high-risk youth should create policies encouraging maximum flexibility and responsibility for decision making at the school building level.

        "description":"This monograph provides empirical evidence of the effects of advance notice. Chapter 1 summarizes theoretical arguments for and against plant closing legislation and the evidence of the extent to which advance notice currently is provided to displaced workers in the United States. Chapter 2 presents a summary of prior empirical research on the effects of legislated, privately bargained, and voluntarily provided advance notice of displacement in the United States and Europe. The next four chapters contain new empirical research, which uses the Bureau of Labor Statistics 1984 Survey of Displaced Workers and other data sources. Findings are that having advance notice appears to reduce the probability that a displaced worker will suffer any spell of unemployment, but that it has no  effect on the individual's duration of nonemployment if he/she becomes unemployed or on the individual's earnings if he/she becomes reemployed. Contrary to concerns of critics of advance notice, no evidence is found that advance notice leads a firm's most productive workers to quit prior to their planned displacement date. Chapter 7 discusses implications of these findings for public policy toward displaced workers. It addresses inducements that the federal government might use to encourage employers to provide advance notice voluntarily and types of research that should be undertaken to help evaluate the effectiveness of the new federal legislation.

Firm characteristics make a difference not only with regard to the kinds of skills wanted by employers but also with regard to how training can best be delivered. The distinctive features of large, small and medium, and micro enterprises must be taken into account when developing employer-relevant training programs. Formal training institutions are generally restricted in their ability to respond to employer-related training needs. Most successful training programs are flexible in terms of the content offered, methods of instruction, and mode of delivery. Establishing linkages between training and  employment is considered essential to successful program planning. Educational planning is most responsive to labor market needs when it is done locally, and local planners need local data. Planners must fully consider the larger political, economic, and social context. A program's success will depend on a set of interrelated conditions fostering program stability, efficient use of resources, long-term development, and effective links with employment. (MN)",

The study concluded  that the nationwide surplus of qualified agriculture teachers continued for school year 1986-87. The study recommended that national supply and demand research should be continued in agricultural education as a valuable tool for projecting the need for agricultural teachers. Further research also was recommended into the background and characteristics of agriculture students and their career goals to provide planning information. (KC)",

A structured approach should be based on research, educational theory, experience, and the best thinking that can be found. To be successful, an induction assistance program must be a collaborative effort, accepted and supported by local administrators and teachers. Education faculty members at the local university also need to be involved. They can examine alternative solutions being tried throughout the country and evaluate them for possible implementation. At least one other group must be involved--the teacher professional organization. Members of specific teacher professional organizations have the program expertise and experiences that the beginning vocational teacher  lacks. Under the leadership of the state vocational organization, members of the respective affiliate vocational teacher organizations should provide that experience to beginning teachers. Finally, a series of professional development centers should be created and professional development local coordinators should be hired to aid preservice and beginning teachers. An improved induction program will lead to better teaching of vocational education subjects. (KC)",

        "description":"Vocational educators have been making notable efforts to serve students with disabilities for many years. For more than 20 years, federal legislation has sought to facilitate such efforts by requiring that a portion of federal funding for vocational education be set aside to serve handicapped students. Disabled students can be educated either by mainstreaming them into the regular education system or by putting them into special education. However, mainstreamed students often lack assistance from special educators, and vocational educators cannot provide the services these students need. Because of this problem and the way that accounting systems for funding are set up, many school systems have arranged special programs of career/vocational education for students with  disabilities. These programs offer employability training, special work experience, and separate instruction. However, these programs cannot provide the occupational training that vocational education does. What is needed is a program based on cooperation between vocational and special education departments. A unified system of service delivery is essential to providing exemplary vocational education for disabled students. Only when significant steps are made toward this goal will there be improvements in the level and quality of participation by students with disabilities in vocational programs. (KC)",

After three years of the Career Development Program (CDP), the California Achievement Test scores of students in the school units were analyzed to see if their teachers' career development program made a difference. A control group of 15 units comparable to the CDP group also was analyzed in order to clarify which effects might be attributable to career development. The test showed more improvement in the CDP units than in the match units. For example, at grades 3, 6, and 8, the number of CDP units scoring below the  national median declined, whereas most match units continued to have scores below the median. In addition, more than 63 percent of the CDP units experienced growth in each grade over the period, whereas in the match units, the corresponding percentage never exceeded 50 percent. Improvements in achievement were more widespread in the CDP units. Finally, sixth-to-eighth grade scores improved for the CDP units more than for the control units.

Another focus was the setting of instructional goals compatible with industrial needs and skills. Success of the instructional process was measured by student application of skills and knowledge in other situations. Manufacturer input was solicited for design of the training equipment to ensure the actual use of the machines within the manufacturing industry. Computer-assisted instruction  was recommended for training for flexible manufacturing systems. The project itself used an image process camera to aid the student learning through a simulation. Computer-assisted instruction was found to be necessary to train students for the computer-integrated manufacturing systems being adopted by the manufacturing industry. (YLB)",

        "description":"A model of adult education appears to function in the outreach programs of three Columbus (Ohio) performing arts organizations. The first tier represents the arts organization's board of trustees, and the second represents the internal administration of the company. Two administrative bodies are arbitrarily labelled as education and marketing, which may or may not exist as separate entities in each organization. The responsibilities of these units or of the general administration encompass a wide variety of education activities, both formal and informal. The third tier of the model represents the personnel who carry out (and sometimes receive) education and training. For performing arts companies, marketing, or any promotional activity, is seen as having an educative function in  that it increases awareness of and knowledge regarding the arts. Although education is seen overall as secondary to performance, it is seen as a vital component in the promotional activities related to the performance. Educational activities are described as important in the efforts of audience building and attracting funding and sponsorship. The future of the three companies is dependent on accessibility to the art. Arts education is a key to lifelong learning, leisure activity, and a mutually beneficial relationship between the performing arts and the host community. (YLB)",

This chapter also addresses the controversy regarding formal versus informal assessment. &quot;Encouraging Nontraditional Options&quot; (Louise Vetter) indicates that much of the available research focuses on student recruitment into nontraditional programs. &quot;Single Parents and Homemakers&quot; (Louise Vetter) identifies the comprehensive services needed for an optimal program for this group.

A planning group from the organization organized the study and created a survey. The study was configured around four components: (1) determination of the availability of data in each state for the series of research questions in the implementation study; (2) an assessment of successes, problems, and recommendations regarding implementation of the Perkins Act; (3) selected vocational education data requests--to gather data from each state  on vocational enrollments, number of programs, number of eligible recipients, and number of economically depressed areas; and (4) key examples of effectiveness of the Perkins Act. Preliminary results from mailed surveys of these four areas suggested that vocational education is providing needed services and programs and that the federal aid they have received through the Perkins Act is critical to that success. The NASDVE, therefore, appealed for continuation of vocational education funding. (KC)",

At the same time, it is struggling with its own maturation and development as a profession. Specific trends and issues emerge from this context, one group related to the profession and another related to adult education programs. At the heart of the issue of how and why the field should professionalize is the question of whether adult education should seek professional status similar to medicine and law or develop a new model of professionalization. A related issue is certification of practitioners. Debate concerns determination of appropriate proficiencies and of an appropriate credential and credentialing body. Emerging ethical issues include differing opinions  over the establishment of a code of ethics. Another trend is the study and interpretation of adult education history. Adult learning is one of the most thoroughly investigated areas in the field. Considerable movement has occurred in access and equity and in adult literacy education, particularly as they relate to the development and delivery of programs. Access and equity issues focus on the question of who participates and what barriers deter participation. New emphases in adult literacy include policymaking and development of programs targeted to specific populations. (Includes 72 references.) (SK)",

        "description":"The need for partnerships among deliverers of training in the public and private sectors has reached a critical point if U.S. businesses are to remain competitive. The work force and workplace are being transformed by demographic trends, economic and employment trends, a growing skills mismatch, and concerns over educational effectiveness. Two responses to the changes are de-skilling of jobs and reorganization of work. Responses of the public and private training sectors to these problems and to collaborative efforts for solving them are affected by the history of private sector influence and involvement in job training policy. The failure of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act led to greater emphasis on joint public-private efforts in the Job Training Partnership Act  (JTPA) and Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act. The rationale for public-private linkages encompasses the arguments that they can improve national competitiveness and productivity, increase equity in access to employment, and enhance local economic development. Existing forms of collaboration provide guidelines for further attempts to build partnerships. Recommendations call for a greater investment in public education, reorientation of federal vocational education programs, modification of JTPA performance incentives, stronger federal support for public-private training initiatives, and public awareness.

They include the need to predict personnel needs, social and demographic trends, changing nature of work, changing types of jobs, equity, productivity, technological change, and organizational philosophies. Career development is important at every step in the management cycle, the system by which employees join, grow, and develop within an organization. It is a system consisting of all of those programs and tools used to support the entire management cycle. The career development model can be divided into three phases: staffing, evaluating, and developing. Creation of a career development program first requires an assessment of the organization's need for career development. After needs  assessment, the developer must create a vision of what the career development should be, initially including all possibilities. Next, an action plan must be developed. The final step is evaluation of the program and revisions, if necessary. Many research opportunities still exist in the field of career development in such specific areas as integration of career systems with other organizational systems, objectives-based program evaluation, and effects of organizational cultural variables.

        "description":"Vocational education providers need knowledge of trends and critical issues in order to prepare workers for the future. The context of vocational education and training programs is greatly influenced by social, economic, and technological forces to which they must respond. Among the most important social trends are the following: (1) increase in minority populations; (2) increase in nontraditional families; (3) aging of the population; (4) changes in life-style; and (5) changes in the culture of the workplace. Technological forces having an impact on vocational education include changes in skills and skill levels of workers resulting from technological changes and the transformation of the workplace into a learning environment. Related economic trends are the change from a  manufacturing to a service economy, increased international competition, and growth of small businesses. Three major trends in vocational education have emerged in the 1980s: an impetus for reform; changing administrative and instructional roles; and access to vocational education. Within the framework of these broader trends are specific issues confronting vocational educators, in such areas as at-risk populations, teacher preparation, basic skills improvement, dropout prevention, program articulation, public-private sector linkages, technology as an instructional medium and as subject matter, emphasis on higher-order thinking skills, academic credit for vocational education, and vocational education at the elementary school level.

Representatives on the task force included public health leaders from academia, state agencies, city and local health departments, public health associations, and individuals with extensive experience in the area of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The group concluded that extraordinarily high unmet training needs exist among public health professionals, both in schools of public health and in the field. Identified needs included monitoring the epidemic, setting local policy, and coordinating the delivery of public education and services to those at highest risk. These roles require appropriate training of  health department staff in the areas of AIDS education; the design of culturally sensitive interventions; interpretation of data concerning the epidemic; and the development of policy and planning strategies for addressing the future course of the epidemic. The task force submitted 31 recommendations for increased training in the following areas: (1) state and local health departments; (2) community-based providers and organizations; (3) schools of public health; and (4) government and legislative initiatives.

Representatives on the task force included health care administrators and public health professionals and educators and members of various health, hospital, and educational associations. The task force found that the AIDS epidemic is challenging a health care system that was unprepared for it. It also found that health administration professionals are often in key decision-making positions with  respect to AIDS treatment, but that little systematic attention has been paid to the impact of AIDS on health services organizations and managers. It was noted current legislation does not specifically address the AIDS-related educational needs of health care manager. Key issues that the group discussed included general management, cost/financing, and legal/ethical issues related to AIDS. The task force made a number of recommendations for continuing education for health care managers. (KC)",

Specifically, the study attempted to analyze and describe the SPS responses of counselor trainees; to examine whether SPS elements, styles, and processes varied depending on the type of problem; and to determine the influence of individual differences on the SPS of counselors. Protocol analysis was used to determine how subjects solved ill-defined interpersonal, intrapersonal, complex, and simple problems. Problem situations were scored for eight SPS elements (e.g., strategy, evaluation), three SPS processes (sequential, holistic, simultaneous), and three SPS styles (analytical, affective,  behavioral). Results indicated that subjects used more analysis and evaluation of self on intrapersonal problems, while employing more evaluation of strategies on interpersonal problems. On simple problems, subjects used more strategies, elaborations, and problem statements, while on complex problems they used more analysis, evaluations and feeling statements. (Author/NB)",

Overall results of the review are summarized in a section on findings and an evaluation summary table gives the final scores each program package received on each evaluation criteria used. The findings section notes that: (1) 11 of the 18 programs were linear tutorials with very little branching and all of the tutorials were very text-intensive, requiring a considerable amount of reading; (2) most of the packages did a fairly good job of stressing the  harmful effects of alcohol and other drug use, but legality of alcohol and drug use was addressed in only a few instances; (3) none of the programs were intended to be comprehensive for all grades; and (4) programs received low scores for supplementary materials which accompanied the program disk. The products reviewed were rated as good at accurately presenting content, avoiding stereotyping, and being easy to use. For each of the 18 programs, the product description section lists the program title, hardware needed, cost, copyright year, audience, a brief description, possible uses, strengths, weaknesses, and additional comments.

        "description":"Job satisfaction is highly researched in industrial and organizational psychology, and the Job Descriptive Index (JDI) is often used to measure job satisfaction. The JDI has been shown to have significant convergent and discriminant validities, good internal consistency and stability, and has been related to various personal and job factors. While most studies using the JDI have used an English version, the literature suggests that a reasonable translation of the JDI is possible. Little attention has been given, however, to the study of the relationship between job satisfaction and background and job-related variables in different cultures. This study investigated the feasibility of using a translated version of the JDI to measure job satisfaction for Korean workers and examined  how job satisfaction is related to other worker measures. Korean workers (N=417) completed a Korean version of the revised JDI and responded to a questionnaire measuring 11 demographic and 2 job-related variables. The revised JDI scales appeared to generalize, in reliability and factor structure, to the Korean sample. Job satisfaction was found to be related to workers' statements concerning their intentions to stay on the job but was not related to self-rated performance. Significant correlations were found between job satisfaction and a variety of background variables and these were consistent with findings for American workers. (NB)",

Matriculating freshmen (N=247) who were engineering and science students completed the anticipated adjustment form of the Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire (SACQ) during a freshman orientation program and completed the actual adjustment form of the SACQ in October of their freshman year. The results were consistent with findings from previous studies in that the students, as a group, experienced a substantial decrease in actual adjustment as compared to expected adjustment. Subjects showed a particularly large discrepancy in the academic adjustment category. Examination of data  from normative institutions and from this particular institution suggests that this was caused by lower scores on actual adjustment rather than by overly high expectations prior to college entry. It appeared that the engineering and science students tested in this study experienced one aspect of the freshman myth more intensely than did students in previous studies. The findings support the use of the SACQ as a measure of college adjustment for engineering and science students. (NB)",

        "description":"The social support literature lacks empirical studies addressing structural distinctions between social network ties. It often divides social support into functional categories such as material, emotional, or advice support, with little regard to specific support providers or how the support from these providers can be delineated by individuals receiving support. In this study, 125 undergraduate students used a 7-point Likert-type scale to rate how similar support providers were to each other in how they were supportive. The data were analyzed using multidimensional scaling analysis. Subjects also rated each support provider on 17 adjectives (e.g. warm, accessible, equal), and these ratings were regressed over the two principal dimensions and helped define them as \"intimacy\" and\"equality/relevance to daily life.\" The \"intimacy\" dimension primarily separated informal providers such as family and friends from providers whose interactions are more likely to be structured and organized, such as school and work personnel. The second dimension seemed to separate providers more or less likely to be involved in daily interactions with the participant, whether or not these interactions were intimate. Friends, bosses, schoolmates, and faculty were high on this dimension, while kin and doctor/dentist were low. Cluster analysis of the similarities ratings and factor analysis of the adjective ratings corroborated these results. (Author/NB)",

Only a few studies have focused on friendships between the sexes and most of these have used college student samples. This study examined friendships of 156 professional men and women using a self-report questionnaire consisting of rating scales and open-ended questions. Four types of friendships were compared: women's same-sex and cross-sex and men's same-sex and cross-sex. The results indicated that while both sexes viewed the characteristics of an ideal friendship in similar ways, their actual experiences of friendship differed. Women's same-sex friendships were rated higher for overall quality, intimacy, enjoyment, and nurturance, while men's cross-sex  friendships were rated higher in these areas (with the exception of intimacy which was rated the same by men in both same-sex and cross-sex friendships). Cross-sex friendships provided both sexes with new understandings and perspectives of the opposite sex. Though both sexes reported generally keeping friendships and sexual relationships separate, sexual feelings and tensions created dissatisfaction in a sizable minority of cross-sex friendships. These reuslts are similar to findings from studies with college students, suggesting that women's participation in professional roles has not resulted in dramatic changes in friendship patterns.

Subjects were college students enrolled in the College of Business (N=33), the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (N=100), the College of Education and Technology (N=103), and the College of Fine Arts (N=131). The responses to the survey appear consistent throughout. Cheating appeared to occur in high school but to diminish at the college level. The results suggest that, while  very few students deliberately plan ahead to cheat, they will take advantage of a situation if given the opportunity.

Demographic differences were also investigated. Data on vandalism and assaults had been gathered each school month by school districts. Each school had a minimum of 3 years of monthly statistics available on vandalism occurrences and assaults. The results revealed that the variability in vandalism and violence from month to  month was much greater than the change over time. No dramatic steady increases or decreases were found. Junior high schools had much lower frequencies of vandalism occurrences and costs than did senior high schools. Vandalism frequencies were higher in schools with a majority of white students, while assault rates were higher in schools with a majority of blacks or Hispanics. Low socioeconomic-level schools had very little reported vandalism but very high assault levels. (NB)",

Both parents participated in 206 cases, although only 174 fathers and 175 mothers completed all scales used in the analysis. Parents and students completed similar measures of general sexual attitudes, erotophobia-erotophilia, social desirability, openness and problems in general family communication, sexual knowledge, sexual communication, intensity of religious beliefs, and demographic variables. Parents also indicated how much their own parents talked to them about each  of nine sexual topics. Responses from families in which both parents participated revealed that, while openness in general family communication and previous sexual discussions with one's mother were related to communication about sex with one's own child for both parents, educational level and general sexual attitudes were related to sexual communication for fathers only. Sex of the child was related to level of sexual discussion for mothers only. Although fathers generally reported talking less to their children about sexuality than did mothers, fathers did not appear to selectively talk to sons only. Mothers were generally reponsible for discussing sexually-related topics with both sons and daughters, although mothers reported higher levels of discussion with daughters. (NB)",

The relationship between family communication about sexuality and adolescent sexual behavior, attitudes, knowledge, and contraceptive use was examined. This relationship differed as a function of gender, parental sexual attitudes, and source of information about communication. Based on student communication reports, only the sexual behavior of girls with liberal parents was related to  parent-child communication about sex, but the sexual knowledge and contraceptive use of boys with liberal parents were positively related to sexual communication with parents. Based on parent communication reports, daughters of liberal and conservative parents were more likely to be sexually active if they had talked to their parents about sex.

Major studies conducted in the United States and Canada relating eating disorders and sports/fitness activity are thoroughly reviewed and an agenda is presented for moving sports/fitness from part of the problem to part of the solution for eating disorders. The overrepresentation of eating disorders among athletes who must conform to strict weight restrictions in order to perform is discussed and well-known female athletes who  have suffered from eating disorders are identified. Anorexia among men is also described. Several tables are included which provide information to help fitness instructors and athletic coaches distinguish between features of the normal athlete/fitness participant and the athlete/exercise anorexic/bulimic. Danger signs of eating disorders are listed and features shared by both normal and eating-disordered athletes are given. The role of the media in promoting a desire for thinness is discussed and issues of dissatisfaction with body weight and body image distortion are addressed. (NB)",

This study examined clinical treatment of children in a school setting. Subjects included an experimental group of 14 second graders whose parents had been divorced 3 weeks to 1 year and a control group of 7 second graders with 2 from divorced and 5 from intact families. One-half of the experimental group participated in an interpersonal problem solving group and exposure to material specific to  divorce. The other experimental subjects participated only in the general interpersonal problem solving curriculum. The divorce content specific group exhibited significant decreases in two of the three behavioral adjustment indicators measured, somatic complaints and verbal complaints or refusals. Temper outbursts did not vary significantly between groups. Use of a control group in examining the effect of a collaborative problem solving intervention supported use of the intervention, since the occurrence of peer altercations in the school setting were reduced. Long-term effects of the intervention, if any, were not studied. (ABL)",

        "description":"The relatively simple question of whether sex differences exist has evolved into the more theoretically interesting question of why sex differences occur. This transition has come about because of the meta-analytic investigations of sex differences in social behavior which established sex difference trends in a variety of social behaviors. Many psychologists have questioned the validity of these meta-analytic generalizations since they violate many of the concepts in our textbooks and violate the popular view that sex differences exist only in the minds of perceivers. This role analysis focuses on gender roles, socially constructed rules about male and female behavior. Role theory is in harmony with the overall sex differences established in meta-analyses, tending to be  consistent with the normative expectations that women should be communal and men agentic. To account for variability in findings about sex differences, a theory should suggest moderator variables that specify social settings that limit and accentuate sex differences. Meta-analysis is suited to the detection of such interactions between sex and situational variables when the studies differ in theory-relevant aspects of their social settings. Sex differences in behavior may appear stronger in laboratory than in natural settings. Meta-analytic studies should enable development of more valid generalizations about women and men. (ABL)",

        "description":"Recently there appears to have been an increase in interest in the relative power of general ability and narrower cognitive aptitudes to predict real world performance in training programs and on the job. This area has important practical implications for personnel selection and classification, particularly for large organizations such as the United States military which assigns people differentially to jobs based on patterns of measured abilities. This study examined the ability of Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB), forms 8, 9, and 10 to predict training performance, using 10 technical jobs in the U.S. Navy with at least 900 people in each job. Performance was the measured criterion. For one job, Mess Management Specialist, performance was measured as final  school grade. The other nine technical jobs were self-paced; the criterion was the number of hours required to complete training. General mental ability alone did about as well as differential weighting at the level of the three general aptitudes (quantitative, verbal, technical). Using all 10 specific aptitude tests as separate predictors increased validity by about eight percent. Future analysis will examine the specific values of beta weights and will be testing Hunter's (1983) path models for fit to the data from individual jobs. (ABL)",

The caregiving systems of 84 of Texas's Adult Protective Services' (APS) cases were examined. The definition of neglect that was used was neutral in attribution, referring neither to self nor caregiver responsibility nor to active or passive intention. Case studies examined what caseworkers found entering the situation; what intervention was chosen; how the elder and family responded; and what the outcome was. The neglected elder is one whose needs are not adequately met in one or more of these areas: personal care, nutrition, medical care, or condition of  the environment. Whether inadequate care was due to self-neglect or caregiver neglect was not always easy to determine. Case analyses resulted in five profiles of situations and problems that describe why caregiving systems seemed to fail: (1) the caregivers were overwhelmed; (2) the elder refused care; (3) caregivers were more interested in their own gain than in the elder's welfare; (4) the caregiving system was dysfunctional due to poor relationships or difficult personalities; and (5) the elder was alone and had no one on whom to rely. Interventions ranged from caregiver support; emergency action, including forced removal; and general assistance. Caseworkers felt the most critical need was for greater resources, increasing what was already in place, more emergency funds, and more  medical services. The need for more preventive services was also emphasized. Abuse and neglect were thought to be the result of multifaceted problems which required multiagency resolution. (ABL)",

        "description":"Changes in skill requirements, training needs, the industrial and occupational mix of employment, and the spatial location of jobs are 'natural' consequences of a dynamic economy. These changes, in turn, influence employers' hiring and staffing patterns, workers' career paths, and economic growth and development. However, the evolving nature of production processes and technological change have not figured prominently in the development and implementation of policies regarding the preparation of the work force of the future. This paper presents a new perspective: \"skill-training life cycle,\" which evolves as the level of demand and standardization of skills change with the development of a technology, including the steps of introduction, growth, maturity, and decline. This  life-cycle framework in general, and the skill-training life cycle, in particular, suggest a wide range of human resource policy implications for employers, educators and economic planners. Different, although interrelated, roles for employers, schools, and other providers of education and training emerge over the course of the skill-training life cycle. The following three work force development topics are illustrative of these evolving responsibilities: (1) providing new and emerging skills; (2) anticipating skill obsolescence and plant closings; and (3) balancing short-term and long-term work force needs.

This study compared the positive and negative values of having children for undergraduate college students (N=341) in 1977 and and the same subjects' (N=160) values 9 years later in 1986. Nine specific values of having children were assessed using the Value of Children Attitude Scales: (1) children for continuity, tradition, and security; (2) parenthood satisfactions and sense of achievement from children; (3) role motivations of parenthood; (4) happiness and affection from children; (5) goals and incentives from having children; (6) social status from children; (7) external controls pressuring one to become a parent; (8) the costs of children; and (9) decision-mindedness in  childbearing. Results indicated that there were changes with age in the perceived motivations for having children. There was less agreement among the alumni in 1986 than when they were 9 years younger in 1977 on the values of children overall. Disagreements centered on both positive (parental satisfactions and role motivations) and negative (external controls on childbearing, costs of children, and the need for decision-mindedness in childbearing) values associated with childbearing. It seemed that the alumni were less concerned with the constraints of parenthood than they were as undergraduates while they saw parenthood as providing less of a life role and less satisfaction than they had as undergraduates. Gender and parental status also affected how children were valued.  (ABL)",

Men reported using bilateral indirect and unilateral indirect strategies more than did women; women reported using unilateral direct strategies more than men; and there was no gender difference in the use  of bilateral direct strategies. Patterns in romantic and nonromantic other-sex friendships were similar, but women used direct, unilateral strategies more in romantic than in nonromantic friendships.

Battered women who blame their husbands' moods are less likely to leave than are women who blame their husbands' permanent characteristics for the violence. Abused women often have repeated contacts with crisis intervention workers and the attitudes of those workers may affect the attributions made by clients for their husbands' violence. To examine this issue, 52 surveys were completed by volunteers on a crisis intervention hotline for victims of domestic and sexual assault. The surveys asked workers about factors contributing to clients' situations, controllability of those factors, advice they had given, and chances that the situation would be resolved. Perceived resolvability of clients' situations was highly related to perceived  controllability. Controllable factors were mainly circumstantial, rather than internal personality factors, except for substance abuse, which was seen as highly controllable. The regression models which best predicted resolvability involved external circumstances and client variables, rather than partner variables. Actions which were associated with high resolvability of situations were actions which would substantially alter clients' situations. Six references and nine tables are included. (Author/NB)",

Correlates of good health were found to be an optimistic disposition, internal locus of control, education, income, employment outside the home, moderate exercise, and adequate sleep. Variables negatively related to health were stress, external locus of control, packyears of smoking, post-menopausal status, body mass index, and anger symptomatology. Age and social support variables were not related to health status, nor were the anger-in, anger-out, and anger-discuss modes of expressing anger. The regression model accounted for 56% of the variance in health status. The majority of subjects reported  severe daily hassles. High stress and anger somatization were significantly correlated. The findings suggest that a segment of women in mid-life enjoy less than optimal health while experiencing high levels of stress and expressing anger in ways which not only fail to accomplish problem resolution, but which also may alienate significant others. These results have implications for counseling and for future research. References and tables are included. (Author/NB)",

Interviews with 60 therapists revealed that most considered \"lack of therapeutic success\" to be the single most stressful aspect of therapeutic work. Burnout was most often attributed to the nonreciprocated attentiveness, giving, and responsibility demanded by the therapeutic relationship. A survey of clinical psychologists suggests that institutionally-based therapists, as opposed to those in private practice, are more at risk of burnout. Three types of burnout which have been identified among teachers can be used to construct profiles of burned out psychotherapists. The most likely candidate for the first type of  burnout - frenetic overinvolvement - may be the young, highly idealistic therapist. The second type, the worn-out therapist, seems most prevalent among experienced therapists working in institutions with oppressive bureaucratic structures. Finally, there is the underchallenged, underestimated therapist. Trends which may increase the risk of burnout among psychotherapists include the trend toward health maintenance organizations, the trend for an increasing number of individuals with difficult-to-treat character disorders seeking treatment, and the tendency for psychotherapy to become more of a business.

College students (N=68) viewed slides of both wardrobes and rated each wardrobe and the characteristics of the person who would wear the clothes on 7-point scales selected for their relevance to self-monitoring behavior.

Each of the three dimensions is discussed separately, followed by a discussion of their interaction and unification. It is noted that alcohol and other drugs can suppress the symptomatology of CPTSD for many years and that when a person stops using drugs, he/she may experience CPTSD most intensely. CPTSD is defined and symptoms of the disorder are listed. Reasons why CPTSD victims may be attracted to police work are considered. Alcoholism and some behavioral compensation expressions used by alcoholics are discussed. The creation of role immersion or professional protective  emotional suppression in the police officer is explained. Seven dimensions of professional protective emotional suppression are described. The interaction of CPTSD, alcoholism, and role immersion in the police officer is discussed. The report concludes with a set of recommendations for treating the alcoholic police officer. (NB)",

A subset of 423 subjects were selected for this study. Subjects were categorized into three delinquency onset groups: early onset (onset at age 12 years or younger); late onset (onset after age 12 years), and no-onset. The NYS data contained data on delinquency involvement, psychosocial conditions, and demographic characteristics. Analyses were undertaken to determine the impact of age on onset of delinquency on subsequent level, type, and persistence of participation in delinquency. With the exception of damaged property and minor assault, no significant differences between early and late onset groups were  found as to type of crime. Early onset subjects, however, were more likely to engage in serious patterned delinquency and to do so chronically. No significant demographic differences were found, except that males were more likely than females to be in the early onset group. The early and late onset subjects scored poorly on all psychosocial scales and scored significantly poorer than did no-onset subjects. These results suggest age of onset may be an important risk determinant in delinquency research. (Author/NB)",

This study examined the effects on sixth and seventh grade students (N=53) of a stress management program that emphasized self-regulation of physiological aspects of functioning along the relaxation/arousal continuum. The experimental group received intensive training in self-regulation for 7 weeks during the physical education period and then practiced the skills periodically throughout the school year. At the completion of the training period for self-regulation, both the experimental group and the control group engaged in a thinking skills program as part of the regular language arts period. The students in the self-regulation training were impressively successful, as measured by  peripheral temperatures, in changing their levels of arousal or relaxation with the assistance of the trainer. On their own, students continued to be successful in relaxing, but failed to master the skill of eliciting the arousal response at will. Throughout the thinking skills program, the experimental group tended to score higher on teacher-made tests than did the control group, but they failed to outperform their counterparts on a standardized test of higher-order cognitive abilities. The treatment tended to diminish significantly perceived anxiety levels and to improve perceptions of students about themselves. (Author/ABL)",

        "description":"Traditionally, assessment of the cognitive competencies of older adults has focused on abstract laboratory tests, which have often seemed quite unlike the demands of tasks encountered in everyday activities. Consequently, external validity of these laboratory tasks has been questioned, and their utility for assessing real-world competence has been debated. This study examined age-related change in performance on a measure of everyday competence, the ETS Basic Skills Test, a 65-item multiple-choice measure. Subjects were older adults (N=102) who participated in a 7-year follow-up of the Adult Development and Enrichment Program. When change was examined at the intraindividual level, 62 percent of the subjects had scores classified as stable or increased, despite findings of  significant mean decline over the 7-year period. Measures of crystallized and fluid intelligences were identified as significant predictors of basic skills performance via multiple regression analyses. The finding of significant intellectual and personal predictors of basic skills performance has two implications for further study of competence in everday activities. First, the findings indicated substantial relationships between traditional, academic forms of intelligence and at least some forms of practical intelligence. Secondly, the findings of the regression analyses suggest that it may be possible to isolate some of the variables predisposing an individual to be \"at risk\" for incompetence in certain types of everyday tasks.

        "description":"Values in the workplace have long been a topic of interest for both researchers in organizational behavior and management practitioners alike. Values are believed to be deeply internalized standards for personal behavior because they are based on a person's experience. Relatively little attention has been paid to the processes relating to individual differences in value stability. Such individual differences should have implications for the relationship between values and decision-making. This study examined the issue of work value stability and the extent to which individual differences in value stability affect the relationship between values and decision-making. Subjects, undergraduate college students (N=79), participated in three survey sessions. At each session they  completed a work values measure and a decision-making task. At the second session, an effort was made to alter the importance of one value, concern for others. Results indicated that while as a whole, values were relatively stable over the short time interval studied, some individuals were more stable than others. These people were more likely to emphasize their values in decision-making. This study raises important issues with regard to predicting behavior from values. Not only are outside influences a factor in reducing the explanatory power of values, but by failing to discriminate between individuals who have developed self-schemas concerning particular values from those who have not, ability to understand the values-behavior relationship is limited.

        "description":"Little theoretical and empirical knowledge is available in the social work field to guide practitioners in the area of single parent adoption. In the context of demographics, the single parent family is now conventional. However there is not yet conclusive research on the success or failure of single parent households. Research has suggested that many special needs children are being placed with families that are or will be stressed by potentially destructive economic conditions. Arguments for single parenting include that single parenting may be the placement of choice for children due to past history; no research has shown that single parenting is in itself pathological; and an appropriate single parent is better than no home at all. Arguments against single parenting include  the views that two parent families can provide role models for both sexes or that the two parent family is the \"normal\" family structure; and birth mothers prefer two parent families. Current research into the infant-father relationship could greatly enlighten the discussion of single parenting. While still inconclusive, the available research suggests that single persons are a resource for children but that sufficient questions still exist to prevent an unqualified endorsement of single parent adoption. The need for enlightenment is pressing, for children, would-be parents, and adoption professionals, who are not served when knowledge is replaced by myth and misconception. (ABL)",

Before entering into any discussion of a controversial issue, it is important to examine the rhetoric. The debate has been defined, for the most part, by proponents of the new, experimental practice known as \"open adoption\" or \"openness\" in adoption. Traditional adoption, labeled \"closed\" adoption, suggests secrecy and narrow-mindedness. Terms such as \"traditional\" and \"experimental\" adoption would be more appropriate. Pregnancy counseling should include: (1) a realistic  assessment of the birthparent's needs and resources; (2) decision-making on all options open to a woman; (3) carrying out the decision; (4) mourning of the loss of role, status, and relationship as a parent; and (5) acceptance and integration of the pregnancy and adoption experience into the individual's life. If there are problems with outcome in adoption, it should be known what has caused them. If the cause of adoption problems is more closely related to unresolved reasons for pregnancy, family problems, etc., the client is not served by focusing on only the adoption. (Author/ABL)",

Only about 7% of teenagers having babies make alternate childrearing plans either through formal adoption or informally with members of their families. The emphasis on making teenagers good parents may short-circuit the decision-making process and may inadvertently push teenagers, who may not be willing or able, into parenting. Schools can provide positive information about adoption. Agencies should look at their policies and the services which are offered to pregnant teenagers to determine whether they may be subtly encouraging single parenting over adoption. Adoption practices have changed in attempts to correct what may  have been mistakes in the past. There is a trend in good adoption agencies to provide more post-adoption services to all members of the adoption circle. Networking between adoption agencies and non-adoption providers of service, particularly schools, health clinics, and family planning providers, can benefit young women. In order to provide the best services possible to meet the needs of pregnant teenagers, their male partners, their babies, and their families, every agency in the community needs to work together.

Traits related to demonstrating competence were rated by college students (N=45) in psychology courses as being more prevalent and requiring more instances of behavior to confirm their presence than traits related to demonstrating superiority. Significantly more evidence was perceived to be required to confirm than disconfirm the presence  of traits related to demonstrating competence but not for traits related to demonstrating superiority.

Given the widespread interest in teaching thinking and the increasing number of programs to satisfy that interest, it could be assumed that the incidence of direct instruction in thinking at the classroom level would be rapidly increasing. However, the implementation of thinking skills programs appears to be a slow process, with many hurdles to overcome. Barriers to the implementation of thinking skills instruction--including a narrow view of curriculum, a narrow view of  assessment, and involvement of non-educator groups in pedagogical decisions--should be addressed at the policy level. A curriculum which included the teaching of thinking would necessarily have a balance among factual content objectives, metacognitive objectives, and cognitive objectives. Those in positions of authority at the local, state, and national levels should mandate that assessment techniques should not be comprised primarily of objective, quantitative measures. Instead, more holistic and qualitative measures must be legitimized within education. Finally, distinctions as to the domain of responsibility of educators versus non-educators must be established and articulated at all policy levels. (Twenty-two references are attached.) (MM)",

Subjects, 88 inmates of normal intelligence, normal hearing, and no significant speech abnormalities, at a minimum-security prison, were given reading comprehension tests and tests of listening perception. Subjects were divided into poor readers (less than sixth grade reading level) and adequate readers (greater than sixth grade level). Results indicated that poor readers were surprisingly uniform; they differed from good ones on several cognitive and linguistic measures. Results also indicated that among poor readers, the best predictors of comprehension are decoding and short-term memory and that poor  readers have a hidden deficit in that they are more affected by noise when trying to perceive familiar spoken words. Findings suggest that adult poor readers strongly resemble poor readers in elementary school in the areas of short-term memory and decoding skills.

Studies of adult poor readers indicate that segmentation is important for them as well as for children. Segmental conception of speech must be taught at an early age with particular  attention to those with learning difficulties, but there is no contradiction in recognizing that segmental analysis and phonics skills are critical while also recognizing that learning to read and spell proceeds in several channels at once.

Findings indicated that the bulk of the apparent declines in 9- and 17-year-olds' reading scores was probably artifactual; that while NAEP is a better barometer of national achievement trends than any  available alternative, the quality of its trend reporting could be improved considerably (three recommendations are given); and that state-level assessments should be managed by a separate program unit within the National-NAEP organization, and should be parallel to the National-NAEP in most respects. The report concludes with 13 papers (individually authored or coauthored by panel members) addressing particular issues within the charge of the panel. (SR)",

Over a 3-day period 60 English/language arts students wrote informational reports composed of content they selected from 3 source texts (encyclopedia articles on a single topic) as well as content they added. Text analyses revealed patterns associated with both grade level and reading ability in selecting and connecting content, since the older students and the accomplished readers included larger proportions of intertextually important content from the source texts and provided more connectivity for their readers.  Analyses also revealed patterns associated with reading ability in the nature of the text structures that students used to organize clusters of content. Moreover, differences between readers were manifested on measures of task management as well as on text features, with the accomplished readers developing more elaborate written plans and spending more time on the task. The study extended research into writing as well as research into reading by focusing on a hybrid, reading-to-write task that involves both constructive processes.

Experimental and control groups each worked for three 40-minute periods on the training text (an expository passage of 1800 words) and its three maps.

Results also suggest that beliefs about reading and writing ability become increasingly important factors in predicting reading and writing skill as children age and master skills.

The selection of spelling words from word lists versus pupil-teacher planning in spelling word selection is a related issue in spelling instruction.

To supplement this traditional approach, students should also direct their discourse to audiences who are not projected as superior critics. One paper assignment that can move students in an advanced course towards a concept of peer readership is the &quot;proposal directed at a specified small group.&quot; Students advocate a specific action to a small, carefully defined, local group that has the power to make that proposal happen. Students must name the members of the small group, and include a short rationale analyzing the probable beliefs and values of those members, based on occupational and geographical  circumstances, personal interviews, local rumor, or any other kind of evidence they deem applicable. This assignment succeeds in addressing nonthreatening readerships because it is addressed to a small group rather than to an individual, and it demands that the student choose a specific value system to characterize the attitudes and beliefs of the selected group. Although many students have trouble separating the value system of their chosen audience from the values most closely associated with the thesis and content of the paper itself, the value systems approach succeeds in moving students towards a clearer sense of reader uniqueness. The assignment also helps students initiate conversation between their composing selves and their various other selves. It teaches then the important  human value of &quot;seeing otherwise.&quot; (MM)",

The 5-year-old child (Jamie) heard the story in its complete form on the first session and then retold it each week for 8 weeks. The adult listener answered her questions but did not help unless asked. The sessions were audiotaped and transcripts were analyzed for changes in the quality and nature of the child's retellings. Results revealed that the child nearly doubled the amount of information she told over time and that the quality of her retelling improved dramatically. Change involved elaboration of important text elements, including initiating event, problem, and resolution; rendering of characters' remarks, explaining and interpreting  story events and characters' reactions; and reading some of the actual words in the story. For the first two sessions the retellings were brief. Then the child made a shift to a storytelling approach, and during the last two sessions she shifted again, attempting to read large portions of the text. The results suggest that a child who is accustomed to storybook reading at home can use a repeated retelling activity to tell a story and eventually can render it so close to the actual text that an advance into reading may occur.

Using a case study of textbook perception and use in a school district's sixth grade social studies classrooms, the paper illustrates the relationships between rhetorical form, textbook use, and selection. Rhetorical form is discussed on four levels: the knowledge level; the metadiscourse level; the text level; and the disciplinary level. A criterion checklist is provided to help teachers systematize their subjective judgments about the quality of textbooks, and a range of variables to which educators, authors, and publishers need to be sensitive. Finally, the paper  suggests practical activities and concrete procedures which teachers can use to influence the selection process. Five tables of data are included, and 38 references are attached.

        "description":"&quot;Purpose&quot; is an important term in rhetorical theory and writing pedagogy. An analysis of the presentation of &quot;purpose&quot; in three well-regarded, theory-based textbooks (&quot;Writing in the Liberal Arts Tradition: A Rhetoric with Readings,&quot;&quot;Writing with a Purpose,&quot; and &quot;Form and Surprise in Composition&quot;) suggests that &quot;purpose&quot; is a more complex and relative concept than is typically acknowledged. All three textbooks present radically different versions of &quot;purpose,&quot; corresponding to three different rhetorical traditions: Classical-Poetic, Romantic, and Classical-Rhetorical. It makes more sense to think of &quot;purpose&quot; in writing as a relative term with meanings that vary in particular kinds of rhetorical situations. For example, in highly determined social contexts, &quot;purpose&quot; is the  action that writers want their readers to take with respect to an exigence. On the other extreme are &quot;free&quot; rhetorical situations in which the audience is not specified, the exigence not given, the genre unknown--the type of writing sometimes assigned in freshman writing. Because the meaning of &quot;purpose&quot; is unstable, teachers should not generalize about how writers arrive at &quot;purpose.&quot; In addition, &quot;purpose&quot; should always be seen as relative to the particular social situation that the writing course imagines itself serving.

The answers transcended any obvious ones tied to the generic differences between the courses or the relative ages of the students in them. The answers lie at the nexus of politics, pedagogy, and language, and emerged from a heightened sense of language education as a political act. The typical freshman composition course unconsciously and counterproductively serves tradition-bound notions of cultural literacy. The crucial  characteristic distinguishing the seminar participants from South Africa from the American minority students was their acute awareness of the sociological conditions and terms of their participation in the educational enterprise. In deciding to be teachers of English they had to accept the great political--hence pedagogical--compromise of the South African language policy. In the context of an oppressive culture they knew what it meant to have a right to your own language but to learn another nevertheless. They were in this crucial way better prepared to teach their minority students than teachers in American institutions. (RAE)",

State and institutional approaches to assessment in higher education are discussed, and common components of assessment programs are listed. Various caveats on estimating the costs and benefits of assessment are presented. In order to understand the need for various types of assessment, an analytical framework encompassing different claims (costs and benefits of assessment) is required. Benefits and costs are arrayed against a range of parties at interest, including individual students,  faculty, institutions, external constituents, and the public. Information is provided on benefits of assessment by identified parties at interest, dollar costs of assessment, and some externalities of assessment. Policy alternatives include: statewide testing of basic skills; and requiring institutions to undertake local assessment. Such a framework can help identify the major categories of cost and benefit associated with any assessment approach and with estimating trade-offs among different posed alternatives.

It is important to consider long term outlooks in order to better understand how they might affect current planning. Three basic assumptions when dealing with this issue are: it is not possible to predict the future over long periods; it is possible to observe and understand forces of change that suggest that certain events have a greater probability than others; and it is possible to influence these trends today to shape the future. Several changes over the past 25 years are noted. The importance of  finding several major forces that could shape the future are discussed (e.g., unanticipated acts of God, political and social trends, technological changes, power shifts, and environmental concerns). These major forces of change can develop into the critical issues of the future. Two critical issues to consider in Arizona are: (1) the infrastructure of the state might become more mature as the growth rate slows and the demands for services increase; and (2) the political and social climate will shift to include a range of subjects and an increase in the types and diversity of individuals involved in the issues. Implications of these possible future changes include a great amount of uncertainty over the next decade and a wide variety of viewpoints. A few critical events could have profound  effects. (SM)",

        "description":"One of the working papers in the final report of the Arizona Board of Regents' Task Force on Excellence, Efficiency and Competitiveness, this document discusses the importance of foresight (a broad based, future-oriented evaluation) for Arizona's universities. Institutions of all types must recognize varying degrees of a need to base their decisions on adequate consideration of key external and internal trends as well as potential changes in these trends. Institutions must evaluate their own strengths and weaknesses in terms of present and anticipated operating environments. Foresight provides background for strategic planning activities by early recognition of changes. It also develops a framework within which to make today's decisions. It helps avoid future negative  consequences and costs of ignoring external and internal factors during times of uncertainty. Foresight techniques include literature reviews, small group discussions, and roundtables or advisory committees. Implementation issues and possible pitfalls of this process are noted along with key ingredients for a successful program (e.g., understand today's realities first, involve the end user, and evaluate both data and ideas). The next decade in Arizona will bring much uncertainty in many areas involving the state and the university. Foresight capability should be developed in the universities and the Regents' staff in support of both strategic planning and current decision processes. Two appendices provide recent examples of foresight efforts by the U.S. Office of Technology Assessment  and historic examples of results of not using foresight capability. Contains 13 references.

Areas of institutional focus are identified to help develop institutional mission statements. University requests for program changes for fiscal years 1981 to 1989 were obtained from ABOR's office and university files. The following data were obtained for each program request: university priority ranking, full time equivalent personnel, funding, and title. Additional data were added for total number of submissions by universities to ABOR, and total ABOR approved submissions by the universities to the  legislature. Each program request was assigned 1 of 17 keywords (e.g., education, business, medical, public service, and general undergraduate). During this 9-year period, there were 716 requests by the universities to ABOR for $282.5 million, and 222 were approved for $83 million. Results are summarized in 11 tables (e.g., program changes by subject, program changes by year, and program changes by university). Ten conclusions include: the actual range of approved to submitted requests varies by year and by university; the program change mechanism is an effective way to build existing or new programs within the universities; and university guidance to administrative units for program change submissions varies widely. Four recommendations include: universities should be more efficient in  processing program change requests, and the board should consider revising slightly the program change portion of the budget process.

A discussion includes: state enrollment possibilities; historical trends and driving forces of change; previous studies; special concerns for Arizona; assumptions for enrollment analysis; uncertainties for enrollment forecasting; enrollment scenarios for 1988-2000; selected  forecasts; implications for Arizona universities; role of minority, out of state, and foreign students; and alternative growth options. Arizona's universities will fare better than many universities during the next 5- to 7-year period of national decline in high school graduates. The real costs of increased enrollment are not adequately provided by additional state funding. Three recommendations include: ABOR should alter the form of its report on student enrollment to better identify various types of enrollments, and new educational delivery systems should be investigated to slow the demand for on-campus enrollment growth. Four appendices provide: enrollment management; national and state historical trend data; future needs of the state report; and revisited enrollment forecasts. Many  tables and figures are included.

The objectives of the undergraduate writing course include improvement of the quality of undergraduate writing skills at ISU, working together with area high schools and community colleges in improving the learning and teaching of writing skills throughout Illinois, and the  dissemination of model curricular strategies and materials, research findings, and methods of assessing writing skills. Evidence of program effectiveness includes the following: incorporating writing into the study of other disciplines makes students active participants in the learning process; the use of microcomputers improves the productivity, attendance, and punctuality of students; and the effects of implementing the Writing Placement Exam reach far beyond simply identifying those students who need improvement in writing and supplying them with intensive tutoring to an alteration of instructors' evaluation perspectives.

The process of curricular change that led to the development of new courses entitled &quot;Origins&quot; (investigating the origins of the universe, earth, human life, the mind, and society) and &quot;Race, Gender, and Human Identity&quot; (reflecting the unique history and mission of the college as a historically black college) is explained. These interdisciplinary, team-taught courses are required of all students in baccalaureate degree programs. The new general education core curriculum at the college is an attempt to define a common learning experience for all students. The components of the core curriculum are structured into three groups (interdisciplinary matrix,  intellectual and personal development, and modes of inquiry). This project has determined the following: curricular change in general education should begin with a thorough review of the strengths and weaknesses of the current curriculum; change must be based on the institution's mission, resources, student background and needs, and the sense of the need for change; the core curriculum should include distinctive components that reflect the educational values of the institution; and faculty support is essential for innovative approaches to teaching. Appended are an outline of the core curriculum and syllabi for the two courses. (SM)",

This program enables instructors to tape test review sessions which are broadcast live and then later rebroadcast at other times on Appalachian's closed circuit cable system. It is not designed to be a primary instructional vehicle but rather a supplement through which the instructor provides extra materials for students that the students may or may not choose to use. For many students needing tutorial assistance, repetition is a key to better learning, and this program allows that. Videotutoring operates under the philosophy that the best tutor for any course is the  course instructor. Results indicate from 75-80% of a class will watch a videotutoring session at least once. The major conclusions about videotutoring as a pedagogical tool support the assertion that a small extra effort on the instructor's part results in strong affective gains in how the students feel about the instructor and about the class that the instructor teaches. Student performance in the course tends to improve, sometimes by as much as one letter grade. (SM)",

A key component to the institute is the follow-up visit which involves Institute faculty making site visits to participants during the school year to provide support and foster ongoing communication between the school and programs and Gallaudet College. The program was planned on the assumption that although teachers of hearing impaired students have adequate training in deaf education, they have insufficient background  in mathematics, have not kept up with the latest developments in mathematics education, and are not sufficiently computer literate. Participants had to take courses in math and computer literacy as well as a course in cognition and problem solving. Various guest presentations and seminars were also required. Evaluation forms filled out by the participants at the end of the summer rated the program very highly overall. Followup visits proved to be an integral and fruitful part of the program. (SM)",

Typical psychological orientations that college personnel use in understanding student behaviors are discussed. Six psychological orientations applied to first-year students are psychoanalytic, biological, cognitivist, cognitive developmental, humanistic-existentialist, and behaviorist views. The elements of College Success based on learning theory for  first-year students are noted (academic skill development, notes, vocabulary, learning and memory, test taking, brainstorming, recordkeeping, problem solving and decision making, academic social behaviors, advisement, orientation, and conduct of the course). The development of College Success with attention to innovation theory is discussed. Results show the course is successful according to grade point average, academic dismissal, and student and instructor feedback.

Some of the highlights of the program in its first 2 years are: expansion of the Honors Program; development of a comprehensive marketing plan; upgrading of the financial aid process; expansion of academic assistance via Learning Assistance Centers and help sessions; faculty development programming; and establishment of an Admissions Clearinghouse to respond to inquiries within a 24-hour period. This program produced immediate results, with the fall 1986 semester enrollment exceeding the 12,000 student total for the first  time since 1982. Total headcount enrollments increased by 1.9% from 1985, with on-campus enrollments up 3.8%. New freshmen for fall 1986 increased 2.8%, and graduate enrollments showed significant gain. Extension undergraduate enrollments increased at all levels. The university also experienced a rise in the academic quality of freshmen enrollees. Overall enrollments have continued to grow due to improved recruitment efforts and retention rates. Between 1984 and 1987, the freshmen to sophomore retention rates increased from 66% to 71% with impressive improved retention rates for minority students. (SM)",

ESL students represent 40% of the college's student body, and instructing them is a significant intellectual and pedagogical challenge. Despite training in English language and composition, ESL students and their teachers have problems due to incomplete acculturation. The result is that when they begin their required humanities courses, many experience considerable difficulty. Some drop out of college and others feel themselves limited to the sciences for their choice of major. To remedy this problem, Queens College designed syllabi for a course for students unfamiliar with the assumptions of American culture. A  biweekly faculty seminar met to develop the syllabi. The seminar discussed important theoretical issues, designed trial syllabi, and designed evaluation procedures to gather information on student response. After completing the third semester of teaching courses designed by this seminar, the importance of teaching every component of a course with a density of culturally and historically significant material was noted. Issues must be significantly historicized for students to actively grasp the assumptions behind them and to have enough information to demonstrate that mastery. Student comments on these courses are favorable, and student enrollments have jumped. (SM)",

The project's ultimate goal is to enhance and broaden courses and facilitate interdisciplinary understanding and critical thinking by overcoming fragmentation, compartmentalization, and isolation.  Faculty resource teams relate complex global issues. Topics presented in the initial year are the socialist world, national policies and their international impact, developing nations, culture learning, and culture and perception. Participant response to this program has been very enthusiastic. Students suggested that this approach would be very helpful in almost all university classes, and the given time frame should be expanded since so much material could be covered.

The curriculum is designed to educate and train qualified Master's level students, the majority of whom are minority, disabled, or working women, to become professional rehabilitation counselors for multidisabled alcohol abusers. Individuals with this unique skill will fill the gap between rehabilitation agencies serving the disabled and those serving alcoholics. A number of studies have found that alcohol dependency is as prevalent among the disabled as among the general population. Many disabled persons are excluded from the services of professional chemical dependency agencies by such obstacles as a lack of wheelchair access and interpretive services for the deaf. Also, they may encounter  negative attitudes on the part of alcoholism counselors who may be ignorant of the psychosocial aspects of various disabilities. Expected outcomes of this project include the following: graduating students will bring to any position in the rehabilitation field a sensitivity to this subject; graduates will be eligible to take the New York State credentialing examination for alcoholism counselors and the Certified Rehabilitation Counselor examination for which all graduating students are eligible; a core of audiovisual materials will have been developed; and the curriculum can act as a model for other rehabilitation training programs.

        "description":"This report discusses a comprehensive plan designed in 1984 to internationalize the Illinois State University curriculum. This plan focused on four major areas: study abroad, foreign student and scholar services, curriculum development, and faculty development. Fundamental to the internationalizing process was the recognition that no serious curriculum revision would take place without faculty support and involvement. Within 5 years of beginning this plan, much of it is in effect. For example: over 2000 students enrolled in study abroad programs; about 300 faculty members participated in international professional activities; 31 new international courses were added to the curriculum; and almost $1 million in external funding was generated to support additional international  programming. This internationalizing plan became one of the university's five major planning priorities for 1985-90. The results prove that significant progress can still be made without major infusions of new funding. Other institutions wishing to begin such a process should spend time on the following issues: secure support of key administrators; identify key faculty with international interest; centralize planning and supervision of the effort; assess curricular and staff strengths; and focus on faculty development. The planning proposal is appended. (SM)",

Specific goals associated with this program include: to offer a curriculum familiarizing MARC students with the basic assumptions, principles, and research methodology of their major disciplines; to provide the necessary skills to evaluate critically a body of literature in a particular research area; and to enable them to design, conduct, and statistically evaluate  experiments that test specific hypotheses in a particular research area. A full 2-year commitment to the program is required, and during these 2 years, students receive mentoring from a researcher in anthropology, psychology, and/or sociology. Ten schools in the United States offer MARC programs, five of them historically black colleges.

PACAT serves academic departments by providing the results of the national curriculum surveys which permit them to compare their requirements to those of other institutions. It also furnishes exit examinations intended to provide enhanced feedback about student performance and curriculum. To date more than 1,300 tests have been administered at public and private postsecondary institutions  in several states. PACAT is responding to a need within the academic community for new assessment models intended for outcomes assessment where both students and curricula are being evaluated. Preliminary data collected by the project indicate strong support from the academic community for the curriculum surveys and a three-fold increase in 2 years in the number of ACATs administered.

It works with about 50 potential dropouts (two-thirds female) at Covington Holmes and Newport High Schools, addressing these issues. They will be offered the following: motivational and personal counseling to set career goals; economic opportunities for jobs in which their pay is based particularly on academic achievement; academic tutoring from peers; child care if  needed; positive role models from volunteer mentors; referral to social agencies if necessary; and encouragement to make postsecondary plans through help from various agencies.

The results have been overwhelmingly positive in promoting increased understanding of the workings of the college, institutional change, and collegial perspectives.  Participants provide regular evaluation of the program. Important values of such a faculty leadership development program include the following: tired faculty are revitalized; young or new faculty are quickly brought into campus activity; a sense of partnership with the administration and community is developed; and a valuable network of colleagues is developed. To be successful, such a program must be flexible, current, relevant to faculty needs, and faculty-guided. Its primary thrust must be professional, with human relations aspects included. (SM)",

Through a combination of academic classes, field observations, guest lectures, and internships, the students receive both an academic and practical introduction to the justice system, encouraging them to consider justice system careers. Since the program's beginning in 1983, more than 85 students have participated, and many of them are now considering their undergraduate educations in the justice field.  Others have assumed professional positions in justice-related agencies. Alaska Native students have represented all of the traditional groups indigenous to Alaska, and other minority groups represented are Hispanic and Black Americans and displaced homemakers.

The purposes of this project are to develop a practical model of support and assistance to new teachers, particularly those working with students from culturally diverse backgrounds, and to promote the retention of these teachers in such settings. It involves university faculty from the arts and sciences along with staff development personnel, resource teachers, mentors, and administrators from the school district. The three major assistance components of the project are professional development, psychological and collegial support, and scholarships and materials stipends. Some of the actions and conditions  that have contributed significantly to this project's survival and success are as follows: sufficient resources; minimal creation of separate policy and project review structures; a realization of the importance of open honest communication among partners; self-regulated restraint on the part of all involved parties; and clerical support. Conclusions include the following: new teachers quickly realize that teaching is psychologically, intellectually, and physically arduous; many new teachers show a preoccupation with the immediate and practical; and assistance must be multifaceted, with personal support and encouragement for self and peer reliance.

In addition, eight faculty members were given the opportunity to develop gerontology courses specific to their own disciplines, to be taught through their home departments. Finally, a series of six faculty development colloquium seminars were conducted to stimulate interest in aging among faculty and students. The interdisciplinary minor in gerontology was formally  implemented as an official university program. The program was also evaluated by an external consultants, and courses were evaluated. The program is considered successful and cost-effective. (KM)",

In 1984, the college began a 2.5-year project to revitalize and strengthen its required sophomore level three course humanities sequence (Greece and Rome, the Middle Ages to the Eighteenth Century, the Modern World), tracing cultural monuments of western civilization from antiquity to the modern era. The sequence enrolls 600 students per year, most of whom are vocationally-oriented with non-intellectual backgrounds. The courses are team-taught by three faculty members from literature, music, and art. They focus on helping students discover the connections among the disciplines. They have an  experiential component incorporating hands-on experience that requires students to chisel marble, experiment with tempera, and attempt different keyboard instruments to gain a better understanding of the process behind the work. Students must attend numerous live events and write reviews of them. To create the program, three key faculty members attended a special summer-long faculty development program at Yale University. Their experiences formed the model they brought back for the teaching teams in the program. This program is highly successful, gaining both local and national recognition. The bulk of the document consists of appended essays containing the evaluations and recommendations of five nationally recognized interdisciplinary scholars brought to the campus as consultants. Sample  syllabi from the three courses, and the responses from students collected at the end of the 1987-88 sequence complete the document. (Author/SM)",

Therefore the enhancement of both cognitive and affective development should be considered essential to the missions of postsecondary institutions so that self-determination and self-direction can best result. The needs existing on Eastern's campus underlying the establishment of an inter-divisional student development structure were: to improve the academic skills of students; to bring academic  units and student services departments closer together; to improve academic advising; to provide assistance to specific groups of students; and to deal with budget reductions. The purposes and goals of SAS are: to provide personal planning and self-development services to students; to integrate advising, counseling, and academic support services; to provide academic advising to undeclared students; to provide career planning materials; and to provide learning aids, tutoring, and consultation. The SAS Center offers a blend of classrooms, tutoring, practical skills laboratories, computers, people, programs, and services. Contains 6 references. (SM)",

It occurs every 10 years and consists of a 4-day, in-house conference having scheduled sessions, moderators, recorders, hosted receptions, and meals. Classes are cancelled as faculty, administrators, and selected students and non-academic personnel assess the state of the college and plan for its future. From the second Assessment Week in 1986 came an annual Development Day to review, evaluate, and revise the outcomes of 1986 Assessment Week suggestions, recommendations, goals, and programs. Topics of discussion at the  1986 Assessment Week included: relative quality of programs; liberal arts versus career education; quality of life on campus; interdisciplinary courses; faculty esprit; and handicapped students. Development Day is based on Assessment Week with the scope defined by the 1-day duration. In 1987 and 1988, themes were chosen by task forces and included critical thinking, non-profit ventures, and recruiting, and the college community met to determine the college's weaknesses and strengths and decide on the needs and concerns of the coming year. Assessment Week 1986 made 88 suggestions and recommendations, of which 65 were in place 10 years later. Development Day 1988 created nine reports, all of which are being examined by the community and acted upon by faculty and staff. An appendix provides  the agenda for Assessment Week 1986.

It is intended to help A.A.S. degree transfer students become better equipped to meet the expectations of the educational experience of this neglected minority, and to facilitate the transition between community and four-year institutions. Persistence, performance, and baccalaureate completion rates of A.A.S. transfers should be increased. At CUNY, A.A.S. students represent the largest transfer cohort yet they are the least well  prepared in seeking transfer into four-year schools. Transfer Express activities include reinforcement of basic writing skills, introduction to advanced skills in research, exposure to history, connections with the community and the senior college faculty, and specialized transfer advisement. The project is offered during three consecutive semesters to about 675 CUNY students in two disciplines. It will be replicated nationally for two consecutive semesters at two or three sites. Intended outcomes are to: enhance writing, research, and critical thinking skills; increase student retention at the baccalaureate level; and improve student performance. (SM)",

        "description":"A faculty development program designed to encourage critical thinking skills across the curriculum at the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire is described in this report. The program's goal was to stimulate faculty to add critical thinking to their pedagogical objectives. Faculty participants attended six 4-hour meetings designed to heighten their awareness and appreciation of critical thinking. They were randomly assigned to a 50-member program group or to a 22-member control group. The six meetings discussed the following: a definition and discussion of critical thinking; the adaptability of different teaching styles to critical thinking; the extent to which participants engaged in critical thinking and pedagogical activities consistent with critical thinking objectives;  evaluation of critical thinking behavior; small group discussion of 38 plans made by participants; and sharing lessons learned while implementing the plans. Results indicate the program did not increase scores of faculty participants on the Ennis-Weir Critical Thinking Essay Test. Also, students sampled from classes taught by control and experimental faculty did not differ on posttest measures. Problems faced by such faculty development projects include: different needs among faculty from different disciplines; reluctance of faculty to admit skill deficiencies; and difficulty matching faculty development program and evaluation instruments. Faculty noted that students often resist critical thinking, and critical thinking pedagogy is very time consuming. Contains 14 references.  (Author/SM)",

        "description":"Arts Unlimited, housed at Bowling Green State University, Ohio, is a program of aesthetic education in the schools of northwestern and north central Ohio and is modeled after and works with Lincoln Center Institute, the educational division of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City. The goal of Lincoln Center Institute and its colleagues is to help students and teachers perceive and evaluate the aesthetic elements of specific works of music, theater, dance, and visual arts. By doing so, children will come to value the arts not only as an enrichment for their lives, but also as a set of intellectual skills by which they may inquire into the aesthetic dimensions of their environments. This year-round, three-stage program includes a summer teacher's workshop, a  follow-up program in the schools (sending teaching artists into the schools to assist teachers), and a series of spring performances or exhibitions of the works encountered by the teachers the previous summer for the children. Since 1981, this program has worked with over 600 teachers and 25,000 students in 50 schools within a 13-county area. It is recommended that if such a program is initiated on a college campus, attention must be paid to the following points: the cost effectiveness of the program must be demonstrated; faculty can earn extra money as teaching artists and can renew themselves professionally via this program; and the program must emphasize service to the schools.

It is the St. Louis site of the National Writing Project founded at the University of California, Berkeley to meet the critical need for highly skilled teachers of writing. GWP has helped students at all levels learn to write by providng specialized training for their teachers. From 1984 to 1987, it developed a model integrating computers into a program of staff development, action research, and support for instructional change in writing. Staff development has consisted of summer institutes for teachers, 1-day seminars for administrators, and a variety of credit courses and noncredit workshops. Action research has included case studies, text analyses, and participant  observation in the classrooms of trained teachers. Support has focused on four pilot schools where teachers and administrators formed writing improvement teams. The project's impact has been far-reaching and rapid, including five curriculum guides to teaching writing with computers, dozens of articles, and program replication at an inner-city teacher's college. Information has been shared with educators statewide and internationally. Because of this project, the university can now offer valid, classroom based information to schools and teachers planning computer equipped writing programs.

These summer institutes were all followed up with in-service days during the following academic year. The third year of the program targeted mentor teachers or teachers who would conduct an in-service program for their district. The theme of hazardous materials proved to be an excellent way of integrating basic science principles, recent advances in science, science and engineering technologies, and the relationship and role of science in society. Twenty-five curriculum modules/laboratory exercises were developed, field tested,  and critiqued by peers. Field trips were taken to 11 sites to illustrate specific concepts or problems covered in the program. The gap between the private industrial sector and the educational sector was bridged with these numerous site visits and opportunities for interaction with experts from industry. A summary evaluation shows that all of the participants have introduced topics covered in the institute into their teaching, and 81% of their students are considering careers related to subjects covered in the institute. An institute brochure is appended. (Author/SM)",

        "description":"The Bilingual Education Programs at Central Washington University (CWU) are described in this report. CWU has developed programs for training teachers to deal with Limited English Proficient (LEP) students in both undergraduate and advanced study. Training includes language and linguistics, culture and bicultural education methodology, and development of intercultural communication skills. Minority language students are encouraged to participate to help provide more minority language bilingual teachers for role models. In 1979, CWU instituted a Bilingual Studies major which has been expanded to become the Bilingual Intercultural Education major and minor. The graduate programs have added four areas with bilingual specialization. There are now tenure track positions for bilingual  education personnel. Non-minority students are being trained in dealing with linguistic and cultural equity issues in public schools. This program has successfully met its recruitment quotas by insuring that over 50% of its clientele is from minority groups. Some recommendations for a small university wishing to implement such a program with minimal resources include: use existing university and outside resources; get an institutional commitment; and develop close communications with districts with bilingual programs and LEP populations. Three appendixes making up the bulk of the document provide: (1) a description of the various program options available at CWU plus a brief course description; (2) a sample evaluation of the bilingual education graduate studies program; and (3) a site  visit report by a federal official.

Among project goals are: to improve teacher skills and qualifications in science teaching and offer access to instructional resources; to eliminate teacher isolation; and to develop inter-district collaboration. This collaboration among university and secondary school science teachers has resulted in a model for the professional development of science teachers and improvement of science curricula. The model includes a regional computerized resource-sharing network that actively involves teachers in exchanging and integrating successful approaches, materials and curricula into their teaching practices.  Inter-district cooperation and participation in curriculum and resource development occurs because the geographical boundaries normally constraining such a process are eliminated. The network reduces isolation of teachers from their peers and provides opportunities to seek help from experienced colleagues and university faculty. It brings the outside world to the classroom and takes students into the world to discuss topics of interest with students in other locations, visit with scientists, and participate in inter-school activities. The use of computer conferencing has increased throughout the duration of the project. (Author/SM)",

The program encourages the active collaboration of many institutional partners (the United States Navy, San Diego State University, and San Diego Unified Public Schools) as well as of three academic divisions at San Diego State University. The project alters the current teacher preparation program by focusing much of the credential coursework on pedagogical  content knowledge. Major project activities include: creation of an internship plan; development of a school-based site; and establishment of a staff and organizational structure. One of the characteristics of this program is the constant requirement for intensive contact with the candidates who seem to require a lot of support due to the trauma of leaving the predictable world of the military for the unpredictable world of higher education.

They gave about 66 hours during the school year to each of the three teachers. Teachers, mentors, and school administrators were unanimously enthusiastic about the program. The project indicates that retired teachers, with adequate training and selection can provide helpful mentoring to new teachers, reducing attrition and improving their  teaching performance through increased understanding of students, enhanced technical skills, and induction of new teachers into the social system of the school. Conclusions drawn from the program are: (1) mentors should be selected on the basis of their experience and their perceived aptitude for service as consultants; (2) a training period is essential to help retirees make the transition from teaching children to consulting with adults; (3) field services to mentors are essential to assist them in their own work; and (4) it is helpful if mentors do not have concurrent teaching duties with which mentoring may conflict.

This personal training program prepares master's level candidates to become certified educators of infants and preschoolers with handicapping conditions. It is a cooperative program between the Exceptional Education, Psychology, and Speech Language Pathology and Audiology departments of the school, and students must take courses focusing on infant specialization from each department. It trains educators to serve both at-risk and preschool children and their families. Project goals are to: teach them to assimilate and use knowledge from many disciplines to assess at-risk infants and preschoolers; plan intervention methods; and work effectively with family  members. Program components include training in infant/preschool assessment, developmental and neonatal intervention, managing family and child stress, and language and communication strategies. Practicum sites include infant and preschool intervention programs and medical and hospital programs. From 1985-1988, 14 educators have graduated from this program and 30 more are enrolled. Appended are a copy of the pre/post specialization questionnaire and a copy of the graduate exit evaluation form. Contains 3 references. (Author/SM)",

Over 200 program lessons have been incorporated into local classrooms, and dissemination has taken place locally through teacher inservice and nationally through five journal articles and conferences. Program materials are used in about 25 states. Lessons have been incorporated into the Curriculum Guides for Biology and Life Science published by the Los Angeles Unified School District. The program consists of lecture-discussion-lecture planning sessions held throughout the school  year and a summer laboratory program. A key to the success of this program is the ability of the research scientists to convey forefront concepts to teachers in an exciting and easily understandable way. All presenters are active researchers and most are winners of teaching awards. Utilization of a Nobel laureate in the program provides great inspiration to the teachers.

It utilizes a statewide educational communications system called the Indiana Higher Education Telecommunication System which has proved to be an ideal medium for the College of Business to tap new markets via the MBA/TV program. The program is designed to meet the needs of currently employed professionals who wish to obtain graduate education in business on a part-time basis. It permits students who do not have access to an accredited MBA program to undertake such work. MBA/TV is broadcast via television with telephone interactive capability. The  courses are available at 51 companies and educational institutions in the state, and 47 students have graduated from this program so far. College of Business professors are required to attend a 2-week workshop to get them adjusted to teaching in front of a camera, create visual material that can be transformed for computer transmission, and use the overhead camera method rather than the traditional blackboard method where the professor blocks the information from the camera's eye. Student evaluations of the program are consistently favorable. (SM)",

        "description":"The cross-disciplinary writing program at West Chester University (WCU), Pennsylvania is a long-range, three-part program designed to increase the amount, variety, and quality of writing done by undergraduates at WCU. It focuses on enhancement rather than remediation and provides for: writing emphasis courses each semester in traditional liberal studies and in professional studies; a general requirement that all students take three of these writing emphasis courses; and in-house lectures, seminars, and workshops on writing for faculty members in all disciplines. A supporting service called &quot;The Writing Consultancy&quot; was developed for students. Faculty in all departments regularly assign writing tasks of various kinds to attain course objectives. Program outcome measures indicate:  WCU students write often and in more various modes; WCU faculty regularly include writing instruction in their courses; and many faculty implement teaching practices in which writing is used as a means of learning the academic discipline. Among specific recommendations for implementing such a program are that: it be designed to include components of faculty development, curriculum development, student services, and effective administration; it publish newsletters, handbooks, and aids for students and faculty; and on-going assessment be conducted for quality control. The faculty handbook for the writing program, comprising over two-thirds of the document, is appended. (SM)",

        "description":"In this study, children's selective attention to, and comprehension of, variably-paced television programs were examined as a function of sound effects. Sixty-four children, equally distributed by sex and by preschool and fourth grades, were randomly assigned to one of four treatment conditions which crossed two levels of sound effects (presence versus absence) with two levels of program pace (high versus low rate of scene change). It was found that sound effects increased children's selective attention to key program actions which, in turn, predicted children's comprehension of targeted story events. Effects were most pronounced in the rapidly-paced television program, particularly for the younger age group. The results suggest that young children's comprehension of  rapidly-paced television programs can benefit if attention is guided selectively to significant story actions by sound effects.

An introductory section explains the purpose of the Open University; its history and principles; its programs of study; its teaching methods and media; technology in its teaching system (print, broadcasting, audiocassettes, videocassettes, computers, videodiscs, and satellites); its costs; and external recognition of the open university system. A second part presents two case studies illustrating how the OU teaches about technology at the undergraduate and professional levels. In the first example, course components (applications areas, technical and social &quot;tributaries,&quot; role of the television programs, and policy for home  computing) are explained. The second example offers a description of a series of 12 short practical courses aimed at updating professional engineers in the manufacturing industry. The paper concludes with a discussion of key factors in developing an open university: (1) the need for a relatively large number of students to justify the large initial cost of designing quality distance teaching materials; (2) the apparent fact that quality costs money; (3) the need for working in conjunction with industry and government; (4) the importance of designing a complete system for open learning; and (5) the need for consistent and high-level political support for open universities.

A national sample of about 4,500 mature students who were taking a wide range of courses--from evening classes to full-time higher degrees--completed detailed questionnaires eliciting information on their background and educational experiences. Among those students sampled was a substantial number of distance students who form the subject matter of this paper. In order to discover the extent to which student populations vary, the students were divided into five groups: Open University undergraduates; Open University associate students; National Extension College students; NALGO Correspondence  Institute students (a trade union for public sector employees); and private correspondence students. Following the return of the questionnaires, data were analyzed and summarized in 12 tables according to the following variables: age, sex, employment status, current educational qualifications, social class, subject of study, level of course, reason for taking the course, father's social class, qualifications held on leaving school, educational mobility, and social mobility. Results indicated that the student populations were very diverse, and it is suggested that each institution needs to survey its own student population when designing distance courses, rather than relying on findings from elsewhere.

        "description":"Biases based on gender and ethnicity in computer software available to schools were investigated in this study. A random sample of 15 software programs were selected and evaluated on the bases of gender and ethnicity. Data were gathered on the number of male and female characters portrayed and on the cross-cultural dimensions of the software in order to determine if it would appeal to a cross section of children from varying backgrounds, or whether it had been prepared with a particular audience in mind, e.g., Anglo-Saxon males. The data showed that, from a quantitative perspective, patterns of gender and ethnic imbalance previously documented in textbooks are also present in current educational software available to students. Of the 1,942 characters noted in the graphics and  text of the evaluated software, 63% were males and only 3% of the characters could be identified as ethnic. In order to clearly understand the dimensions of these biases, a quantitative examination of the roles and activities found within the software was undertaken. Similar ethnicity and gender trends were found, with males dominating the character roles (63%) while observable ethnic characters were limited to only 3%. When these roles and activities were divided into separate categories, males were portrayed in more categories, and as more active characters, including adventure, military, and science and technology roles, while females were limited to 41 more passive roles. Ethnic roles were also limited, but ethnic female roles were even more limited than ethnic males roles. (5 tables,  a list of the 15 evaluated software packages, and 6 references) (EW)",

        "description":"Arguing that sufficient theory exists about the interplay between human information processing, computer systems, and the demands of various tasks to construct useful theories of human-computer interaction, this study presents a structural model of human-computer interaction and reports the results of various statistical analyses of this model. Male and female subjects (N=109) were asked to complete the numerical, spatial, and logical subscales of the California Test of Mental Maturity (CTMM), which represented measurable variables, and their total scores were used to indicate various latent variables of the model, including decision time and errors. Upon completing the CTMM, subjects solved a variety of problems presented via computer, i.e., locating a number, interpolation,  forecasting, and trend analysis. Mean problem-solving times for each of the four problem types were used as indicators of the decision time latent variable, and the average number of errors for each of the four problem types served as indicators of the errors latent variable. A correlation matrix of the measured variables was computed and analyzed with LISREL VI. A sub-model of the primary model of human-computer interactions was used to assess the relationship between various measures of intelligence and problem-solving behavior. Statistical tests--chi-square, goodness-of-fit index, rho, and the root mean square residual--were used to test the hypothesis that the model was plausible for explaining the relationships that existed in the data. Chi-square for the model indicated that the  model did not fit the data. However, a final model presented in the study fit quite nicely according to both inferential and descriptive tests. Three researcher biographies and three figures--a causal user model, the structural model that was tested, and the final causal model--are included. (4 references) (CGD)",

The importance of the development and implementation of standards in interactive library activities for librarians using state or regional telecommunications networks is then discussed, including such factors as the need for increased functionality, performance reliability, consistent user assistance, access, and participation in governance. Also discussed are the activities of the various regional networks involved in the Linked Systems Project (LSP), including the development of standards for information transfer  between systems via the telecommunications standard known as the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI). The development of the Office of Library Program's leadership role in interlibrary cooperation, especially in the application of federal funding to inter- and intra-state cooperative programs for resource sharing, is also described. A concluding statement briefly discusses a number of issues currently involved in networking, and 10 recommendations are offered for the guidance of the Office of Library Programs in working toward the development of an underlying information infrastructure parallel with the telecommunications infrastructure being created by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other federal agencies.

These include subject centered methods, measurably stated objectives  approaches, decision-making strategies, and problem solving procedures.

Course-integrated instruction requires close cooperation between the librarian and the instructor and subject expertise on the part of the librarian. Such cooperation normally grows out of course-related instruction. Whatever the assignment given, its goal should be to introduce students to a wide span of library resources and to make them comfortable in using these sources. Course-integrated instruction permits library research at a deeper level which allows for a more cognitive approach to research methodology. However, this type of library instruction is also time  consuming for the librarian involved in the instruction, who may have to meet with the instructor several times and grade the library assignment. Nevertheless, as libraries continue to grow and become more complex, the demands for such instruction will increase, and academic librarians must be prepared to meet them. (9 references) (EW)",

The first of four parts of the report describes recent court decisions on copyright infringement by states which prompted the request for the Copyright Office to conduct this study. The second part describes the materials in 44 public comments received in response to a Copyright Office Request for Information on states' immunity from suit for money damages in copyright infringement cases that was published in the Federal Register. The legal interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment, which makes up the major part of the report, is presented in the  third part. This interpretation is divided into three subsections: the historic development of Eleventh Amendment law; the Eleventh Amendment in the twentieth century; and application of the Eleventh Amendment in copyright infringement suits against the states. In the fourth part, it is concluded that, although Congress intended to hold states responsible under federal copyright law, the present state of the law will not be sufficiently clear on how the appropriate remedy against states can and will be secured for copyright owners until certain points of law have been decided in currently pending litigation. Appended materials include a copy of the Request for Information, a discussion of the English common law concept of sovereign immunity, and a Congressional Research Service report on  the waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity in individual states.

Generally, proposals that address the improvement of community colleges' baccalaureate preparation and transfer functions focus on either \"nonstructural\" or \"structural\" reforms. Nonstructural reforms include: (1) providing more personal and extensive tutoring, developing new kinds of remedial courses, and setting time limits for the completion of remedial coursework; (2) encouraging faculty-student interaction out of class, integrating students' jobs and academic life, and scheduling students in blocks of classes; (3) providing better transfer advising, exposing potential transfer students to four-year  colleges, improving financial aid, and making it easier to transfer vocational credits; and (4) reducing post-transfer attrition by accepting more credits and improving the social integration of transfer students on campus. Structural reforms, on the other hand, recognize that obstacles to baccalaureate attainment exist in the organization, as well as the operations, of community colleges. Three main proposals have been made for changing the colleges' structure: ending the comprehensive nature of the community college and focusing strictly on its vocational-technical role; converting community colleges into two-year branch campuses of state universities; and converting community colleges into four-year colleges. The structural reforms will require further debate, but the comparatively  uncontroversial nonstructural reforms can be implemented immediately to achieve significant and relatively immediate benefits.

Part I highlights the following issues of concern to the college: the changing nature of the workplace, new providers of postsecondary education, increased state pressure for a comprehensive college mission, and changes in local economic, social, and demographic structures. Specific challenges facing WITCC are identified as the lack of a strong arts and sciences program, stable enrollment levels and high attrition, the need for additional facilities to accommodate the call for an expanded mission, and the need to develop external financial resources in a more systematic and  comprehensive fashion. Part II discusses options and offers recommendations for dealing with these challenges. The key recommendation is that WITCC participate in a PIER (Preparation, Implementation, Evaluation, and Refinement) strategic planning process to introduce necessary changes over a five-year period. Under this plan, the college will establish a comprehensive arts and sciences program as early as possible, upgrade the vocational-technical education curriculum, create a systematic approach to resource development, devote more attention to student services, and develop a better approach to serving the occupational development needs of high school students.

The program was initiatied in fall 1985 in response to increasing numbers of entering freshmen with inadequate reading and writing skills and subsequent high rates of attrition. Focusing initially on students with high school grade point average of less than 2.0, the program provided the following: an intake interview to review students' high school records and achievement test scores; pre-enrollment counseling to clarify program expectations and assess students' attitudes toward college; an assessment of students' basic skills in reading, writing, and mathematics; credit-bearing courses in math and study skills, and paired reading and writing  courses; a learning laboratory; an exit interview with a counselor if students decided to change their curriculum or withdraw from the program; and competency-based instruction and flexible completion strategies. Results from the first year of program operations indicated that it was possible to both increase students' reading, math, and English proficiencies in as little as 30 weeks, and to improve student retention while maintaining academic standards. Data from the three years of operation of the project suggest that virtually every student who persists for up to three terms in the College Skills Program will reach competency in reading and writing and will be able to handle freshman-level course content.

Most community college presidents have the following qualifications and characteristics: administrative experience, usually in supervising faculty; willingness to move from one institution or geographic area to another; a doctorate degree from an accredited, preferably non-experiential, institution; a significant publishing record; a demonstrated ability to speak before large  audiences; experience in dealing with personnel and, in some states, collective bargaining; experience in the preparation, analysis, and management of budgets; active roles in community service and professional organizations; and credible references. In addition to gaining these qualifications, the aspiring president should develop a resume that includes a statement of his/her managerial and educational philosophy; complete the application form carefully; gather background information on the college and the previous president's reasons for leaving before and during the interview; anticipate questions and be prepared to answer them candidly; and analyze the interview.

        "author":["Earwaker, John"],
        "description":"Until recently, the model of student support operating at Sheffield City Polytechnic (SCP) in England involved pairing each student with a tutor, defining an entitlement of time for the student, specifying a minimum time commitment for which the tutor is required to be available, and leaving it up to the tutor and student to get together as best they can. A number of factors have put this personal tutorial system under great strain, including the tutors' other responsibilities for research and course development, the premium placed upon career advice, financial constraints, the development of unit-based course structures, and the invalidation of unspoken assumptions about the characteristics of polytechnic students and their needs for support. In many departments, the lecturer  with overall responsibility for the first year of a particular course was becoming a key figure in student support. Yet in most cases, the first-year tutors, if not actually ill-equipped, felt ill-prepared for such a role. In view of all of these difficulties, it was proposed that a unit for tutorial development be created to: (1) insure that tutors have adequate information about SCP; (2) assist teaching staff in their role as tutors to individual students; (3) offer professional support to tutors and establish links with external agencies which offer advice to students; (4) provide training opportunities for staff to update their knowledge and skills and enhance their understanding of student problems; and (5) advise course leaders and course planning committees. There can be no  possibility of implementing such a far-reaching scheme until the school's current funding upheavals have subsided. In the immediate future, efforts shall focus on investigating tutors' problems and practices, preparing training materials, learning how students help each other, and examining course induction procedures. In addition, staff members with an interest in student support will be eligible for enrollment in a newly created course in &quot;Study Support and Tutoring.&quot; (ALB)",

        "author":["Crook, David B.",
          "Lavin, David E."],
        "description":"To date, much of the research on the community college's effect on baccalaureate degree (B.A.) attainment has been based on the assumption that the educational attainment process occurs in the same way at two- and four-year institutions. However, the distinctive mission and clientele of community colleges create a different environment than that of a typical four-year college, and, as a result, some predictors of B.A. attainment may behave differently in the two contexts. Data gathered in a 14-year longitudinal study of students who first entered the City University of New York in the early 1970s indicate that the community college effect may not act uniformly on all types of students. Several variables were analyzed, including students' gender, ethnicity, age at entry, family  income, father's education, high school grades, high school academic preparation courses, academic self-confidence, orientation to higher education, degree aspirations, employment status, amount of remediation needed, first-year grade point average, and baccalaureate attainment. Study findings included the following: (1) students who began at the community college level were 21% less likely to earn a B.A. than students who entered a four-year institution; (2) both Blacks and Hispanics were 27% less likely than Whites to earn a B.A.; (3) students who intended to earn an associate degree were 33% less likely to earn a B.A. than students who aimed higher; (4) at senior colleges, Blacks and Whites with the same background characteristics were equally likely to graduate, but among two-year  college entrants, Blacks were at a slight disadvantage; and (5) students who enrolled in the liberal arts at a community college were substantially more likely to earn a B.A. than otherwise comparable students in vocational programs.

        "description":"Over the last six years, corporation-community college partnerships have played an increasingly important role in educational and industrial growth. The automotive industry has been at the forefront of this trend and has recognized the contributions that community colleges can make in meeting the educational needs of industry. One example is the Chrysler Dealer Apprenticeship Program (CAP). The program was initiated to act as a &quot;feeder system&quot; to supply high qualified entry-level technicians to Chrysler dealerships on a national basis. CAP involves a combination of education and work experience, with the student alternately spending two months attending college and two months working at a dealership. At the end of two years, the student receives an Associate in Applied Science  Degree in Automotive Technology and is guaranteed a job with the dealer where the apprenticeship has been served. Colleges interested in establishing a similar program should consider the following problems and needs: (1) general education requirements for associate degrees should be upheld in the program; (2) while students will take all of their automotive technology classes together, they should be encouraged to mix with other students in general education courses; (3) although the corporation provides equipment and faculty training, the need for a special facility dedicated to the project and relatively low class sizes means that the program will be expensive for the college; (4) to protect the corporation's investment, the community college must ensure that its teaching methods are  appropriate, that its faculty remains up to date with new technological developments, and that its graduates are knowledgeable and competent; (5) the dealer must be able to interview and select apprenticeship candidates, though the college must ensure that affirmative action practices are followed; and (6) as the program requires a full-time commitment, employed, part-time students would be eliminated from consideration.

The programs are built on the premise that well-prepared students are more likely to persist through high school and succeed in college. Some of MCCC's efforts have focused on improving communication between college and school personnel, including: (1) the creation of opportunities for local public school administrators to meet and hear experts in the field of education; (2) dinners for high school and college math, science, and English teachers held on the college campus; (3) in-service training to improve the way in which elementary science instructors  teach science and increase their confidence in conducting in-class demonstrations of basic scientific principles; (4) the Distinguished Lecture Series to which high school students and their teachers are invited; (5) the Visiting Lecture Program, which involves MCCC faculty in making presentations to junior and senior high school classes; and (6) one-to-one working relationships between faculty in MCCC's Humanities Division and their counterparts at a local high school. Other activities have been undertaken to promote the academic achievement of junior and senior high school students. These include Career Days, during which practicing professionals talk to students about their fields; the distribution to junior high schools of a brochure on selecting the right high school courses to  prepare for college; the publication of &quot;Aspirations,&quot; a collection of writings by high school students; cooperative planning so that MCCC's theatrical productions can be used as an instructional resource in high school English classes; the operation of a Performing Arts High School on MCCC's campus; and an annual Teen Arts festival of workshops and competitions.

        "description":"In fall 1988, Chemeketa Community College (CCC) of Salem, Oregon, experimented with a new approach to in-service staff development. The new strategy had four purposes: to raise campus awareness of CCC's customers; to promote active, rather than passive, participation in staff development; to bring employees throughout the campus together across departmental and functional lines; and to generate new and specific strategies for meeting student and community needs. CCC's full-time staff was divided into 50 small groups, each including representatives from various college divisions and organizational levels. Then, a focus group consisting of a carefully selected cross-section of CCC students was asked to discuss how well the college was meeting its stated goals. The focus group's  discussion was broadcast live campus-wide to locations where the small groups were gathered. After viewing the broadcast, each small group met for two hours under the guidance of a trained facilitator to: (1) identify and assign priority to the issues that had been raised by the focus group; (2) discuss ideas for improving campus services; and (3) arrive at some type of &quot;Action Plan&quot; addressing one or more of these issues. Subsequently, a second focus group comprised of community representatives was formed and its discussion was broadcast to the campus. The small groups then attempted to revise their original action plan or devise a new plan. Two weeks later, a report was presented and disseminated, and a series of campus-wide open forums were set up to deal with specific needs, such as  child care and high school relations. By May 1989, over half a dozen action plans, ranging from the simple to the complex, had been implemented by the small group members. (ALB)",

In-depth interviews were conducted with 17 women who had been identified as exceptional in that they either persisted and graduated even though they had been initially identified as \"high risk\" (N=9) or voluntarily withdrew in spite of an initial identification as \"low risk.\" One of the recurring themes in their interviews involved writing and writing assignments as part of their college experience. The institutional persisters indicated that writing assignments requiring them to explore their feelings, goals, and thoughts had a positive influence on them. These assignments gave them an opportunity to analyze their  reasons for attending college and boosted their self-confidence. For the persisters, courses requiring writing assignments were also positive experiences, especially when class assignments required students to interview others, research topics, discuss self-awareness, and articulate their goals. The leavers, on the other hand, reported difficulty in writing certain types of papers and felt writing was a barrier to their continued enrollment in college. (ALB)",

First, background information is presented on the college and the role of the research office in management, decision-making, and educational support. Next, the organizational structure of the district is explained, with particular emphasis on the role of the director of research and planning within the college's Planning Council and Research Committee. After exploring the relationships between the research office and other college departments, the paper discusses the researcher's role as campus and team leader. The next section explains the operations of the centralized research model on  campus, highlighting: (1) the annual development of a research agenda of specific priorities and studies to be conducted; (2) staffing of the research office by a full-time director and administrative secretary and up to 12 part-time or grant-funded staff members in various positions; and (3) reporting, disseminating, and utilizing research findings. After acknowledging that the research study process has differed slightly for each study conducted, the paper offers examples of two studies that exemplify the standard structure. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of the centralized model are reviewed, highlighting the elimination of redundancy, the easy identification of gaps in research knowledge, and the potential for the isolation of the researchers from the programs and services  they are studying.

        "description":"The issues of sexual harassment and appropriate sexual conduct have caused nationwide interest in ethics in academia. Questions of the appropriateness of sexual relationships between faculty and students, and between supervisors and employees, are both legal and ethical in nature. The Supreme Court has ruled that the most important factor in determining the merit of a sexual harassment case is whether the conduct was &quot;welcome.&quot; However, the defense of consensuality is not viable when one partner in the relationship has power over the other. Supervisors, administrators, faculty, and/or staff may be liable in three possible situations: (1) a relationship that started out as &quot;welcome&quot; may become unwelcome; (2) the parents of a student involved in a sexual relationship with a faculty  member may complain about the inappropriateness of the relationship; and (3) classmates of a student involved with an instructor may claim unequal treatment. The creation of an academic environment free of unethical conduct may be approached by formally adopting a code of ethics, and/or adding a statement about appropriate sexual relationships to existing sexual harassment policies. The University of Hawaii's community college system is in the process of doing both. Faculty senates on all six campuses have adopted the American Association of University Professors' Statement on Professional Ethics and are currently modifying their sexual harassment policy to indicate that sexual relationships between faculty/supervisors and students/employees, even by mutual consent, may be grounds for  disciplinary action. Adopting a code of professional ethics does not guarantee ethical behavior, but it demonstrates that the college is committed to ensuring an ethical academic community. (JMC)",

        "description":"Focus group research, which involves the exploration of a carefully selected research question by a group of homogeneous subjects, is a qualitative research tool which seems to be a quick and easy means of staying abreast of the educational needs and expectations of community colleges. However, it is difficult to moderate focus groups and interpret their results, and, therefore, focus group research is often misused. To be successful and avoid inherent pitfalls, focus group research should follow three guidelines: (1) collegewide administrative procedures should be established for all focus group research, including provisions for the authorization of focus group research, the selection and training of focus group moderators, the recruitment of focus group subjects, and the  appropriate interpretation of focus group results; (2) the focus group moderator should be a professionally trained member of the community college faculty and staff, rather than a marketing consultant from an outside agency who generally lacks understanding of the nature or scope of a community college and, as a result, often misinterprets the group members' answers; and (3) the process of interpreting focus group results must be carefully monitored and regulated, with particular caution taken in drawing conclusions from focus group responses. Maintaining a consistent methodology and deriving results from multiple focus groups of the same population will make focus group research a more valuable and worthwhile endeavor. (ALB)",

Four indicators of student demand were examined in the study. First, enrollments were analyzed in terms of the changes that took place in the fall opening headcount of students enrolled in various program areas. Second, enrollment patterns were investigated with respect to changes that occurred in the number of credit hours taken per broad programmatic funding category. Third, the number of students completing programs was examined to determine whether shifts had occurred in the types of programs being completed. Fourth, the ratio of program completers to program  enrollments was determined. Study findings included the following: (1) during the four-year period, community college enrollments decreased, especially in adult secondary education, general studies, and the general associate degree, while the number of students completing programs increased; (2) in the baccalaureate/transfer program, fall headcount enrollments, credit hour production, program completions, and ratio of completions to headcount all increased; (3) the number of credit hours generated by courses decreased in all areas except for the growth in adult basic education and baccalaureate/transfer, and the relative stability in remedial enrollments; and (4) the occupational program with the most demand was business, followed by health, trade and industrial education, and engineering  technology.

        "description":"In response to legislative mandate and pressure from its accrediting agency, Blue Ridge Community College (BRCC) began to develop a system to measure the effectiveness of its instructional programs. The system was designed to improve curricula, be managed by faculty, be inexpensive and uncomplicated, and focus on qualitative rather than quantitative measures. The first steps in the generation of the assessment plan were the appointment of an Assessment Committee, composed of five faculty members, two division chairs, and the registrar; the preparation and state approval of the assessment plan; the provision of release time for faculty to teach other faculty about new assessment requirements; and full meetings of the faculty to garner support. The assessment plan requires that  faculty members: (1) design a system for evaluating their own programs that provides for the measurement of student outcomes at matriculation, during enrollment, at graduation, and at some point during the subsequent five-year period; (2) submit the program evaluation plan to the Assessment Committee for approval; (3) implement the plan on a four-year cycle and provide data and a written report on outcomes to the Faculty Curriculum Committee; (4) alter program content according to evaluation results or explain to their peers why changes should not be made. Currently, all of BRCC's occupational programs have developed assessment plans that have been documented and approved, though most were rejected upon their first submission to the Assessment Committee. A wide variety of variables,  measures, and data sources have been chosen, though most departments have elected to use ad hoc surveys, standardized placement tests, and other straightforward methods to gather data. The advent of assessment has led the faculty at BRCC to reconsider and expand its role in governance, college planning, personnel changes, and decision making. (JMC)",

Chapter 2 summarizes leadership theory and offers a discussion of transformational leadership and its place in a rapidly changing society. After chapter 3 reviews the study methodology, chapters 4 and 5 present findings on the demographic and leadership characteristics of the presidents selected for in-depth study. Chapters 6 through 10  discuss key elements of transformational leadership, including shared vision, teamwork and collaborative decision making, institutional climate and the relationship between the institution and the individuals within it, motivation as a means of achieving followers' acceptance of the shared vision, and personal values, integrity, and commitment to learning. Chapter 11 examines women in community college leadership roles. Finally, chapter 12 presents a summary of the research, a discussion of the problems faced by minority leaders, and a review of study implications.

        "description":"The idea of general education has ebbed and flowed for generations. Recent calls for general education, appearing both in the professional and popular literature, demand an integrative curriculum that brings people toward common understandings. The content of what is taught matters less than that a continual effort be made to enhance social cohesion and move students toward a realization that participation in the polity is important. In Japan, school environments direct students toward such a sense of social responsibility; in the United States, and especially in community colleges, the curriculum must carry the general education message. Since the community college curriculum centers on the liberal arts and occupational studies, general education must be diffused throughout  these areas. The colleges have effectually reconceptualized the liberal arts in the direction of general education, and have had some success in suffusing general education concepts into occupational studies. However, constant attention must be paid to general education because the courses keep drifting away from the disciplines from which they arose. General education is difficult to teach because, by definition, it is broad and integrative; and it is futile to insist on it as a graduation requirement because so few students graduate. Overcoming these dilemmas, answering the question of what knowledge everyone should possess, and assessing the outcomes of general education demands leadership from within the institution rather than directives from the state level. Integrated,  self-contained, interdisciplinary general education courses should be required for everyone coming to the institution, and their outcomes assessed globally, in order to bring a greater understanding of the broader society and of the student's place within it.

        "description":"The intersection of the ethnographer's method of participant observation and the historian's central concern with chronology provides a potentially useful approach for construction of a historical ethnography of childhood through oral history. The first stage of ethnographic activity, fieldwork centered in participant observation, is not unlike the process which occurs each time the oral historian knocks on the door of a potential interviewee. The face-to-face encounter inevitably combines participation with observation, and subjectivity with objectivity. The subjective-objective dialectic inherent in both ethnography and oral history makes the second phase of research, the representation of texts obtained in the field, a matter of critical importance. This second stage embodies  particular complexities, for each participant observer takes from the field not only data, but also a sense of responsibility as to its best representation, or textualization. The oral historian, however, must also engage in an ongoing dialectic between past and present. Once recollections are interpreted as to what they have to tell about the present, attention must be given to interpretation of the past, as far as possible in its own terms. At this point, insights derived from the concept of participant observation must be broadened if the historical ethnography of childhood is to be constructed. (RH)",

For example, how and what children learn about money epitomize many of the differences between everyday and school-based problem solving. The general goals of this paper are to characterize the problem-solving strategies used by children in stores and to show that the knowledge children have is a consequence of the ways in which they use that knowledge. Specific goals are to: (1) describe the situated use of money in both natural settings and the classroom; (2) describe the development of children's knowledge of money between preschool and the end of second grade; (3) relate children's knowledge of money to  the ways in which they use money; and (4) describe some ways in which children reconcile what they know about money as it is used in and out of school. Discussion is based on observations of children's behavior in stores and classrooms, and interviews with parents and children. Implications for educational practice are briefly discussed. (RH)",

        "description":"This study used several measures to compare 40 toddlers with delays in expressive language and 40 children acquiring language normally. Findings indicated that children with small expressive vocabularies at 2 years of age are not different from their normally speaking peers in terms of hearing, history of ear infections, birth order, or pre- or peri-natal history. They do tend to come from families with a history of language or learning disorders. In addition, children with small expressive vocabularies: (1) appear to have subtle deficits in nonverbal problem solving despite having normal intelligence; (2) are very likely to show deficits in social maturity; (3) seem somewhat less motivated than normally speaking children to interact with others; (4) are perceived by their  parents as being hyperactive and more difficult to manage than normal toddlers; and (5) show less phonological skill, in terms of syllable structures produced and number of different consonants used. Preliminary outcome data suggest that children with small vocabularies at 2 years of age are at moderate risk for language delay that continues until at least 3 years of age. They are at somewhat higher risk of articulation deficit at age 3. Social immaturity persists to this age. (RH)",

The sample of television analyzed included 72 hours of programing and advertisements obtained from Cornell's HDTV Archive. Program characters with speaking lines, and characters in a crowd of five or more, were coded according to age, race, gender, occupation, and speaking or nonspeaking role. Primary program role was included as a coded variable to differentiate between the occupation and major function of each character. Also assessed were the frequency of minority-white interactions, and the tone and context of those interactions. Each instance of cross-racial interaction was judged to be positive or  negative in tone, and social or professional in context. Findings were strikingly similar to those reported in previous content analyses. The nature of minority protrayals has remained virtually unchanged. Character analysis revealed several ways in which television minorities were less prestigious than whites. Cross-racial friendships among youth were commonplace outside of the class. In comparison with youths' cross-racial relations, adults' were predominately positive, but tended to be limited to less voluntary, job-related situations. (RH)",

        "description":"The cutoff method was used on longitudinal data in more than one content domain in a study attempting to determine whether the effects of schooling are general or limited. Conservation of number, an informally acquired skill, and mental addition, a formally acquired skill, were evaluated among older kindergarten children, younger 1st-grade children, and older lst-grade children. Older kindergarten children and younger 1st-grade children were about the same age; younger and older lst-grade children had the same amount of schooling. The conservation data indicated that improvements in performance were due primarily to age rather than schooling, and improvements in the accuracy of mental addition were due primarily to schooling rather than age. This pattern of results has three  implications: (1) young and old children are equally ready to benefit from the kinds of counting and arithmetic operations that are emphasized in school; (2) schooling seems to have relatively specific effects on performance; and (3) the cutoff method can be quite useful for discovering which kinds of skills are acquired as a function of schooling or age, and for addressing questions about children's readiness for acquiring certain kinds of knowledge. It is concluded that as results accumulate, priority should be given to the construction of a coherent picture of the effects of early schooling on cognitive and academic development. (RH)",

        "description":"During paroxysms of colic, infants are hypertonic or neurolabile, and appear to be in acute, abdominal pain. The infant lets out a high-pitched cry which soon reaches a screaming level, and which is coupled with facial grimacing. The infant is difficult to console, and may resist attempts to sooth it. Between spells, these infants cry normally and are not hypertonic. Recent research suggests that infants with true colic represent a subgroup of infants with excessive crying. Findings indicate that colic and excessive crying can be differentiated by physical and behavioral criteria. Mothers of infants with colic perceive their infant's cry as being different from that of other infants, and rate their infants as having a difficult temperament. From a pediatric point of view, colic  appears to be an imbalance of the autonomic nervous system, particularly of the dynamic interplay between sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. From a developmental point of view, this autonomic imbalance could be related to the broad spectrum of changes in neurological and behavioral function that occur around the second month: the so-called biobehavioral shift from basic physiological regulation to the beginnings of social regulation. What is triggered by crying as a biologically based condition may develop into crying as mediated by social-emotional factors in the parents. (RH)",

Social problem-solving skills of 300 subjects from three suburban elementary schools in a middle class community in northern California were assessed each year using one of two hypothetical-reflective interview measures: one focusing on interpersonal conflicts over the use of resources; the other on problems of object acquisition and peer group entry. Measures of social adjustment were obtained from teacher ratings and classroom sociometric assessments. Findings indicated that children of both sexes became increasingly skilled at solving common interpersonal problems, with the greatest change  occurring between kindergarten and second grade. Children became increasingly assertive and effective in problem-solving responses, relying more on prosocial strategies and less on aggressive strategies or giving up. Children also increased in range of responses and ability to respond with a new strategy when initial attempts failed. Finally, children improved in their understanding of problem situations and the consequences of actions, and were more likely to interpret situations in terms of the needs and feelings of those involved.

It was hypothesized that a good fit and favorable developmental outcome would result when organismic and environmental variables were in accord. Subjects were 113 mothers between 19 to 44 years of age. Findings indicated that all aspects of maternal adaptation except coping were significantly predicted: low degrees of managability predicted high degrees of  irritability, and low managability expectations predicted low 4-month role satisfaction. Predictions could be made over a 6-month period. Infant temperament was more important than maternal expectations. The Goodness of Fit model was not supported. (RH)",

        "description":"The purpose of this ongoing study is to assess the impact of style of coping, self-image, family environment, and perceptions of parenting skills on the adaptation of adolescents to the stressors of parenthood. A total of 27 adolescent mothers and their infants, and a cohort of 16 pregnant teens, have thus far participated in the study. Each of the adolescents completed the Ways of Coping Scale-revised (WCS), the Offer Self-Image Questionnaire (OSIQ), the Family Environment Scale (FES), and several scales assessing pre- and post-natal perceptions of caretaking. Infants were administered a Gesell Developmental screening at 9 months of age. The mean OSIQ and FES case profiles indicate a generalized disruption of self-image and perceptions of family environment. However, the profile  is not as disrupted for pregnant teens as for mothers. Pregnant teens' preference for emotion-based coping styles in dealing with the stressors of having a baby may partially account for these profile differences. The preliminary results also suggest that the disruption of self-image and the use of less effective forms of coping are related to negative attitudes toward caretaking. The data support the importance of examining how individual differences in coping styles affect caretaking perceptions, attitudes, and behavior. (RH)",

Participants were 55 middle-class, mostly college-educated mothers of 3-to-4-year-old children. A total of 31 children were girls. Mothers operated a computer program which presented, in a random order, 12 common child misbehaviors. Misbehaviors, which occurred in public and private, concerned breaking rules, aggression, taking others' property, and temper tantrums. Mothers estimated how often their children engaged in each misbehavior and the likelihood that they would respond to their children's misbehavior with reasoning, a time-out, or physical punishment. A 30-item attitude questionnaire was used to assign mothers into  attitude groups. Mothers were classified as having positive, ambivalent, or negative attitudes toward physical punishment. Findings indicate that for most mothers, both the distal variable of attitude toward physical punishment and the proximate variables of immediate considerations need to be studied if an understanding of parental behavioral intentions and behavior is to be reached. Findings also suggest that the relationship between distal and proximate variables is not necessarily isomorphic. (RH)",

Even through U.S. corporations transfer over 400,000 households annually, there is little research on the effects of such moves on employees' children. This study tested hypotheses drawn from child development theory regarding the effect of environmental stability on children's adjustment in the social, behavioral, school, physical health, and self-confidence domains. The study's longitudinal design made it possible to contrast the effect of a move and the effect of normal maturational changes on adjustment in each developmental domain. Results revealed no short-term negative effect of moving, and no negative effect of frequent moves. But the study did  suggest that number of moves positively affected mobile children's behavioral adjustment and that fathers' well-being was an important predictor of mobile children's behavior. Findings supported the theoretical perspective that children who have coped well with prior environmental changes in a corporate relocation are best prepared to cope with subsequent relocations.

For 6 weeks, 22 target children in 7 classes were observed while they interacted with peers during free play. Comparisons on measures of significant social behaviors revealed that types of relationships were qualitatively distinct. Target children interacted most often wih best friends, and more often with associates than with acquaintances. As level of association increased, self-disclosures increased and disagreements decreased. Fantasy play, a group activity, was engaged in equally often with best friends  and associates, but rarely with acquaintances. These results are consistent with the theory that children have a process view of relationships and selectively choose behaviors within the context of preferred relationships that serve to maintain those particular relationships over time.

        "description":"A study examined the social status of the members of the social sets of preschool children. For 8 weeks, interactions of 3- and 4-year-olds were observed in 8 classrooms. Interaction scores were standardized, and members of each social set were identified as popular, average, or unpopular. Findings indicated that for 3- and 4-year-olds, 39% and 47% respectively of the social sets consisted of same-status peers. The majority of social sets consisted of similar status peers. A total of 9.1% of the social sets consisted of low social status peers only, with 76.5% of the unpopular children being in social sets with higher status peers. Similarity of social status within social sets tended to increase with age. Thus, subsystems based on social status may begin to emerge in preschool,  and provide different socialization experiences for different children. Stability of social status increases with age, as do similarity of social status and cohesiveness within the social sets. Therefore, late preschool may be a critical time for intervention strategies that take into account the social milieu of the child. (RH)",

        "description":"In an investigation of 1-year-olds' ability to plan a sequence of steps, 20 infants were administered a compound means-ends problem. In a planning condition, a barrier was placed in front of a cloth at the far end of which was placed one end of a long string. A toy was fastened to the other end of the string and was placed on a table at some distance from the cloth. To retrieve the toy, the infant had to remove the barrier, pull the cloth, and grasp and pull the string. In a control condition, the same arrangement of barrier, support, and string was used, but the toy was visibly separate from the string. Each infant was given five trials on both conditions with order counterbalanced. Findings revealed that when the toy was fastened to the string, infants were more likely to  remove the barrier without playing with it, were quicker to reach for the support, and retrieved the string more frequently. When the toy was separate from the string, infants played more with the barrier, were much slower to contact the support, and often failed to retrieve the string. Order of task had no effect on performance. Results indicate that 12-month-olds are able to plan a series of steps to achieve a goal, and are not restricted to the use of trial-and-error methods in which problems can only be solved by proceeding one step at a time.

        "description":"A total of 83 children of 27 to 63 months of age were interviewed in an effort to assess the importance of the children's understanding of gender constancy and their use of physical characteristics in making gender role stereotype attributions. It was hypothesized that young children would use stimulus models' sex to a greater extent than the models' physical attributes in attributing gender role stereotypes. It was predicted that the number of gender role stereotypes children accurately attributed would be significantly related to sex differences between the figures used in the attribution task, but not related to the physical or relative size of the stimulus or to the children's stage of gender constancy. Findings indicated that all children, but especially boys, correctly  identified and attributed more gender role stereotypes based on the sex than on the relative size of stimulus figures. Children's stage of gender constancy understanding did not reliably predict children's gender role stereotype attribution activity. The pattern of findings suggests that young children are capable of gender-typed attributions well before they achieve a full sense of gender constancy understanding. (RH)",

        "description":"This study focused on the influence of gender schemas on children's abilities to focus their attention away from or toward stimuli containing the dimension of gender. Children identified as gender schematic and aschematic participated in a nonreversal discrimination learning paradigm in which one relevant dimension was gender-relevant and another was gender-irrelevant. Subjects were 67 children of 3 to 9 years of age. Children participated in a nonreversal concept learning task and a schematic processing task that resulted in two indices of gender schematic processing: facilitated and inhibited choices. Findings support predictions of gender schema theory regarding differences between the salience of gender for gender schematic and aschematic children. Gender schematic children  found it difficult to refocus their attention away from a previously rewarded, gender-relevant dimension to a subsequently rewarded nongender-relevant dimension, but easily made a dimensional transition from a nongender-relevant dimension to one that was gender-relevant. Gender aschematic children's abilities to refocus their attention from one stimulus dimension to another appeared to be uninfluenced by the gender-relevance of the dimension. Children's abilities to refocus their attention to a new stimulus dimension differed as a function of their gender schematicity and the type of dimensional shift required. (RH)",

These changes have had a great impact on students and their personal adjustments and coping skills. Among the various concerns of high school students are home and family situations, personal problems, school related issues, and the effects of after school employment. A study was conducted to assess the attitudes of 450 students in 15 high schools in rural middle Tennessee concerning family life, parent relationships, individual social adjustment, and employment  habits. An 18-item questionnaire to collect information about the students included the following: school absences; family structures; reasons for considering dropping out; reasons for considering running away from home; who is at home after school; communicating with parents; perceptions of parental discipline; contemplating suicide; parents working away from home; reasons for depression; drug and alcohol use and reasons for use; after-school employment; use of earnings; and the effect of working on grades.

The farm and rural crises of the 1980s are not short-term aberrations, but symptoms of long-term trends that were partially hidden by the relatively good times for agriculture and rural areas in the 1970s. The social and economic bases of rural America are at risk of permanent alteration or loss. Decisions are being made everyday that affect the viability of rural America as a place to work and live. These decisions are being made without adequate knowledge of the social and economic processes affecting agriculture and rural communities. A better understanding of these processes is necessary to maintain and improve life in  rural America, to increase income, and to secure jobs for the future. Acquiring the necessary knowledge calls for a major research initiative on the complex relationships between agriculture, the rural economy, rural families, and rural communities. The Task Force on Agriculture and Community Viability has designed a research program to provide rural residents and private and public leaders with the information needed to develop public policies for viable systems of agriculture and support for rural Americans. This guide outlines the issues and related questions and research agenda of the program. Also included are the interagency connections for research support, research resources, and implementation procedures. This document contains 43 references. (ALL)",

Severing the link between rural Mexican households and U.S. labor markets would require restructuring not only affecting U.S. industries, which are the focus of federal immigration reform, but also migrant-sending economies in Mexico. If effectively enforced, immigration reforms in the United States also will have an impact on Mexico's urban labor markets, to which many Mexico-U.S. migrants would turn for employment if they were no longer able to work in the United States. Thus, efforts to stem the flow of Mexican immigration through increased enforcement of federal immigration laws such as the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 would face powerful economic pressures in Mexico as  well as in the American Southwest. Economic development in Mexico may be the only effective deterrent to illegal Mexico-U.S. migration. People who have favorable income opportunities in Mexico are less likely to migrate illegally to the United States than those who do not. As long as vast disparities in economic opportunity separate Mexico and the United States, a significant flow of Mexican labor appears to be almost inevitable. These considerations suggest that large-scale economic development programs in Mexico should be promoted as a counterpart to U.S. immigration reforms. Two more reasons for seeking a development solution to illegal Mexico-U.S. migration are the heavy dependence of rural Mexico on income from migrants in the United States and the importance to the United States of  maintaining economic and political stability in Mexico.

The information, for the most part, focuses on the period from 1980 to 1987 and is categorized into five sections: Population, Households, Families and Health; Employment; Income and Taxes; and Miscellaneous Ohio Information. Much of the data throughout the book is organized by county. Topic areas include: percent population change; turnaround counties, 1970-1980 and 1980-1987; percent net migration; annual average crude birth rate; population under 18; population over 50; and median age. A brief analysis indicates Ohio's population has remained relatively steady since 1980, with declines in core metropolitan counties and growth in fringe metropolitan counties. The  household section includes information on numbers of households, marriages, divorces, live births, deaths, and causes of death. The employment section shows unemployment rates, average total employed in 1987, percentage of change, and several types of data on farming. Among other data the income section shows average weekly earnings; median household effective buying income; percent households below $10,000 income; state government revenues per capita; Ohio state rankings for tax collections; the federal, state, and local tax burden; revenue sources and expenditures; and taxable general tangible personal property. The miscellaneous section offers information on land use in Ohio since 1900, National Park and Forest Service areas, outdoor recreation facilities, physiographic regions, and  rural zoning.

        "description":"Considerable attention has been given to organizational effectiveness of public sector organizations at all levels: local, state, and federal. Public education has not escaped scrutiny. Current examinations of the effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of education are more intense than that of other public sector organizations. The organizational effectiveness of rural small school districts has been of particular interest. Rural schools have long been regarded as inferior to their counterparts in other settings, and in fact, rural districts have felt the pressures of new, potentially damaging demands on programs and services caused by declining enrollments, state reform initiatives, and depressed economic conditions. Although organizational effectiveness is a popular topic, no  meaningful definition of the topic, nor of effectiveness exists. The design of the organizational effectiveness study described in this paper is based on these points: (1) there cannot, at this time, be one universal model of organizational effectiveness because there is not a universal theory of organizations; and (2) it is more worthwhile to develop frameworks for assessing effectiveness than to try to develop theories. This design for assessing the organizational effectiveness of rural, small school districts consists of five major, mostly sequential, steps: (1) considering major policy and technical issues; (2) agreeing on how to think about the organization's various subsystems; (3) agreeing on what constitutes measures of quality; (4) agreeing on the translation of measures of  quality into standards; and (5) establishing the presence or absence of a standard.

Recent court decisions have brought about some equity in school financing, but the potential exists for future lawsuits for equity in educational facilities. There is a concern in the research literature for construction, maintenance, renovation, and similar capital outlay issues. Several studies conducted in Kansas suggest that state school districts are confronted with facility finance problems. The age and condition of facilities suggest continued and increasing maintenance and replacement costs. Kansas districts will continue to face obvious facility needs and inequalities. Conclusions of the study include:  (1) methods of funding capital outlay need to be changed; (2) neither rural nor urban school districts have a distinct advantage in facility funding; (3) there exists an inaccurate assumption that rural areas are wealthier than the urban areas; (4) rural and urban districts have different circumstances but similar problems; (5) the size of the capital outlay problem in Kansas is growing due to the age of the facilities and the deferral of maintenance and improvement; (6) tax rates, local economic health, and adequacy of the tax base determine the ability to bond for construction; (7) ability to finance facilities varies from district to district; (8) a majority of Kansas districts are unable to fund either the mean ability level or the mean expenditure level; and (9) the impact of  facilities on educational programs must be a central concern in the assessment of equity.

        "description":"Interest in general school finance reform escalated in the 1970s, with many court decisions ruling state educational finance systems unconstitutional because of extreme variations in local wealth. Many state systems of educational financing were realigned. While the remedies utilized generally served to placate reformers, a resurgence of challenges to finance schemes is becoming evident. The potential for lawsuits involving facility funding appears strong, with a growing concern that equality of opportunity may be affected by bricks and mortar. Research addressing the issues surrounding financing facilities in the state of Kansas examines the following: (1) determining the sources of concern and the associated legal issues; (2) assessing other states' handling of the issues; (3)  ascertaining the dimensions and effects of the problem in Kansas; (4) determining whether the problem is generic to the state or just a rural-urban difference; and (5) establishing whether or not there is a connection between educational facilities and the quality of educational programs. The following are conclusions and recommendations for the state of Kansas: (1) adopt a mechanism for granting true aid for facility construction and maintenance; (2) adopt an aid formula similar to those in other states; (3) allow for a high level of state participation; (4) consider current local effort; (5) provide for continual local incentive and local control; (6) provide funding for existing debt reduction; (7) prioritize the needs statewide; (8) identify cost projections; and (9) establish two  operational funds for assistance to local school districts, one for critical needs and one for long-range plans. The research suggests that there is a potential for state liability if court trends develop as indicated. Contains 30 references. (ALL)",

        "description":"This research project estimated migrant and seasonal agricultural workers in four Midwestern States in 1988, using the Public Health Service's definitions of such workers. Researchers collected federal agricultural data and state reports on migrant education programs and crop patterns, and considered other potential data sources. Numerous methodological difficulties led to the decision to consult a network of knowledgeable persons in each state. These people provided data on numbers of workers and dependents, counties involved, crops, length of season, peak times, worker origins, worker ethnicity, and proportion of workers traveling with families. Comparisons of data from all sources produced estimates indicating the number of migrant workers and dependents in each county during  a specified peak month. State totals of maximum estimated peak numbers of migrants and dependents are: workers 925, dependents 815 for Iowa; workers 2,890, dependents 3,070 for Kansas; workers 910, dependents 555 for Missouri; and workers 3,250, dependents 1,310 for Nebraska. Most migrants were Hispanics with a home base in Texas. Estimates for seasonal workers were based primarily on the 1978 and 1982 Censuses of Agriculture, and are believed to be similar to 1988 figures. Estimated totals of seasonal workers and estimated maximum number of dependents for each state in 1982 are, respectively, 14,805 and 21,275 for Iowa; 5,949 and 8,549 for Kansas; 8,637 and 12,411 for Missouri; and 6,701 and 9,629 for Nebraska. The size of the migrant and seasonal workforce is expected to remain stable  for the next 5-10 years. This report contains 14 tables and maps, lists of data sources and contacts, a set of official definitions, and the survey questionnaire. (SV)",

With this in mind, three rural school systems in north Louisiana collaborated with the Louisiana Center for Rural or Small Schools (LaCROSS) to develop teacher recruitment materials. LaCROSS researchers interviewed school administrators, teachers, and local officials to determine the elements in each parish and its schools that might attract prospective teachers. Recruitment materials were then tailored to local market forces. For Jackson Parish, packets, videos, and slides emphasized a high teacher pay supplement, proximity to urban centers and area universities, availability of housing and recreational  activities, and an industrial tax base. For Franklin Parish, packets, videos, and slides emphasized a developing urban hub and industrial base, advantages of small rural schools, and availability of recreational activities and a university branch campus. For very rural Tensas Parish, a brochure emphasized advantages of small rural schools and opportunities for certification, entry level teaching, and teaching &quot;back home.&quot; An appendix contains samples of these recruitment materials.

        "description":"A report of the Governor's Interim Commission on Children and Youth, released in January, 1988, presented evidence that Alaska needs to formulate a comprehensive strategy to develop a strong foundation upon which Alaska's children can build productive and satisfying lives. A groundswell of support is building toward the belief that Alaska needs to take careful action that will significantly alter the way society provides for the care and education of its young children. This paper describes a broad framework upon which a strategy to address early childhood and parenting could be built. Programs for young children need to be based on how young children learn and grow, and they need to have strong components for parent and family involvement. The responsibility of the Alaska  Department of Education in such a comprehensive statewide early childhood strategy should be to: (1) provide school personnel with a thorough understanding of the theoretical and practical aspects of teaching young children and supporting their needs and strengths; and (2) help educators understand how to build effective partnerships between schools and families. The aim of these two efforts is to improve school climate and to strengthen the base of support for Alaska's families. Current efforts of the Department of Education are outlined as they relate to early childhood development and parenting. Emphasis is placed on developing a partnership of parents, parent groups, politicians, public and private agencies, and public and private schools, as well as a myriad of other organizations.  Also included is a description of what the Alaska Parenting Model should be, together with a philosophy and a list of objectives. (ALL)",

        "author":["Monk, David H."],
        "description":"This review explores the debate on optimal school size and discusses policy options available to states for expanding curricular offerings in small rural schools. Policy options are divided into three broad categories: traditional, modified traditional, and nontraditional. The report explores the possibilities available under each approach, documents instances where various policies have been pursued, and offers speculation regarding largely untried alternatives. The traditional approach reflects the belief that low enrollment levels contribute to inadequate program offerings. Policies falling under this rubric include mandates for small districts to consolidate into larger ones. The modified traditional approach is similar except that it is more tolerant of locally developed  means of raising enrollment levels. The nontraditional approach differs substantially from the other two because it places less emphasis on low enrollment as the primary source of difficulty for small rural schools. Instead, problems are viewed as having more to do with the utilization of available technology, the quality and nature of teacher resources, low fiscal capacity, and nonsize-related features of ruralness (such as isolation). The goal of the nontraditional approach is to address more directly the perceived causes of difficulty rather than to increase school sizes. It calls for further development of instructional technologies, more creative uses of itinerant services, alternative scheduling (such as the four-day week), and programs designed to enhance diversity. The document  takes the position that each of the three policies holds promise, and pays particular attentions to the possibilities associated with residential schools (the traditional approach), locally designed reorganizations (the modified traditional approach), and the use of instructional technologies (the nontraditional approach).

        "description":"This paper examines trends that are currently reshaping rural America and rural education. It reviews the debate about how best to improve rural school districts, suggesting that what is needed is a better understanding of the changing context in which this country's public school enterprise is taking place. The paper begins by reviewing the work on several recent typologies of nonmetropolitan America which establish the nature of diversity there. This is followed by consideration of the equally important concept that rural schools differ among themselves, as indicated by early results of promising research. In the third section, a synthesis is provided of the major economic, social and political developments impacting rural America that appear to have the most significance for  school improvement programs. Next, the paper provides a synthesis of the &quot;first round&quot; of education reform and a review of what is being suggested as the most meaningful direction for the next generation of reform. The emphasis in both instances, however, is on the seldom considered consequences of reform on small, rural school districts; these educational developments represent potentially significant changes in the environment in which rural systems function. The paper concludes with a discussion of potential policy implications of the economic, social, political, and educational trends for rural school improvement efforts. The focus here is on displaying the major dimensions of the changing context in which rural school improvement must take place. It is suggested that long-term rural  school improvement should be specific to each state in recognition of the existing policies, traditions, and diversity of state systems.

SSA's overall employment of Hispanics in 1987 was 6.4%, equal to the national rate of availability of Hispanics in the civilian labor force (CLF). However, SSA's rate of employment of Hispanic men was less than half their CLF availability rate, while the rate of female Hispanic employment was almost double the CLF availability rate. Underrepresentation of Hispanic men occurred in 7 of 10 regional offices and was particularly evident in the Atlanta (Region IV) office. Nearly 70% of Hispanics at SSA were employed in three civil service job series,  in administrative, technical, and clerical positions providing information to the public and processing benefit claims. In 1988, about 8.2% of all SSA field office employees were certified by SSA, through interview, as Spanish-speaking. An internal memorandum indicated that SSA offices in five cities were having difficulties in hiring bilingual administrative employees and were recruiting at local colleges. Most SSA public information is printed in Spanish and English. Benefit recipients with annotated records receive notices of benefit actions and certain follow-up materials in Spanish. SSA conducts quality-of-service surveys but does not identify racial or ethnic groups therein. This report contains 11 tables and graphs. (SV)",

        "description":"This analysis of employment patterns in the American South extends a 1985 report, &quot;After the Factories: Changing Employment Patterns in the Rural South,&quot; which was based on the years between 1977-1982. The 1985 report included Texas, but this analysis includes only the 12 Southern Growth Policies Board (SGPB) member states. This new analysis extends well into the expansion phase of the post-recessionary period and adds per capita income growth and unemployment rates as rough indicators of the quality of growth. Civilian government and corporate support employment have been added to total employment figures to provide a more comprehensive employment measure. The study also looks more closely at the manufacturing and service sectors, and provides a more reliable estimate of the  growth of high technology industries. Also considered are local factors suspected of influencing economic growth, particularly those reflecting human resources, including adult literacy, university enrollment, and scientists and technicians, as well as access to interstate highways and the presence of commercial airports. This report finds that employment grew considerably faster in metro counties than in nonmetro counties during the period, but that the average employment growth in nonmetro counties was nearly double the national average. Service and construction industries were behind most new jobs and many of the rural counties experiencing the highest growth rates in manufacturing were geographically remote. After taking inflation into account, however, real per capita income declined  in most nonmetro counties. Measures of education and human resources were the most consistent and strongest predictors of growth. The fastest-growing counties generally appear to be located in areas likely to attract tourists or retirees. But the most dramatic success stories resulted from a range of strategies based on local efforts responding to local circumstances and problems. Data is displayed in numerous tables and figures, and appendixes include an outline of industry clasifications, profiles of all 12 SGPB states, various statistical breakdowns on distribution of employment, a list of the top 100 high tech industries, and information on the Enhanced County Business Patterns file.

The result may be measured in loss of employment and income. This report provides a method to estimate such economic impacts with a minimum of data collection and manipulation. Most of the input data required are available from the Census of Agriculture and the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The model takes the practitioner's estimates of changes in agricultural production and estimates the change in agricultural sales. Then, the predicted change in total sales generates estimates of changes in total county employment and county income. This much is possible by simply estimating changes in production of key crops. Inclusion of estimated  changes for other basic sectors can produce even more meaningful estimates. The model's shortcomings are its dependence on cross-sectional data, and the fact that reliability is threatened if agricultural commodity price levels change significantly or if the county under investigation deviates greatly in crops, livestock, employment, or population size from the 48 Texas counties used as a proxy for Southern rural areas in the model's development. This report contains 11 references, statistical equations, the computer report format, instructions for using the interactive computer program, and an example of model application.

Although the literature documents the process of the investigative approach, greater utilization of available programs and support from teachers are not evidenced. This investigation was devised to determine teacher perceptions and their relationships to this concern. These questions were addressed: (1) &quot;To what extent are teacher variables, such as grade level, years of experience, and frequency of scheduling science time, related to teacher evaluation of the SCIS-II program?&quot; (2) &quot;How do teachers perceive the barriers and support systems that exist in their district's elementary science program?&quot; (3) &quot;What student  outcomes do teachers see as significant results of the SCIS-II program?

Are they consistent with the body of research? and (4) &quot;What specific concepts, materials, activities, etc., do teachers find to be problems in the present program, and what changes do they feel might alleviate the problems?&quot; It was concluded that teachers in grades 3-6 perceived more barriers to effective instruction and experienced greater problems with management, materials, and equipment during activities than their colleagues in the lower grades.

        "description":"Many teachers work in the difficult situation of teaching academic subjects to students who are not academically oriented. Especially in high school, non-college-bound students are required to take two or three years of science and social studies. For these students schools offer lower-track classes that exhibit high failure rates and low teacher and student motivation. This study attempts to increase understanding of this situation and knowledge of what approaches work in motivating these students. The study focuses on the curricular goals that seem to guide effective teachers of non-college-bound students and what place extrinsic and intrinsic motivation had in such teachers' motivating strategies. In general, the results show that teachers de-emphasized subject matter  knowledge goals with non-college-bound students while more openly advocating functional skill goals. For intrinsic motivation, teachers worked on increasing students' feelings of efficacy in the classroom. Developing student interest in the subject was a strategy used to nurture intrinsic motivation. This paper includes an abstract, introduction, research methods, results, summary and findings, implications, and references. (RT)",

The authoring system utilized word processors to write the lessons and a BASIC computer program to execute the word processor files. Interactive lessons written on a word processor using one operating system were transferred to a different operating system using communications software. To maintain computer compatibility, worksheets were used to present graphics material. Students and remote teachers communicated through electronic mail (e-mail). The lessons saved student responses to questions in a form which was easily included in e-mail  messages. The remote teacher wrote answers to the questions in a form which was returned to the student on e-mail. These answers were executable as lessons and merged into existing lessons using word processing functions. This created a dynamic software library which was updated as student questions were answered. This report includes the cost of continuing the course and the student evaluation of the course.

        "description":"In most research that investigates factors influencing the success of analogies in instruction, an underlying assumption is that students have little or no knowledge of the target situation. It is interesting to ask what factors influence the success of analogies when students believe they understand the target situation. If this understanding is not normative, instruction must aim at conceptual change rather than simply conceptual growth. Through the analysis of four case studies of tutoring interviews, a preliminary list of factors important for success in overcoming misconceptions via analogical reasoning is proposed. First, there must be a usable anchoring conception. Second, the analogical connection between an anchoring example and the target situation may need to be  developed explicitly through processes such as the use of intermediate analogies. Third, it may be necessary to engage the student in a process of analogical reasoning in an interactive teaching environment, rather than simply presenting the analogy in a text or lecture. Finally, the result of this process may need to be the student's construction of a new explanatory model of the target situation. (YP)",

These are some of the answers most elementary school students tell you when they are asked about science class. It has been substantiated by decades of research that experiential experiences are exciting and remembered, visual and kinesthetic-tactile approaches are effective student motivators, and students with reading difficulties can succeed with such activities. This paper describes an activity in which students build a chemistry set that is used in subsequent activities. Materials used for the set are available in the home, school, and community. Listed are: (1) materials needed; (2) procedures for jar labeling, storage cabinet and tray construction, filling  chemical storage jars, and equipment and chemical storage; and (3) curriculum extension activities which include report and letter writing, pretending to run a business selling chemistry sets, and several activities that involve using the chemicals in the set.

        "description":"In this report, the mathematics and science proficiency of students in third, seventh, and eleventh grades in Catholic schools was compared to the national average of the 1985-86 National Assessment of Mathematics and Science. The introduction describes the differences in reading/writing and mathematics/science that the National Assessment of Educational Progress reports and the background characteristics of Catholic and public schools. Included in the second chapter are the proficienies related to: (1) demographic characteristics and family background; (2) school characteristics; (3) student behavior; (4) course work in computer, mathematics and science by eleventh-graders; and (5) social differences in course work. This paper concludes that Catholic school mathematics and  science proficiency levels at grades three, seven, and eleven are above those of public school students. The differences between students in Catholic and public schools which relate to the association between family background and course-taking, and academic proficiency are summarized. Five levels of mathematics and science proficiency are appended. (YP)",

The results of the diagnostic test indicate that a number of group anchors exist, such as the belief that a spring pushes up on a hand compressing it. Second, unexpected non-anchors, for example, the belief that a stationary railroad box car does not exert a force on a man travelling on the front of a second box car which runs into the stationary car, are discussed. Third, evidence was found that some anchoring examples were\"brittle,\" that is, evidence that the anchor could not be extended analogically to help a student make sense of a target situation. It was suggested that further research is needed to construct a theory of anchoring conceptions that would specify what characteristics would indicate that an anchoring conception can provide the basis for conceptual change through analogical extension. The diagnostic test items and the anchor diagnostic results are provided. (YP)",

Conclusions based on the results of the survey were: (1) the teachers averaged seven years computer experience but the quality was questionable; (2) the number of computer systems available was insufficient to support use and restricted the  teachers' selection of applications for physics instruction; (3) the teachers wanted to use all of the computer applications more frequently; and (4) the enabling factors were quantity of computer systems, software, and preparation time and the constraining factors were lack of funds for purchasing, having time to prepare for use, and having computer systems available.

Three programs comprised MIC: the Elementary Program, the Middle School Program, and the Middle School Pilot Program. In the first two (nonpilot) programs, selected pupils were served in computer-assisted instruction (CAI) labs. The MIC-Pilot program teachers used a variety of instructional methods. The MIC-CAI programs served 883 pupils in grades two through six for an average of 3.6 hours of instruction per week. Analysis of the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills (CTBS) Total Mathematics scores indicated an average growth of 16.0 normal curve equivalent (NCE) points for the 6.2  month instructional period. The amount of NCE change varied inversely with grade level. The MIC-Pilot program served 210 pupils in grades six and seven for an average of 1.8 hours of instruction per week. Analysis of the CTBS Total Mathematics scores indicated an average growth of 14.6 NCE points for the same period. Three inservice meetings were rated highly by program teachers. Three recommendations were suggested for each program. Tables and instruments are provided in the appendices. (YP)",

        "description":"Many believe that whether teachers teach students to \"do\" science, teach about science, or teach about technology instead, science teachers should be as culturally literate about science as possible. Also, it is believed that a philosophy of science course which uses history of science, some normative epistemologies, practical examples, and current post-modernist views could promote that cultural literacy. The purpose of this study is to explore the need for a historically vibrant philosophy of science course; evaluate the current status of such programs; and offer an initial framework to science teacher educators for a course in philosophy of science. As a result of a literature search, a 17-institution survey, and a methods texts evaluation, important questions in philosophy of  science have emerged which need to be included in science teacher education programs. The final contribution in this study is a framework which begins to address specific important issues such as the nature of theories, the quality of explanations, and how various confirmatory techniques differ. The paper describes purpose, methods, results, and methods text evaluation, as well as a model or framework for philosophically valid questions about science. Appendices include a questionnaire, a list of institutions surveyed, the text of the qualitative evaluation, and 44 references. (RT)",

In 1987 a longitudinal teacher research partners study was begun by the Middle and Junior High Division of NSTA and The University of Iowa. The second year of the study was funded by California State University, San Bernardino. This study examines characteristics of key teachers in exemplary middle/junior high science programs and student learning outcomes. The results have shown that in exemplary middle/junior high science programs: (1) teachers are highly professional; (2) students can learn both high levels of science knowledge and positive attitudes  toward science; (3) students score higher on some items and lower on some items on the applications and connections questionnaire than those in the national sample; and (4) gender differences in science learning begin to appear. Following an abstract and introduction, the paper outlines the purpose of the study, describes the design, procedures, and results, and provides conclusions and recommendations. Also included are tables showing variables evaluated in the study, teacher classroom instructional practice characteristics, techniques used, ability composition of classes, student perceptions about science classes, and applications and connections responses.

The inquiry approach used in the Foundational Approaches in Science Teaching (FAST) program and a traditional science textbook approach were compared in terms of the three major evaluative points mentioned above. During the 1987-88 school year, the FAST 1 program was integrated into a regular science curriculum in the FAST group as a treatment at both sixth and seventh grades, while traditional textbook approaches were predominant in the non-FAST group for each grade level. At the end of the school year, post-tests were administered to both FAST and non-FAST groups. Results indicated that laboratory skills,  science process skills, and science achievement as a whole ability were affected by the FAST 1 instruction at each grade level.

The program consisted of four phases: (1) &quot;Establishment&quot; (emphasizing trust between teachers and consultants); (2) &quot;Directed Training for Reflection and Action Research&quot; (developing techniques for increasing teachers' project comprehension;) (3) &quot;More Autonomous Teacher-Initiated Collaborative Action Research&quot; (listing all the factors that might influence students' attitudes and application in years 7-11, and forming working groups to deal with different factors); and (4) &quot;New Partners--Students Joining Consultants and Teachers as Researchers.&quot; A major insight is  that the relative importance of factors changes with time, individuals and context. Other insights include the diversity of students' reactions to lessons and the fact that teachers' impressions of the reactions are often misleading. The shift in responsibility from consultants to teachers and students is described. Questions from the &quot;What I Think of Science&quot; instrument and &quot;Year 9 Agreement on Science Teaching and Learning Weekly Evaluation Form&quot; are provided in the appendices. (YP)",

        "description":"The desire to abolish the gap between research theory and classroom practice has sparked an increasing interest in field-based research among science educators. Although most researchers are aware of the standard meanings of informed consent and confidentiality, and there are some codes of ethical principles published by such groups as the American Psychological Association, these codes provide little help with the problems that may arise in field work. Traditional approaches to ethics in research, focusing on the rights of subjects versus the benefits of the research, were written to serve traditional research methods and are inadequate for addressing the dilemmas of field-based research. This paper discusses the relationship between ethics and methodology, commonly used  procedures and contractual obligations of social scientists. An approach to ethics that focuses on particular human relationships rather than general principles is suggested. Stressed is the notion that researchers should consider their commitment to the support of science educators and learners when making decisions concerning what to research. (CW)",

From 1986 to 1988 the project was implemented in the large urban Baltimore school system with 100 teachers who ranged in computer literacy from novice to experienced user. Components of the inservice design included teacher training, acquisition of hardware and software, development of model lessons, and the establishment of an extensive and diverse support system. The nature and extent of implementation of that training is currently being evaluated. Project staff are closely monitoring both personal and classroom use of the computer by  those trained. Preliminary results indicate that 90% of trained teachers are using computers to manage instruction, and 75% are using computers in their science classrooms. Included are the classroom observation form and the computer usage questionnaire. (Author/MVL)",

These two aspects of math ability respond differently to environmental resources, with math concepts much more responsive to family factors before formal schooling begins than is computation. In this sample blacks and whites are equivalent in terms of computational and verbal skills as measured by the California Achievement Test (CAT) at the start of grade one. However, black boys equal white boys and white girls in terms of math concepts (reasoning skills) but black girls are about one quarter of a standard deviation lower than others in terms of math concepts on the CAT. Both black and white  children of all socioeconomic levels respond to parents' psychological resources: net of ability or other factors, children score higher if parents expect them to do well. Socioeconomic resources in the home also help both groups. In particular, the parent's being a high school graduate as opposed to a drop-out is important. When parents' material and psychological resources are taken into account, family configuration (solo motherhood vs. other types) has no discernible effects on either type of math performance. There are 48 references listed. (Author/DC)",

        "description":"This paper explores some possible productive links between ecology and education, with particular reference to the ethical position described by the term \"deep ecology\" and to empirical research in perceptual psychology that has led to the formation of ecological theories of perception. It is suggested that these ecological understandings support an enduring philosophy of education that is usually traced back to Aristotle and that has flowered most recently in the essays of the late Joseph Schwab and those of his intellectual heirs who practice what has become known as deliberative curriculum theorizing. From this analysis it is argued that designing a curriculum in which the learner is characterized as becoming ecopolitical is an intellectually and morally defensible ideal. In  the course of developing the analyses and arguments outlined above, some criticisms of the rhetoric of postmodern and new paradigm thinking are offered. Particular reference is made to temporal perspectives which suggest that it may sometimes be more appropriate to represent paradigms as myths and to speak of renewed rather than new paradigms.

K-2 students learn about the census and participate in a simulation of the census process. In grades 2-6, students learn the concepts of complete count and undercount, prepare maps, summarize data, and make decisions. In grades 4-7, students learn census terminology and and census history. Students in grades 3-10 participate in and conduct a home and hobby survey. Students in grades 4-8 gain hands-on experience using census-like data to decide about community services  and businesses. Changes in population size and distribution are considered in the plan for grades 5-12. In grades 6-12, students examine recent census area and population data to identify extreme cases and study changes over time. Three lessons are included for grades 7-12. Students study the process of designing, conducting, and analyzing survey results; study census data and discuss population diversity, business and community planning, and the housing industry; and examine historical census data and primary sources to gain insight into changing data needs and a sense of the historic nature of the census in this country.

It offers an introduction to the topics of the Jewish-Christian encounter, Israel, anti-Semitism, Christian Scriptures, the works of Elie Wiesel, and available educational resources, all in light of the Jewish-Christian dialogue in institutions of higher learning. Carl Evans presents a syllabus for a course in which students are required to converse with local clergy in order to explain the Jewish-Christian dialogue at the grass-roots level. This technique helps students develop mature ways of thinking on a personal, social, and religious level. Robert Everett and Bruce Bramlett  discuss Israel's problematic existence, raising numerous points that can lead to effective classroom discussions. Alan Davies describes his course on anti-Semitism and presents several practical suggestions and instrumental techniques. John Roth offers a short biography of Elie Wiesel's life, his writings, and his paradoxes. Norman Beck provides a model of how a Christian teaches the Christian Scriptures, offering guidelines that are highly supportive of and sympathetic to the Jewish-Christian dialogue. Michael Shermis the &quot;Guest Editor&quot; presents an annotated list of 71 educational resources, including books, media, and educational programs, to be utilized by those involved in both the academic and the lay Jewish-Christian dialogue. Twenty-two book reviews are included in this issue, as  are 21 book notes on a variety of topics. (GEA)",

The Soviet history profession itself is also undergoing a major self-examination, as reformist elements battle Stalinist elements. Premier Gorbachev has called for new, more honest studies of the Soviet national past, especially of the several &quot;blank spots&quot; that exist in Stalinist history. Textbooks are the principal means for perpetuating an approved history. In the USSR, school history textbooks are written to conform to the history syllabus designed by the State Committee for Public Education. Gorbachev and his fellow  reformers need a new national history, but not one that criticizes the role of the Party or undermines their own authority. It remains to be seen if the critical ferment within the history profession can be controlled by the State, and what new version of Soviet history will be produced. (PPB)",

        "description":"While the continuing wage gap between men and women, Whites and non-Whites has been well documented, the purpose of this study was to examine the role which discrimination on the basis of race/ethnicity as well as sex plays in the setting of wages. Whether pay equity is an effective means of remedying race-based wage discrimination was also explored. A study by the Memphis State University (Tennessee) Center for Research on Women indicates that non-Whites were under-compensated for the work they performed. This wage dissimilarity was also reflected in an occupational dissimilarity between sexes and races. Occupations were examined according to the concentrations of specific groups within them, and average earnings by the percentage of specific groups in that occupation. The  impact of education and experience on the hypothetical implementation of pay equity was reviewed. Pay equity for Blacks and Hispanics in New York State government employment was looked at by the Center for Women in Government, Rockefeller College, State University of New York, and revealed that job titles held by Black and Hispanic women were the most undervalued. A study by the University of Washington (Seattle) showed that regardless of the statistical mode used females and Black males were paid less for similar jobs even when other factors were taken into account. This study illustrated that while pay equity was a solution to race and sex based discrimination, the finding that wage differentials were tied to the job category pointed to a different set of issues: those of job  segregation. The Service Employees International Union (SEIU), AFL-CIO, investigated race and sex discrimination in Los Angeles County employment policies and documented patterns of segregation on the basis of race and sex which perpetuate wage discrimination. The document contains 34 tables, 8 figures, and 9 appendixes providing data which support the findings of the National Committee on Pay Equity and the three case studies. References are also given.

        "description":"Past research on political socialization has failed to provide clear implications for educational policy or practice. However, reconceptualizing that research using a framework derived from cognitive psychology can reveal relationships between political socialization and education not previously seen. In this reconceptualization, schema or conceptual networks are the primary vehicles for remembering and retrieving information and using that information to solve problems. Such an analysis of previous research reveals four points. One, the typical school curriculum presents information in a way which does not allow the student to relate it to existing schemata and, when appropriate, to restructure them. Two, there are some general cognitive characteristics which need to be taken  into account in curricular formulations. These include adolescent difficulties in decentering, perceiving reciprocity, and coordinating different parts of their personal schemata. Three, an active student involvement with controversial issues combined requires them to defend various positions stimulates students' restructuring of schemata and positively contributes to civic education. Four, the conceptualization of social or political schema, when linked with recent work on reading, suggests the possibility of dealing explicitly with students' concept maps as part of instructional methods. Asking students to construct and discuss concept maps or diagrams of political actors and actions may be a useful tool for increasing the complexity of their schemata. If current research on political  socialization in young people focused on schemata and conceptual networks, it would be more useful in improving citizenship education than it has been. (PPB)",

        "author":["Leming, James S."],
        "description":"The basic paradox of citizenship education in the United States is that the first steps toward the rational, autonomous, critical-minded citizen required by a democracy are necessarily non-rational and based on an unquestioned deference to authority. The movement from the morality of authority to the morality of principle constitutes the challenge of citizenship education. It is in the period of adolescence that there exists a critical opportunity for the bridging of these two moralities. At some point in the maturation process of the individual, obedience to parent/teacher authority is tempered by the influence of a variety of social groups, and eventually the individual develops a sense of autonomy and allegiance to self-chosen principles. Citizenship education must not teach  phoney concepts, or inadequately explain the meanings of terms such as rights. It should not be assumed that the value content of the curriculum is necessarily the value content learned by the students. It is also important to realize that by asking students to critically question society's realization of democratic values before they have internalized solid foundations for those values, they may cast those values aside when they find they are unable to resolve ambiguous or controversial value problems. A set of core values that are developmentally appropriate and lend themselves to application in concrete situations should rest at the heart of the civics curriculum. This curriculum should demand a high degree of student involvement, with personal significance to the students. It is  extremely important to realize that at the level of the early adolescent, the goal of citizenship education is to assist in that long journey towards citizenship, not to immediately fabricate model citizens. Twenty-two references are included. (PPB)",

The development of civic competency in student-citizens requires not only an abstract comprehension of political systems, but also the generation of applied political and media skills. One major emphasis of citizenship education concerns the interdependence of peoples and political entities throughout the world. Television in particular brings the concept of a global village into the classroom and should be used to heighten students'  interest in and awareness of civic education. Other major themes of civic education concern the use of the news media as an instructional tool for political systems education, the ubiquitous nature of politics in public affairs reporting, and the importance of teaching competency in coping with bureaucratic systems.

        "description":"The future of civic education in the United States must be examined within the changing social context of the structure of U.S. society and the directions toward which that society is moving. The underlying, shared dimensions of the theoretical analysis of society must be examined to understand that context and discover those directions of change. The institutional elements of the social infrastructure which are examined include education, economy, and demography. The implications of certain social processes such as community, ethnicity, and social deviance, specifically drugs, and value systems, such as individualism, are also analyzed. Economic and demographic shifts reinforce the need for global awareness. Cultural differences become more, not less, apparent in a shrinking  world, engendering a need for cultural pluralism. Civic education of the 21st century should instill a knowledge and an acceptance of those cultural variations. It should also help to rebuild the lost sense of community by developing opportunities to experience social involvement and community participation. The establishment of a sociological context for the future of civic education shows that: (1) sociological concepts can serve as interpretive guideposts in understanding the social world; (2) if these sociological concepts are to be understood and incorporated into civic education, teachers must be well versed in their meaning; and (3) when the sociological perspective makes private issues (such as drug abuse and divorce) public, the student learns that these difficulties need not be  faced alone.

Developments in artificial intelligence, however, have provided new and better tools for exploring human knowledge acquisition and utilization. Expert system technology represents one of the most promising of these developments. Expert systems are computer programs that store human-like knowledge. Methods of expert system design are discussed, as are ways of computing propositional and predicate logic. &quot;Harmony Coach&quot; (written in Turbo Prolog) is an intelligent tutoring system that uses the microcomputer environment (IBM PC, XT, AT) to coach the specific musical tasks of writing tonal harmonic progressions, aiding the student in the creation of an  acceptable harmonic sequence based on either an unfigured bass line or on a melody. It also coaches students in part-writing any previously harmonized exercises using the traditional four-part chorale model. The &quot;Coach&quot; is designed around the following premises, most of which are essential to any intelligent tutoring system: it must be based on sound musical precepts; it should operate in a passive role; hardware aspects should be transparent to the end user; it should use artificial intelligence whenever possible; it should embrace knowledge, explanative understanding, and problem-solving abilities; and it must run under normal restrictions of a high-end microcomputer learning environment. These precepts are explored in detail. Strengths and weaknesses of the program are discussed and a  7-item bibliography is included. (GEA)",

In Freire's theories of liberatory education, education should open minds to higher stages of consciousness rather than just deposit information for future use, for knowledge emerges only through invention and inquiry. While one of the criticisms of Freire is that his methods are too abstract, it must be realized that his pedagogy is designed on very basic assumptions and political realities. People read and write what they understand and what is relevant to their lives. By learning new words and new social-political realities, consciousness and literacy are both increased. Participatory methods and the encouragement of critical  thinking results in a rigorous, but not rigid, pedagogy that is democratic in approach. Educational problems such as the gifted underachiever or teacher burnout can be effectively addressed through Freire's work. Six references are included. (PPB)",

Writing helps students organize their thoughts on topics and involves them more deeply in the subject matter as they search for the answers to assigned log entries. The goal of the logs is to encourage expressive writing because it closely approximates the thought process. The mechanics of using logs in class are explored, including uniformity, grading criteria, and format. Student logs also benefit the instructor, as they provide timely feedback on  the success of lectures and highlight problems encountered by students while working on projects.

        "description":"Informed observers, from the political right to the left, believe that citizen education requires reform. While its effects on public life may be unclear, democratic theory insists that education is required as a condition of democracy itself. Most often, students are given information about the founding of the government, its structure, and due process of law. Reformers advocate instruction concentrated on moral reasoning, public controversy, global interdependence, and cultural pluralism. Student participation in community service, political action, and school governance have also been proposed. Both mainstream and reform programs have failed because (1) citizen education receives low priority, (2) the curriculum offers inadequate attention to issues central to democratic  citizenship, and (3) reform plans have not included teachers in the planning process. This analysis addresses the central issues neglected in both traditional and reform programs. Three orientations of citizenship education are discussed: cultural induction, emancipation, and the hidden curriculum of cynical realism. Thoughtful citizens need help dealing with the following issues: pluralism, distributive justice, individual interests and collective responsibility, and meaningful participation. Direct experience is necessary to motivate students and maximize retention and transfer, and participation is also a valuable source of citizenship knowledge. Reform initiatives should include teachers and must address those fundamental issues of modern U.S. citizenship that are neglected in  educational programs. Education must rely on direct student experience and concentrate on issues such as pluralism, distributive justice, and meaningful participation. (GEA)",

        "description":"Due to the injection of carbon dioxide and various other gasses into the atmosphere, the world of the 21st century may well have a climate that is beyond the parameters of human existence. Physical science produces information regarding the physical effects of increasing concentrations of &quot;greenhouse&quot; gasses. Once this information is developed, it is transferred to social scientists who evaluate the effects of physical changes on individual and social behavior, and economic and political systems. Information from both physical and social scientists is then transferred to policymakers and their advisors. This picture of the relationship between science and policy consorts with what may be regarded as a &quot;positivist&quot; view of science and value--a view deeply entrenched in U.S.  science and public life. An analysis of the use of such a model reveals several problems, showing that it provides a distorted picture of the situation. Some salient considerations should be taken into account when developing policy related to the greenhouse effect. There will continue to be substantial increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide. This will lead to climate change and will have a biological and ecological impact. The possible political and economic effects of climactic change must also be considered. Policymakers must realize that the usual techniques of policy analysis are not adequate to managing a problem of this magnitude. By focusing on the possibilities of producing positive incremental changes, incorporating global concerns in national environmental impact policies, and  accelerating scientific research into this complex problem, the nation may begin to solve this global dilemma. A 27-item bibliography is included. (GEA)",

They range from very simple assignments that should take only a few minutes of the student's time, to projects that might require several days or an extended period of time. In terms of difficulty, they range from very easy descriptive types of assignments to those that call for careful thought, research, and analysis. Teachers can select those activities that are suitable for a particular class, group, or individual. Although originally written for use with a particular textbook, these assignments should be applicable to any standard high school economics text or to some of the  simpler college texts frequently used in secondary schools. An index is included to help teachers find assignments relevant to their own textbooks. In addition, each major concept, topic, problem, or principle is underlined throughout the document. Most of the suggested assignments have been used by high school economics teachers. An index of economic concepts and topics concludes the document. (GEA)",

        "author":["Ediger, Marlow"],
        "description":"Four philosophies of computer use in the social studies field are discussed, each representing a unique school of thought in teaching and learning. They are idealism, realism, experimentation, and existentialism. Idealists believe in an idea-centered social studies curriculum. Tutorial programs, carefully selected to achieve relevant goals, may well present subject matter to students in a logical sequence. Realism stresses that one can know the real world as it truly is. Teachers adhering to realism as an educational philosophy select learning opportunities for students to attain precise objectives. After completing the software program, teachers measure if students have/have not been successful in goal attainment. Experimentalism stresses a problem-solving procedure, for which a  flexible model is presented. Software must assist students to secure knowledge directly related to the problem, which should be life-like and real. Existentialist social studies teachers advocate students learning to choose and make decisions. A learning center approach, in which students select desired tasks and software programs, while omitting those not having a perceived purpose, might well emphasize existentialist tenets. The student is responsible for his/her choices. A second plan involves student-teacher planning of objectives, learning opportunities, and appraisal procedures. Students might choose which software packages to use in a given unit. Under any philosophy, software should be instrumental to problem solving in the social studies. Criteria for software selection are  presented, as is a 7-item bibliography. (GEA)",

        "description":"This document describes Indiana's experience with the National History Day program, explores the potential for historical agency involvement, and presents partial results of a survey conducted of History Day coordinators in the state. Indiana History Day was established at the Social Studies Development Center and Indiana University (Bloomington) and picked up by the Indiana Historical Bureau when initial funding ran out in 1980. There are now fruitful collaborations between academic affiliates and historical agencies in both strong and weak programs throughout the country. For a strong organization, there should be a strong cooperative relationship between the state coordinator and the major social studies and history organization or organizations at the state level. Impediments  to such collaborations are examined and successful programs are identified. A survey was distributed by the Indiana Historical Bureau and included questions from various state coordinators that had been submitted after the June 1988 national contest. Responses provided a general picture of low funding, few personnel and little staff support, little recognition, and a lack of knowledge among state coordinators about their district level programs. Most states have a long way to go to fulfill the potential that History Day offers for history instruction at all levels. National History Day is one of the best scholastic competitions available, but it must be institutionalized with mechanisms for solid, stable funding and support services to make it the best possible program serving the largest  possible number of students and teachers.

Available ERIC resources about National History Day are listed and a five-point plan to establish a school History Day is provided. Successful approaches to implementing History Day, from actual teachers' experiences, are detailed. A step-by-step approach to help students organize and complete their projects is presented. Eighteen handouts which help the process are included. &quot;How to Start History Day in the Classroom&quot; is the topic of an essay that suggests ways to motivate students and stimulate their interest in some topic. Evaluation forms and student worksheets complement this essay. Another essay describes ways to help students prepare successful History Day entries.  Support and encouragement are crucial in the development of the project, at the competition, and after--regardless of the outcome. A guide for reading historical documents is presented to help students in the learning and research process. Two elementary teachers describe how they use Ada Millington's diary in the classroom. The diary depicts the life of a 12-year-old girl traveling across the country in the 1860s. Suggestions for developing historical papers for the History Day competition are outlined. Other sections describe how to create successful media and performance presentations. Four activities help students develop performances and a 15-item bibliography on drama in education is included. Finally, the &quot;hows&quot; and &quot;whys&quot; of a successful History Day project are summarized. The  guide is illustrated with numerous black and white photographs. (GEA)",

        "description":"Legal implications of oral history research and collection can be divided into four broad areas of concern, including copyright, restriction of access, libel, and contracts. This document presents highlights from various authorities in each of these areas. Peterson notes that interviewers and interviewees hold the copyright to their own words; a single oral history embodies two copyrights. Archives should seek transfer of copyright to themselves so they are able to bring suit for infringement if another individual or institution uses the words of the interview. Pierce states that the interviewer and narrator should both sign legal releases for interview content and residual property rights. Four areas of archival material may require access restrictions: privacy concerns and  business, personal and investigative information. Four basic privacy invasions are identified, noting that privacy is a right of living individuals only. Libel is the written defamation of a person's character or reputation. Since oral histories are taped and/or transcribed, defamation contained therein would be libel. Duckett contends that a curator, the institution, the interviewer, and the narrator can all be held liable for damages in a libel suit. Oral history materials can be covered to a great extent by the same type of contracts which are associated with archival and manuscript material. Unique considerations concerning oral history contracts are discussed. Librarians with oral history collections should make use of competent legal advice. A 9-item bibliography of the cited  authorities is included. (GEA)",

        "description":"This document describes women college students' perceptions of their experiences as student assistants (SAs) in a writing/reading/study skills center. To examine changes in the student assistants' perceptions of their growth, investigators compared two samples of their writing: reflective essays written before the SAs attended orientation or worked in the position, and reflective essays written after they had worked for a year in the center. Eight goals/themes emerged from a content analysis of the initial essays. Four kinds of goals were expressed: social-interpersonal, caring, educational, and vocational. The concerns expressed by these women were categorized into interpersonal/relational, doubting knowledge, doubting skills, and responsibility toward the center. Excerpts from  student writings were presented to illustrate both goals and concerns. Caring and empowerment were two major themes which emerged from the final essays at the end of a year's work in the center. Student assistants developed perspectives of themselves as relational leaders who felt connected to the students they assisted and connected to the center. They had a sense of caring and responsibility for listening well, for making decisions about what to teach, and for deciding where to begin. The cooperative atmosphere reported seemed also to stimulate the client students' confidence in learning and the student assistants' personal confidence as well. (GEA)",

        "description":"This paper chronicles the effort of a curriculum development team to alter the high school social studies curriculum, its content, and instructional methods. Specifically, Entrepreneur/Economic Education (E-3) is the focus of this curriculum reform effort. The E-3 program is designed as a four-year cooperative effort involving selected teachers, administrators, and students in the School District of Philadelphia, the Center for Private Enterprise at Baylor University, Widener University's Center for Economic Education, and the Pew Charitable Trusts. Teacher education courses allow collaboration between teachers and the curriculum development team. E-3 is designed to have a major impact on the lives of students chosen to participate in the program. It also reaches non-participants  by infusing special units into the ninth and tenth grade social studies curriculum. Selected students enroll in an 11th-grade entrepreneurship elective course comprised of economic concepts, principles, and analysis of private and public entrepreneurial activities. Summer internships give students the opportunity to work with individuals engaged in entrepreneurial activities. The 12th-grade course combines macroeconomic understanding with the development of a plan to start a venture of their own. Student development and presentation of a business plan requires application of knowledge gained from their courses and internships, and provides practical experience in planning for a venture. The program is based on the principle that curriculum change and implementation in classrooms is best  accomplished through the collaborative efforts of those affected by change. Attempts are being made to establish E-3 in school districts throughout the nation. (GEA)",

The newly formed board will sponsor the development of procedures for the voluntary certification of teachers to a standard of advanced competence--a step beyond simple state licensure. The advanced certification is to be controlled by the profession, not by the state, and it is voluntary, not mandatory. It aims not at entry-level, safe practice, but at advanced levels of knowledge and skill. It should accommodate and encourage innovation and change within the field. A description is given of the teacher assessment project which was created to explore and generate alternative strategies  for assessing teachers knowledge and skill. A discussion is presented on the possible consequences for educational policy and teacher education of introducing the concept of board-certified teachers into the educational system. (JD)",

The project targeted four major improvements. These include: (1) the establishment of a systematic plan for the identification, recruitment, and selection of able teacher candidates; (2) the creation of four inquiry-based seminars; (3) the establishment of field experience under the guidance of mentor teachers; and (4) the establishment of an individualized system of advisement in teacher education. The intention of this project was to produce beginning teachers who are competent in both the art and science of teaching, mentors who are better prepared to support the development of teachers, and university  faculty who can present preservice teachers with research-based information and opportunities for inquiry. This report describes the development and implementation of the program. An evaluation and assessment of progress is presented as well as major outcomes. The implications of the ATEP for others is discussed and the institutional features of the project are considered. The overall strengths and limitations of the ATEP are briefly outlined. (JD)",

People's ordinary conception of thinking includes imagining and remembering, judging and interpreting, as well as aspects of caring and feeling. To understand the scope and meaning of teachers' thought researchers must broaden and diversify their ideas and also reconsider the assumed links of teacher thinking to action and utility. The paper analyzes the concept and activity of contemplation as one crucial process of teacher thinking that directs and supports the comprehensive practical life. Defining contemplation as careful attention and wonderstruck beholding, it examines subject matter and children as primary objects of teachers' contemplative concern. An argument  is made for the practicality of contemplation by developing a concept of practice that goes beyond what an individual teacher does or what can be typically observed in teaching. The paper contends that contemplation and practice in a moral sense mutally involve each other; in reality, the activity of contemplation depends on political and practical wisdom. The paper includes examples of teacher contemplation and draws on philosophical work, both classic and current, for illustration. (Author/JD)",

Participants had completed their preservice education at an urban mid-western university five and six years ago. Results indicated: (1) more nontraditional-aged teacher education graduates are teaching five and six years after certification; (2) initial differences between the groups diminished after five or six years of teaching; (3) nontraditional-aged teachers perceived a variety of factors as helpful in preparation for teaching; and (4) traditional-aged teachers are more inclined to set goals outside the classroom, such as administrative positions.

Many school boards in Ontario now provide their elementary teachers with a guaranteed minimum amount of scheduling time for purposes of preparation, planning, and other support activities. Drawing on a sample of 18 schools in three school boards, the study investigates how preparation time is perceived and used in a board where such time is being newly instituted, in a board where preparation time has been in place for some years, and in a board where such time is related to a specific initiative designed to foster collaborative planning among teachers. The study  focuses not just on perceptions and uses of preparation time in particular, but also on the nature of the broader aspects of the work which teachers undertake outside of their scheduled class time. Five interrelated dimensions of time are discussed, particularly as they apply to teachers' work: technical-rational time, micropolitical time, phenominological time, physical time, and sociopolitical time. A warning is raised that the administrative tendency is to exert tighter control over teachers' work and their time, to regulate and rationalize it and to break it down into small, discrete components.

        "description":"A new field component for the teacher education program at Michigan State University includes the use of collaborating mentor teachers each of whom oversees an individual preservice teacher's field experiences for a two-year period. Instead of simply providing a classroom context for students' field visits, mentor teachers studied the Academic Learning Program goals and research base; collaborated with Academic Learning faculty in the design, evaluation, and revision of field assignments; and guided prospective teachers' work in the field. Thus, mentors played an active role in the teacher education process. This paper describes a study conducted in 1987 and 1988 involving 65 prospective teachers and their mentors and 12 case study students and their mentors selected from the  larger group for more detailed data collection. The paper then discusses four issues concerning the collaborative relationship between faculty and mentor teachers centered around providing educative field experiences for prospective teachers: (1) the learning-to-mentor process; (2) the evolution of the mentor teacher role; (3) mentor teachers teaching faculty; and (4) the faculty role in the collaborative process. The study focuses on understanding students' developing knowledge and understanding of teaching for conceptual understanding of subject matter, and their ability to use their developing knowledge and skills to teach for conceptual change.

The goal of the essay is to look more closely at the influence of context and situation on the conversation of teachers--not only a means of interaction, communication, and thought but also a type of relationship with one's surroundings. The discussion centers around the three partners to a conversation--a practitioner, colleagues (those sharing an interest or objective), and a place (a community of involved persons). The assertion of the essay is that community and place have value, and moreover, that community and place are necessary for healthy practice and healthy people. The conversation of teaching, to be effective and health-giving, must be  embedded in a community of practice and place. In school settings, these communities are built through dialogue and discussion, collaboration, services rendered and received, conjoint successes and failures, celebration, and mutual support.

It then examines several fields of professional education, some of which have exclusively adopted one or the other of these traditions and some of which have not made such a commitment. The paper argues that, even though an emphasis on either orientation at the expense of the other can do a disservice to their students, there are several reasons why professional educators can adopt such an exclusionary stance, the principal one being that they are unable to develop strong community norms while sustaining a tension between these two traditions. The fields examined are medicine,  engineeering, law, architecture, and several other professions. (Author)",

        "description":"The ability of the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) and undergraduate grade point average (GPA) to predict success in medical school was studied, and two complementary methods of determining if the tests are biased against ethnic groups were examined. Data from 497 majority and 82 minority medical students at the College of Human Medicine at Michigan State University (East Lansing) over a 6-year period were used to test for predictive validity and differential prediction. Majority status was defined as all other groups except Black, Mexican American, Mainland Puerto Rican, and Native American. The National Board of Medical Examiners Part I (NBME-I) examination was used as a measure of student performance in medical school. Science GPA and a composite MCAT score (the  biology, chemistry, physics, reading, and quantitative subtests) were evaluated as predictors. Moderated multiple regression and the Cleary model (Cleary, 1968) were used to determine whether test bias was present in science GPA or MCAT scores. The interaction of ethnicity with the predictors was also evaluated. Both the science GPA and the composite MCAT scores were valid and predictive of success in medical school as measured by the NBME-I. Both were equally valid for minority and majority groups. There were significant mean differences between the groups, but ethnicity did not affect the meaning of the scores in terms of predicting success on the NBME-I. Moderated multiple regression was the more sensitive measure of differential validity; the Cleary model can confirm results of a  moderated multiple regression equation. (SLD)",

Two specific research questions were addressed: (1) whether the Mantel-Haenszel and Rasch procedures identify the same items as functioning differently; and (2) how consistently each method identifies items with DIF over administrations. The sample included all black and white examinees who took one of the Georgia Teacher Certification Tests during the December (1987), March (1988), or June (1988) administrations. Item data from these three administrations within the content fields of early childhood (n=1,344; n=1,291; and n=1,023, respectively), middle childhood (n=1,009; n=845; and n=785, respectively), and administration and  supervision (n=220; n=216; and n=252, respectively) were used in the analyses, and the differential performance of black and white examinees on these items was examined. The agreement between the two procedures was fairly high within the three administrations, but it dropped significantly when common items were examined across the administrations. The reliability of each procedure was also examined. The data suggest that the Rasch procedure is more consistent in identifying items with DIF than is the Mantel-Haenszel procedure. Further, the data suggest that quantitative indices of DIF are preferable to categorical indices for both procedures. Promising areas for future research on DIF are discussed, and the implications of the findings for theory and practice within the context of teacher  certification tests are presented.

The development of the PASS is described, from its initial test with 310 third graders, through its refinement after administration to 642 students in grades 3 through 6 in two elementary schools in Canada. The United States normative study was undertaken in 1988, using a sample of 831 children in grades 3 through 6 in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. The mean full scale PASS score for the total sample was 46.49, which is very similar to that determined in Canadian testing. The effects of grade level and ethnic  background are discussed. Data are presented concerning the relationships between PASS scores and measures of: (1) other personality factors; (2) achievement outcomes; (3) intelligence; and (4) teacher perceptions. Recent studies have indicated that the PASS can be used with junior high and older students, especially those with learning problems.

        "description":"Although the importance of systematic evaluation of educational policy and practice is well established, various problems confound the intention of evaluating regional or national activity with regard to computer-related activities in education. At least two of these problems relate to a general conception of the appropriate entry points for evaluative activity, while at least two other problems relate specifically to computer-related policy and practice. At least one additional layer of difficulty applies when the evaluation of such activity involves an external evaluator working internationally, particularly in the less developed countries. Each of these classes of impediments is briefly analyzed and a general model for evaluating regional and national-level computer-related  educational activity is discussed with respect to the classes of impediments and illustrated in the context of an ongoing external evaluation of a national educational software development project in the Netherlands. This activity--titled the &quot;POCO Project&quot; after its Dutch name meaning software development for computers in education--has the organizational goal of developing a first set of 18 software packages in 18 months. It focuses on developing educational software that can be used by teachers in a meaningful way during their regular teaching activities and with such frequency as to strengthen the teachers' perceptions that using such packages is an effective and efficient response to an educational need. The particular advantages of an outside evaluator are emphasized in this  description of the POCO Project. (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"The development of critical ethnography in education is traced, and the central epistemological and methodological issues in the practice of critical ethnography are discussed. Some of the directions the field appears to be taking are considered. Critical ethnography in education began in the late 1960's and early 1970's, with roots in the interpretist movements of anthropology and sociology. By the early 1980's, ethnographic methods and critical theory and critical feminism were well-entrenched among a small segment of American educational researchers. Subfields in which critical ethnography has been used include: (1) student subcultures; (2) curriculum; (3) administration and policy; (4) teacher education; (5) comparative education; (6) gender; and (7) vocational education. A  major issue in critical ethnography is that of validity, which is explored in an analysis of the relationships of theory to data and knowledge to ideology. The issue of reflexivity is at the heart of any discussion of ethnographic method. Critical ethnography is in its infancy as a genre of social analysis. New directions that the field appears to be taking include: (1) historicity and locus of analysis; (2) &quot;critical linguistics&quot; and the ethnography of communication; and (3) the study of progressive outliers and collaborative action research. Although there is a growing body of epistemological and methodological analysis in works concerning critical ethnography, there is yet little practical advice.

Based on a 1984 law, the State Board of Education adopted the following effective schools indicators as bases of assessments: (1) instructional leadership of the principal; (2) emphasis on academics, including basic skills; (3) high expectations related to student achievement; (4) positive school climate; (5) frequent monitoring of student progress and use of progress information in curriculum planning; and (6) positive home/school relations. In 1985, the State Department of Education (SDE) initiated development of needs assessment surveys for use in the 3-year planning cycle beginning in 1988-89. Of the 91 school districts in the state, 89 used at  least one of the survey forms, and 84 returned their surveys to the SDE for optical scanning and scoring. Surveys were received from 938 schools, including teacher surveys from 883 schools, parent surveys from 881 schools, and student surveys from 549 schools. Reliability and validity studies were conducted for each survey instrument. Results indicate a high internal consistency. The scores on the scales discriminate adequately between schools, rather than only within schools. The relationship between the survey scores and a school's organizational level (elementary, middle, or secondary), socioeconomic classification, and average student test gains indicate concurrent validity. Sixteen data tables are provided. The parent, student, and teacher/staff surveys are appended. (TJH)",

        "description":"The present study involved the testing of two common multiple-choice item writing rules. A recent review of research revealed that much of the advice given for writing multiple-choice test items is based on experience and wisdom rather than on empirical research. The rules assessed in this study include: (1) the phrasing of the stem in the form of a question versus a partial sentence; and (2) the use of the inclusive &quot;none of the above&quot; option instead of a specific content option. Limited empirical research suggests that using the partial sentence format and the inclusive &quot;none of the above&quot; option may lead to undesirable item and test characteristics, while textbook authors essentially are divided on their opinions about the validity of each rule. The items used in this study  were from the instructor's manual for D. Myer's (1986) text entitled &quot;Psychology.&quot; Items were randomly assigned to be rewritten to reflect the experimental conditions under investigation. Two instructors of an introductory psychology course selected 32 multiple-choice items for the study. The rewritten tests were administered to 228 students enrolled in two sections of an introductory psychology class. About half of the students in each section received Form A and the other half received Form B, resulting in 115 Form A and 113 Form B responses. The same manipulated items were combined with 18 different non-manipulated items in a third section of the class to comprise Forms C and D, whose administration resulted in 59 Form C and 59 Form D responses. Results offer no evidence to support the  use of either type of stem and limited evidence to caution against use of the &quot;none of the above&quot; option. Two data tables and examples of the four item formats used are provided. (TJH)",

        "description":"The purpose was to investigate the long-term impact of the California State University (Sacramento) Academic Talent Search Summer School (ATSSS) by means of a longitudinal follow-up of students at an interval of 4 years. A group of 100 academically talented middle school students (grades 7 through 9) were selected from the 350 participants in the ATSSS at California State University in 1984. Qualifications for the program were based on scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test or equivalent test scores. During the summer, students studied fast-paced mathematics, writing, and/or Latin. Four years later, in 1988, a questionnaire was mailed to the selected students to determine their high school experiences. A response rate of 80% of the 100 locatable students gave a sample that  compared favorably with the 1984 summer school group. Responses were analyzed descriptively using frequency distribution and cross-tabulation tables. Results indicate that: (1) program participants viewed the experience as highly positive; (2) academic acceleration through the program was associated with positive changes in school grades as indicated by grade point averages, interest in school and learning, and in students' abilities to get along with intellectual peers, age peers, and adults; (3) the program contributed to self-esteem and feelings of self-control; and (4) participants performed well in sports as well as academics. No pattern of social maladjustments or harmful results from the acceleration was found. (TJH)",

        "description":"A theory of learning based on recent insights from sociology and semiotics is explicated. Building on the work of Vygotsky, Dewey, Halliday, Barnes, Deely, Eisner, and others, this sociosemiotic model of learning is used as a frame of reference for thinking about the process by which texts are created from sensation. It is argued that the process by which learners come to make sense of their world is virtually the same for all learners. The essential nature of the social dimension of learning must be recognized. The story of two boys learning by watching a spider illustrates that learning is a social and psychological semiotic process. The process by which sensation, context, foreground, text, and data pool interact is psychological; and this process allows people to interact as  members of a social community. While the apparatus for cognition is psychological, the substance of the process (the data perceived and the texts created) is sociological. A social theory of learning posits that knowledge is a construction of beliefs derived from the learner's active participation within a social community. Knowledge is based in part on empirical observation, but sense is made of what is perceived through the learner's active search for patterns of understanding, using present needs and past experiences. Eleven flowcharts illustrate the relationships among aspects of knowledge and learning. (SLD)",

Questions examined were: (1) whether the use of a particular curriculum results in greater achievement in specific language areas; (2) what differences and similarities exist among these curricula; (3) do differences exist in the ways in which the curricula are implemented; and (4) in what settings is each used. Focus was on determining whether and to what degree the eight language curricula affected achievement in different language areas. In all, 110 schools and 2,750 students in grade 8 participated in the evaluation. The data set is representative for the last grade of primary education in the Netherlands. The effects of the curricula were assessed by a series of tests  representing the curriculum's objectives. Although there were many practical and theoretical problems in comparing the curricula, analysis of variance did not indicate any differences in effectiveness among these curricula. It was not possible to calculate differences in the implementation of these curricula. These findings do not imply that education could do without language curricula; without them, good education is not possible. Teachers should be coached to implement these curricula in the proper way. When effective variables are built into the curriculum it might become more effective, and the determination of effectiveness might be enhanced. (SLD)",

Characteristics of participants were studied to determine if certain types of persons are more likely to conduct follow-up activities to increase their skills after assessment. Of the initial sample of 104 educators who took part in a regional school administrator assessment center project over a 2-year period, 46 returned mailed questionnaires (the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), the Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale, and an information sheet) and agreed to be interviewed by telephone. Forty-two of these subjects had taken some developmental action in the area  of skill improvement. Those who took improvement actions were fairly equally distributed by gender, race, assessor's overall evaluation scores, and experience in education and administration. The large majority worked on developing two or three skills and there was a strong tendency for respondents to seek to improve the skills that had been rated relatively low during the assessment center process. Improvement strategies included a wide variety of activities, from enrollment in a formal course to finding a way to practice a skill on one's own. When participants rated their own improvement, intuitive types on the MBTI tended to indicate more improvement than sensing counterparts. Reasons sponsoring agencies gave for participation in assessment did not relate primarily to the efforts of  participants to improve their skills. In the final analysis, many more participants used the process in selection than previously indicated. The participants appear to have created their own opportunities for growth, indicating that a formally structured program is not a necessity for professional growth after assessment. Ten tables provide study findings. (SLD)",

This instrument is widely used to assess the implementation of exemplary practices in compensatory education. The SAICPQ is a self-report questionnaire consisting of 13 subscales representing correlates of achievement in studies of effective schools and classrooms. Out of a total of 201 educators familiar with Chapter 1 in 40 school districts in four states, 167 educators returned completed self-assessment instruments. The reliability of the total instrument and each subscale was computed. Further analysis then suggested rough ranking of the subscales by the degree of construct integrity. Exploratory factor analyses then further described the relationship of items to  subscales. All but two subscales had reliabilities above 0.80, indicating generally strong internal consistency. Analysis suggested that subscales E (staff development) and G (leadership) may be reliable measures of distinct constructs and in little need of revision, but that subscales A (climate) and M (excellence rewarded) did not appear to measure distinct constructs. Exploratory factor analysis also provided moderate evidence of support for the overall construct integrity of the self-assessment instrument. Modifications to improve the internal consistency of the instrument are discussed. Four tables and one graph present study data. The SAICPQ is appended. (SLD)",

For the application of the theory, a utility function must be specified. Usually the utility function is chosen on a priori grounds. In this paper methods for the empirical assessment of utility functions by decision makers are discussed and methods for the analysis of the data are described. These methods are of two types: methods for the analysis of a subject's utility structure, and methods for investigating the type of utility functions. The procedures are illustrated using an example from selection and one from classification. In the example from selection, data from four psychologists and six judges selecting and  evaluating applicants for training were analyzed for 10 subjects. In the example from classification, data from 28 subjects with four recommendations each were used. It is concluded that decision makers can specify their own utility functions and that decision theory can be applied to practical situations in education and psychology.

Results indicate that Dutch and American versions of the QTI had the same internal structure, and that Dutch and  American teachers displayed the same interpersonal behavior toward their students in many aspects. American teachers wanted to be stricter than did their Dutch colleagues; Dutch teachers wanted to give students more responsibility and freedom. This implies that Dutch teachers emphasize affective outcomes to a greater degree and that American teachers emphasize cognitive outcomes to a greater degree.

For this item set, the GR model provided more information than did the PC model for both the rating scales examined. In some cases, one might prefer the PC model because of the  fewer parameters to estimate and the minimal gains to be expected by using the GR model in this context.

The study was undertaken to determine the validity of the assumption underlying item response theory (IRT) that there are fixed item parameters that can predict performance. The Rasch IRT model was chosen. The three experimental tests were constructed from 950 items found in the JOCRF's item bank. The population seen at the JOCRF ranges in age from 14 to 60 years. Personality tests administered to subjects included Mandler and Sarason's Test Anxiety Scale and a short series of test-taking strategy items. All subjects took a minimum of 18 aptitude tests. Three primary factors were included in the analyses: (1) level of test anxiety;  (2) ability; and (3) difficulty order. Results of the study indicate that item difficulty order, test anxiety, and ability all affect performance, violating assumptions of IRT. It appears that the theory neglects to address the effects of individual differences on test behavior. Adaptive testing techniques are reviewed, and the theories of test anxiety and associated measurement instruments are discussed. New testing strategies are proposed in which personality variables and test characteristics can be incorporated as parameters, allowing tests to be manipulated in a manner that maximizes performance.

Additional analyses provided some support for the theoretical propositions of self-efficacy, but suggested that the males and females in this study differed in judgments of their computer capability.

        "description":"Expert systems can be used to aid decision making. A computerized adaptive test (CAT) is one kind of expert system, although it is not commonly recognized as such. A new approach, termed EXSPRT, was devised that combines expert systems reasoning and sequential probability ratio test stopping rules. EXSPRT-R uses random selection of test items, whereas EXSPRT-I incorporates an intelligent selection procedure based on item utility coefficients. These two new methods are compared to the traditional SPRT and to an adaptive mastery testing (AMT) approach based on item response theory (IRT). Three empirical studies using different tests and examinees were conducted. Study 1 included samples of 25 and 50 current or former graduate students who took the Digital Authoring Language Test;  Study 2 included samples of 25, 50, 75, and 100 students in an introductory graduate-level course; and Study 3 included 333 college freshmen and sophomores. Results indicate that the EXSPRT-I is more efficient or as efficient as is the AMT model. When the distribution of examinees was not clustered near the mastery cutoff, all four methods made accurate mastery classifications. Although further research is needed, the EXSPRT initially appears to be a strong alternative to IRT-based adaptive testing when categorical decisions about examinees are desired. The EXSPRT is less complex conceptually and mathematically; and it appears to require many fewer examinees to empirically establish a rule base, when compared to the large numbers required to estimate parameters for item response functions  in the IRT model.

The ERIC Clearinghouse on Tests, Measurement, and Evaluation (ERIC/TM) contributes to this database by acquiring, selecting, and processing documents pertaining to all aspects of testing, evaluation, and learning theory. The ERIC/TM has become a vital resource within its area of expertise. The scope of the ERIC/TM includes tests and other measurement devices, and documents that discuss such instruments; methodology of measurement and evaluation; evaluation of programs, projects, and procedures; research design and methodology; human development; and learning theory. Improvements needed by the ERIC system are: (1) serving a wider audience within the educational community;  (2) expanding dissemination activities for this audience; (3) collaborating more closely with existing systems and networks; and (4) controlling quality. Recent improvements to the ERIC/TM have been in the areas of improved document acquisition and processing; better quality and more relevant products; and improved dissemination of information. The ERIC/TM is establishing a structure to make all these activities possible; the cooperation and involvement of the measurement community is essential. (SLD)",

        "description":"This paper describes teacher usage of the microcomputer programs Test Analysis Package (TAP) and Student Problem Package (SPP) to analyze students' test item responses. These methods of organizing, analyzing, and reporting test results have proven useful to classroom teachers. The TAP consists of four integrated microcomputer programs to edit, score, summarize, and analyze student test data at either the item or objective level. The SPP is a program for analyzing student responses on tests based on the Student-Problem Curve Theory developed by T. Sato. Standard reports include student summaries, item summaries, and test summaries. Information available for item analysis includes item ranking in order of difficulty, frequency distributions by quintiles, point-biserial correlations  between response options and total test score, and modified caution indices for items (a measure of the irregularity of the responses to the items). The reports also include information useful for analysis of student achievement, including individual student percent correct data, student ranking within the classroom, and objective mastery data. Much of this information is organized into a Student-Problem Chart--a useful, easy to use summary chart of student responses. Illustrations and examples of these reports and their use by classroom teachers are appended. (TJH)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of correlated dimensions and differential ability on one dimension on parameter estimation when using a two-dimensional item response theory model. Multidimensional analysis of simulated two-dimensional item response data fitting the M2PL model of M. D. Reckase (1985, 1986) was conducted using the MIRTE analysis program. Six data sets (2,000 ability vectors by 104 items) were generated to satisfy two conditions of the distributions of the ability dimensions and three different degrees of correlation between two abilities. The six data sets (two distributions times three correlations) and analyses were replicated 100 times each. Summary statistics on the 100 replications were used to assess the effects of the degree of  correlation between ability dimensions and differential ability on the second dimension. Results indicate that the MIRTE program recovers the structure of a multidimensional correlated space better than do previous estimation programs, especially in the cases in which the items were multidimensional in themselves. However, the MIRTE program tended to underestimate the degree of correlation between the ability dimensions, but it did not force orthogonality on the dimensions. Because of the limitations imposed on any single body of research in terms of research design, some alternative situations need to be studied. Future investigations should assess the accuracy of estimation procedures when a guessing parameter and different latent space structures are included. (TJH)",

More specifically, this report describes the relationship between educational attainment and the components of the SES index as used in the National Longitudinal Surveys conducted by the National Center for Educational Statistics. Findings demonstrate the pervasive importance of parental education and family affluence. These factors were key to students' postsecondary attainment, even when aspects of home environment were taken into account. Home environment factors were less important overall, and many were found to have no independent influence on  educational attainment. Only parental involvement during high school was of significant impact when social background factors were controlled, although students living without either parent had significantly lower attainment compared to others with otherwise similar backgrounds. These preliminary results do indicate that there may be interaction effects between parental involvement and social background as well. (TJH)",

        "description":"Thirty-three counselors attending a workshop at the 1988 Annual Convention of the American Association for Counseling and Development were asked to rate six &quot;critical incident&quot; exercises on bias in test content and unfairness in test usage. About two-thirds of the subjects were female, and one-third were male. The subjects ranged in age from 31 to 64 years, with a mean of 45 years. About 30% of the counselors worked in elementary or secondary schools, another 30% were employed in 2-year and 4-year colleges, and the remainder were in a wide variety of other work settings. The six simulation exercises presented to the participants dealt with counselor use of test information at the elementary, secondary, and college levels. Despite special efforts at the beginning of the workshop  to define and explain differences between biased test content and unfair test use, many of the participants seemed to be confused and were unable to reach a decision. Few significant relationships between counselors' background and experience and their ratings on these exercises were found. Recentness of having taken a course or workshop in measurement and work setting appeared to be more related to the ratings than did gender, race/ethnicity, age, highest degree, or years of counseling experience. It is recommended that workshops or inservice programs be developed for counselors to instruct them in means of detecting test bias and using tests fairly. (JH)",

Anrig stated that subjects who &quot;know the same amount about a test item&quot; should have a similar chance of answering it correctly &quot;regardless of their race, sex, or ethnic background.&quot; Linn and Drasgow stated that an adequate approach to detecting item bias &quot;requires a means of distinguishing between differences that are due to group differences in the developed skills of the test takers and those that are due to extraneous factors.&quot; The latter researchers propose a one-dimensional item response theory (IRT) criterion. However, this procedure provides no agreed external criterion for making a  judgment concerning bias. A requirement to select those items that minimize group differences on the final test does appear to meet a general requirement for equity; this is the procedure forwarded by the Golden Rule Insurance Company in its debate with the Educational Testing Service. It is concluded that: (1) there may be no purely technical solution to the problems of test bias; (2) the test construction process should recognize the need to make ideological and social choices; and (3) IRT theory will not provide a solution.

To date, approximately 14% of the reviewed documents have been rejected and 38% transferred to other clearinghouses. Major review criteria include relevance and timeliness, methodology, and effectiveness of presentation. This study was conducted during  November and December of 1988; 17 measurement specialists acted as external reviewers of the ERIC/TM review process. Thirty documents were selected from among those reviewed previously by the clearinghouse; 20 of these were randomly selected from a group of documents that had been accepted since June 1988. In addition, 10 documents rejected since August 1988 were selected. The agreement rates between ERIC/TM and the external reviewers suggest that ERIC/TM is reviewing and accepting documents in a manner consistent with the expectations of the educational community.

In addition to analyses of test results, questionnaire data from participating teachers were assessed. The  teacher questionnaire covered seven areas--item difficulty, test instructions, test fit with the curriculum, language correctness and appropriateness, racial or ethnic test bias, print size and illustrations, and cultural relevance of items. Results indicate that the PRRE and SABE are acceptable for the population assessed.

If multiple rankings of the same objects are available, then the parameters of the objects can be estimated, along with their standard errors and also with statistics summarizing the fit of the data to the measurement model. This paper summarizes the relevant theoretical principles associated with rank ordering and presents an example of this sort of analysis. The example includes H. Polskin's (1988) rankings of seven play-by-play baseball announcers on six specific items of performance. The application of the principles of fundamental measurement to rank ordered data provides the means to convert entirely local rankings into generalizable measures of the latent abilities. Moreover, fit  statistics for each object and for each ordering enable a determination of the success of the ranking process as a measurement operation. (TJH)",

Among non-Hispanics, by contrast, poverty rates have declined during the recovery, making Hispanics the only racial or ethnic group whose poverty rates remain at or close to recession levels. Although measures of national economic conditions such as the unemployment rate were at about the same level in 1987 as in 1978, Hispanic poverty rates were sharply higher in 1987 than in 1978. This is due in part to a worsening poverty rate for Hispanic married-couple families. Poverty has grown at an especially rapid rate among the following Hispanic groups: (1) children; (2) the elderly; (3) high school  dropouts; and (4) Mexican Americans. Puerto Ricans still have the highest poverty rate. The rise in poverty has affected all regions of the country. Poor Hispanics are growing poorer. Hispanic incomes have also declined, and now fall farther behind the income of the typical White family than at any other time on record. Nearly one out of every four Hispanic families is female-headed. Although the Hispanic unemployment rate has declined, the wages being paid to Hispanics have eroded, and now fall well below the levels of the late 1970s. Federal budget policies have cut programs that benefited two-income households; this disproportionately affected Hispanics. Tables and figures illustrate the data. (BJV)",

Interviews were conducted with administrators in superintendents' offices, in dropout prevention planning, and in programs for pregnant and parenting students. Among the findings were the following: (1) administrator's knowledge of this group of students is uneven; (2) support for young mothers is more limited than support for pregnant girls; (3) assistance for pregnant and parenting students is usually organized as innovations in service delivery rather than as improvements in institutional policies; (4) pregnant and parenting dropouts get shortchanged in programs set up to respond to student pregnancy; (5)  dropout prevention initiatives slight the needs of pregnant and parenting students; (6) coordination among public sector agencies working with teenage mothers is limited; and (7) administrators' proposals and plans for improving help to pregnant and parenting students do not pay adequate attention to policy reform and interagency collaboration. Recommendations for improving young mothers' educational opportunities are offered. (BJV)",

        "description":"New data issued by the U.S. Bureau of the Census and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) show that most poor households in the Buffalo (New York) metropolitan area pay extremely large portions of their limited incomes for housing costs. Housing is considered affordable for a low-income household if it consumes no more than 30 percent of the household's income. Yet, nine out of every 10 poor renters and nearly half of all poor homeowners in Buffalo paid more than 30 percent of income for housing in 1984. The problems of finding affordable housing faced by the poor worsened appreciably from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s in contrast to the housing burdens of more affluent households in the area. The poor were also more likely to live in substandard housing.  The increase in the shortage of low-rent housing since 1976 can be attributed primarily to large declines in household incomes and modest increases in housing costs, particularly for black renters. Government assistance through subsidized housing programs is not available for most poor households, and benefit levels for cash assistance programs have declined sharply in New York State in recent years. Most national analyses forecast that the gap between the number of low-income households and the number of units affordable by these households will grow substantially larger in the years ahead. Statistical data are included on three tables and 13 graphs. An explanation of the market-basket standard of affordability used by HUD is appended. (FMW)",

        "description":"Census data on poverty in 1987 indicate that the economic recovery has been uneven, with the poor sharing less fully in the gains than in prior recoveries. Despite a drop in the national unemployment rate from 7 percent in 1986 to 6.2 percent in 1987, the poverty rate of 13.5 percent has remained essentially unchanged. Although 1987 represented the fifth year of economic recovery, the poverty rate was higher than in any year in the 1970s, higher even than during the major recession of 1974 and 1975. Although the unemployment rate was about the same in 1987 as in 1978, poverty rates were substantially higher in 1987 than in 1978, when the rate was 11.4 percent. The data are especially disturbing for blacks, whose poverty rate rose significantly in 1987 to 33.1 percent, and for  young black children, whose poverty rate rose to 49 percent. The income gap between rich and poor families reached its widest point in 40 years. In addition, the average poor family fell further below the poverty line in 1987 than in any year since 1960. Poverty rates for certain groups, such as children, remain at very high levels and have climbed considerably over the past decade. While alternative measures of poverty in which non-cash benefits are counted as income can be useful in providing consistent measures of poverty trends since 1979, the measures are of questionable value in estimating the number or proportion of people who are poor. Statistical data are included on two tables and three graphs. (FMW)",

        "description":"The effects of cooperative learning on students' perceptions of themselves and their roles in academic settings are explored. A group of 28 students from seven intermediate classrooms in an urban school system were selected to be videotaped while participating in a cooperative problem-solving lesson and were subsequently interviewed. The students were grouped heterogeneously by race and sex, and homogeneously by ability. The students' responses to the cooperative learning setting were analyzed within the following four major categories: (1) achievement level; (2) personal worth; (3) formation of friendships with students of different ethnic groups and sexes; and (4) enjoyment of school. Although responses in all four categories were positive for the majority of the students,  significant differences in the perceptions of black and white, and of female and male students were found. These findings suggest that despite the demonstrated value of cooperative learning settings, they may subtly reinforce racial and sexual normative roles. The study concludes with the following three recommendations for future research: (1) teacher effect and experience should be considered and controlled; (2) individual group dynamics should be carefully studied; and (3) teacher role in structuring outcomes in cooperative groups should be investigated.

High housing cost burdens have serious implications, including the growing problems of homelessness and hunger. Data on national trends and housing conditions suggest that just as the affordable housing problems worsened dramatically for low-income households between the mid-1970s and the mid-1980s, so too are they likely to deteriorate further in the years ahead unless major changes are made in government policies and in the actions of the private sector.

The following topics are analyzed: (1) housing burdens on poor  households; (2) factors contributing to the housing crisis for the poor; (3) substandard and overcrowded housing; (4) housing assistance for the poor; (5) ominous trends for subsidized housing; (6) characteristics of poor renter and homeowner households; (7) housing problems of Black and Hispanic households; and (8) housing problems of elderly, single-parent, and young households.

Of the 17,236 students in educational options schools and programs, 56.8 percent (9,791) were randomly assigned to their school or program, and 43.2 percent (7,445) were selected by their school or program. Analysis of the data on these students leads to the following conclusions: (1) approximately two-thirds of all students admitted were ninth-graders; (2) over 80 percent of both selected and randomly assigned students were admitted to a school or program in the borough in which they lived; (3)  there were few differences in the percentage of males and females admitted; (4) a student's program choice was based more on the probability of obtaining a job with a career path than on pursuing further education; (5) both the reading and mathematics skills of the randomly assigned students were substantially lower than those of the selected students, both in the final year of middle school and the first semester in high school; (6) the randomly assigned students had a poorer attendance pattern than the selected students, and earned fewer credits; (7) the change in policy has increased the diversity of the entering student population with respect to middle-school achievement and attendance.

        "description":"Since 1982, the Congress has expressed concerns regarding voluntary agency use of an accountability for Federal refugee reception and placement grant funds. The Refugee Assistance Extension Act of 1986 requires increased financial and program reporting by the voluntary agencies. An assessment undertaken to evaluate the adequacy of this reporting reveals that Congressional concerns over fund use have not been effectively addressed. Financial reports provide insufficient assurance that funds are spent in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and within the terms of the cooperative agreement. Current limitations allow voluntary agencies to maintain cash balances of as much as one year's expenditures. Reports to the Congress have not provided an accurate description of the  proportion of Federal funds used for direct refugee assistance. Among the findings are the following: (1) the financial reports are inadequate for full accountability; (2) current limits on fund balances may not be reasonable; (3) reports do not accurately identify funds spent on direct services; and (4) the appropriateness of the federal contribution is still unknown. Modifications of reporting requirements and audit responsibilities will better serve Congressional and State oversight of the reception and placement programs. Data are provided on three figures.

An evaluation of programs in four large-city school districts revealed that educational reform has been neither a disaster nor a boon for the performance of low-achieving students: the reforms have not improved educational outcomes to any great extent. All students demonstrated a very similar achievement pattern to that of at-risk students. The educational reform may have done less to aid Hispanic students than Blacks. The reforms did not improve the performance of students no at risk; nor did they have any effect on dropout rates, though they may have contributed to a small decline in  vocational enrollments. Prior progress was not maintained for some disadvantaged groups, at least over the short-term. The long-term effects of the reforms have yet to be seen. If the educational reforms did not have the damaging effects on low-achievers that some feared they would, neither did they produce the general advances that advocates of reform have hoped for.

Information was culled from interviews with and observation of 46 black students, their peers, teachers, counselors, parents, and others. Findings indicate that the presence of a modified caste system prevents the majority of black students from crossing cultural boundaries and achieving academic success. Many of John Ogbu's findings in his Stockton study and subsequent research were corroborated in Fairfax: the teacher's perceptions of their black students were molded by their own cultural perceptions and historical experiences. The black  students and their parents were generally viewed in terms of their birth-ascribed status rather than their achieved status. Teachers generally attributed the underachievement of their black students to cultural deprivation and lack of parental concern, and had limited knowledge and understanding of the back students and their families. Communication with parents rarely occurred before the student was having difficulty in school, due to the teachers' low expectations of parental interest and the tendency of black parents to avoid communication with the teacher. Recommendations to ease the black students' crossing of cultural barriers are offered. A table illustrates some of the data. A 69-item bibliography is included. (BJV)",

Among the findings are the following: (1) the number of homeless persons increased by an average of 25 percent over the past year; (2) the fastest-growing group among the homeless is families with children; (3) over 40 percent of the homeless population now consists of members of families; (4) increasing numbers of homeless persons are working but unable to find housing that they can afford; and (5) the single most important cause of homelessness is the extreme shortage of affordable housing. Drastic cuts in Federal funding for housing programs for the poor have led to the rise in  homelessness. The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act was an important first step, but Congress must do more to effect a long-term solution to homelessness. The creation of 350,000 new units of Federally-subsidized housing is recommended. An overview of Federal housing policies is appended. A chart illustrates the data. (BJV)",

        "description":"In 1987, the New York City Board of Education established the following three placement units responsible for improving school attendance and preventing dropping out among at-risk youth: (1) the Central Placement Unit (CPU); (2) the Persons In Need of Supervision (PINS) Diversion Unit; and (3) the Bronx District Attorney's Educational Outreach program. The overall program goal was to return out-of-school youth under agency care to public school settings and to ensure the delivery of appropriate services. During the first year of CPU-PINS's existence, the Board of Education's Office of Research, Evaluation and Assessment (OREA) examined the roles of the three program components. This paper reports on the OREA evaluation. Evaluation procedures included the following: (1) two  literature reviews (included as appendices); (2) staff surveys of Board of Education and agency programs appropriate for the target population; (3) a staff questionnaire; and (4) structured interviews with all placement unit staff. The OREA evaluation found communication lacking among units, resulting in disorganization and confusion, despite documented records of re-connecting students with educational placements. Eight recommendations were forwarded for the correction of CPU-PINS problems. Appendix A reviews characteristics of at-risk youth and includes 17 references. Appendix B reviews effective placement practices and includes 12 references. (AF)",

        "description":"In this study of rental assistance programs for low-income households administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the General Accounting Office (GAO) compares the costs and benefits of housing certificates and housing vouchers. The certificate program, established in 1974, and the voucher program, authorized in 1983, aim to create an alternative to the construction of low-rent housing by providing low-income families with subsidies for private rental housing. The GAO study, prompted by a request from the Senate Subcommittee on HUD-Independent Agencies, also investigates the costs of converting outstanding housing certificates to vouchers and assesses HUD's fair market rent (FMR) structure and its effect on tenant rent burdens. The GAO study finds that  while housing vouchers provide families with more flexibility to &quot;shop around&quot; for suitable housing and with higher subsidies than certificates, the voucher program is more costly and serves fewer families. The GAO finds that HUD's budgeting processes are inconsistent, that HUD FMRs are not always accurate, and that the cost of converting certificates to vouchers would be high. The report includes one table and ten figures. Appendices provide the following information: (1) methodology; (2) contributing public housing agencies; (3) HUD response to the report; and (4) major contributors. (AF)",

Data were collected from students and their families during the 1983-84 school year as part of the National Evaluation of the School Nutrition Programs (NESNP). Each program was analyzed separately since the extent of student coverage varies. Primary focus was on the estimates of how student participation was affected by changes in the meal price, a key policy tool that program administrators can use to influence both student participation and program revenues simultaneously. The price elasticity of participation provided a convenient measure to judge student response to change in meal prices. Findings  indicated that participation in the NSLP was generally inelastic; students were relatively unresponsive to lunch price increases. Participation in the SBP was found to be more elastic; as breakfast prices increased participation could be expected to drop rapidly. Statistical data are included on four tables. A 16-item bibliography is appended. (FMW)",

Approaches favored by conservatives, such as strengthening behavioral standards for children, sponsoring demonstration projects at state and local levels, and giving families with children more choice over the government services they receive, would probably cost between $1 and $4 billion annually. The more comprehensive approaches favored by liberals, which emphasize developing skills and safeguarding health while meeting basic needs for food, shelter and clothing, would probably cost between $10 and $20 billion annually. Different combinations of funding  strategies could finance even the most expensive programs, but each has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. The following strategies are evaluated: (1) federal financing through conventional budget procedures; (2) special federal financing mechanisms; (3) state, local, and private financing; and (4) reallocation of federal funds already spent on children.

        "description":"The United States has one of the highest poverty rates in the industrialized world, especially among its children and the working poor. The underclass is comprised of a group of 2.5 million chronically poor people who live in inner-city communities where crime, drug abuse, teenage childbearing, dropping out of school, and welfare dependency are commonplace. Poor children should receive priority attention for the following reasons: (1) they are far less likely than other children to become healthy, productive adults; (2) their numbers are growing; (3) a disproportionate number are minorities; (4) they are not responsible for their circumstances; (5) future workers must be well-educated and well-trained; (6) many cost-effective programs already exist; and (7) the social  consequences of neglect are large. The working poor should receive priority attention because inability to support a family makes a life of welfare or crime more attractive and erodes the work ethic, and recent welfare reforms have enabled people to obtain jobs but not to move out of poverty. The following options are suggested: (1) expand effective federal programs; (2) support state-local-private efforts; (3) build knowledge on how to help the disadvantaged; (4) remove bureaucratic impediments to effective efforts; (5) provide federal development grants; (6) increase the minimum wage; (7) increase the Earned Income Tax Credit; (8) provide health insurance and child care; and (9) increase remedial and job training.

It investigated the perceptions of 73 Idaho secondary school administrators and 81 vocational agriculture instructors toward the influence of the factors on enrollment. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Studies, with subprograms, Frequency, Friedman's Two-way ANOVA, and Wilcoxon's Matched-pairs Signed-rank test. The 13 factors, identified from the literature as limiting vocational agriculture enrollments, were rated significantly differently as to their effect by respondents. The four factors rated as having the most limiting effect on enrollment were scheduling conflicts, change in  students' interests and attitudes toward agriculture, competition with other elective courses, and academically gifted students guided away from vocational agriculture. The five factors rated as having the least limiting effect on vocational agriculture enrollment were the supervised occupational experience program requirement, vocational agriculture used as a dumping ground, inadequacy of tools and equipment, limited facilities for vocational agriculture students, and students living in urban areas. Administrators and instructors rated 6 of the 13 factors significantly differently. (YLB)",

        "description":"Peer Advising in Agricultural Education has been operating since the Fall Semester, 1987, at Texas A &amp; M University. The program involves several undergraduate students nominated by faculty, who are supervised by two doctoral students. Responsibilities of the peer advisors include informing students of campus procedures, assisting in prescheduling course work, offer peer advice on questions of a personal and academic nature, giving directions, and being a good listener. From 12-14 students provide the services of peer advisement on weekdays; students volunteer two to four hours weekly. A journal records daily student contacts, including the type of support provided. Over 200 contacts were recorded for the 1987-88 academic year. An unforeseen result of the peer advising program  has been the number of contacts that peer advisors make outside the Peer Advisement Center. Peer advisors report that they have been approached by fellow students to a greater degree outside of regularly scheduled hours. Program modifications for the second year are the establishment of minimum criteria for the selection process and changes in the nomination process. (YLB)",

Directors, of whom 52 returned usable survey forms, were asked to identify the five major roles that agricultural extension agents would play. A review committee used the data to compile a survey instrument that was administered to the same population. Directors rated 72 statements as to the perceived importance of each as a role of agricultural extension agents in the year 2000. The scale ranged from 5 (essential) to 1 (not important). Ten statements achieved overall mean ratings of 4.25 and above. The statement with the highest rating placed the agent in the  role of \"problem solver bringing to bear the resources of the land grant university on the needs and problems of the clientele.\" Four of the top 10 items related to the agent's role as a link between the clientele and the research community. Other items related to the agent's role as a program planner, in community economic development programs, as an educator, and as a user of technology to deliver information to clientele. Statements dealing with policy and political roles of agents generated the most differences of opinion among respondents. Recommendations were made to ensure that the Extension Service will be fully prepared and equipped to meet future needs. (YLB)",

        "description":"A study examined the impact of vocational education enrollment on the occupational aspirations of high school students, after correcting for the effects of other variables that also affect those aspirations. The data used for the study were collected in the High School and Beyond Sophomore Cohort study, second follow-up, when former students were age 30. Variables taken into account were gender, socioeconomic status, grade point average, and basic ability. The results showed that the major contributor to basic ability was socioeconomic status. Basic ability was the major contributor to both grade point average and to vocational enrollment pattern, whereas vocational enrollment pattern was the major contributor to occupational aspiration. The study concluded that even when  correcting for the effects of gender, socioeconomic status of family, basic ability, and high school grade point average, the students who enrolled in vocational education express lower occupational aspirations than nonvocational students. The results of the study thus support earlier findings that enrollment in vocational programs produces reduced occupational aspirations among students. However, the study recommended further research to determine what variables other than the ones studied produced the actual effect, as well as the fact that vocational educators stress the upward mobility possibilities of vocational education, not just entry-level jobs.

Chapter 1 introduces the concept of allied health occupations and traces briefly the evolution of 10 fields. Chapter 2 examines various data sources and discusses ways of forecasting the demand for and supply of allied health personnel. Chapter 3 looks at forces such as demography, disease patterns, the structure of the health care delivery system, and women's study choices that have an impact on the demand and supply of allied health personnel. Chapter 4  reviews national projections of the demand for allied health workers up to the year 2000. In Chapter 5, recommendations are offered to increase recruitment of students, including minority students, into allied health education programs and to improve the capacity of educational institutions to deliver allied health programs. Presenting the employer's perspective, Chapter 6 reviews options for correcting and adapting to supply imbalances and outlines a role for health care administrators in enhancing the size and effectiveness of the allied health work force. Chapter 7 discusses state licensure and other types of control of allied health personnel. Chapter 8 examines long-term care and the needs it poses for allied health personnel. Each chapter contains references. Appendices include the  Congressional mandate, list of workshop participants, list of allied health job titles and program classifications, data on labor supply/demand estimates and projections, criteria for approval of certifying agencies, and a list of historical source material.

The survey focused on the processes of curriculum and instructional decision making and student decision-making behavior. The 105 tables in the document are organized into five major categories: institutional characteristics and administration; linkages to external agencies; occupational programs and instruction; career guidance/placement office; and student characteristics. Within each major category, the tables are grouped by subject matter. The table of contents lists the order of 27 subjects within the five categories. Finally, an index to the digest can be used  to find individual items of interest. All the tables present the data by institutional type and for the entire sample. Most of the data entries are unweighted means or frequency percentages. In other cases, rank orders of unweighted data are presented. The survey instruments are appended to the digest. (KC)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to collect and examine information on the nature and extent of business and postsecondary occupational program linkages. Data were gathered through a telephone survey of 76 administrators of postsecondary institutions that had both high and low linkages to private industry, and of 661 employers, half of whom were currently involved with secondary institutions and half selected randomly. The study found evidence of considerable private sector interaction with postsecondary institutions, such as in employment recruitment, cooperative work experience programs, advisory committees, and career information programs. The study noted that the motivating forces and time perspectives of educational agencies and employers differ significantly. Employers are motivated  by economic factors such as profit and loss and tend to have short time frames. If they are to become involved in postsecondary education, they want to know how it will benefit them or their firm economically and they want payoff periods to be as short as possible. The educational institutions, on the other hand, have much longer time frames and are motivated by the teaching and learning process. Five possibilities for governmental action were identified. The findings suggest that additional or improved collaborative efforts would benefit all parties and society as a whole. (Sample selection methods, interview forms, and 13 references are appended.)

A secondary purpose was to identify the opinions the business owners held about high school vocational graduates and their abilities as entry-level employees. The four-page questionnaire was completed by 9,100 business owners. Survey respondents were mostly male, predominantly white, and mainly middle-aged. Two out of three started their businesses before age 35 and generally in an urban setting. Business owners with a vocational education background, especially high school vocational education, were generally younger, started their businesses at significantly earlier ages, and were more evenly dispersed between urban and rural settings.  Ohio business owners reported considerable involvement with vocational education. The percentage of Ohio business owners with some vocational education was nearly three times the national percentage. Those respondents having high school education started their businesses at substantially earlier ages, reported higher than expected levels of education, and were more likely to operate in a rural setting. Ohio business owners generally held high school vocational graduates in high regard. Implications for future curriculum and program development for vocational education were suggested. (YLB)",

The panel discussed 45 issues and dilemmas in client-consultant relationships, covering a variety of consulting roles. Among the recurring themes advanced by panel members were the following: (1) plan for your consultancy relationship; (2) market your services or products specifically; (3) be the expert; and (4) do what you say you'll do.

Using an extensive data set that combines vehicle data collected by the Automobile Club of Southern California Target Car Program with the responses from a national household survey of new car buyers, a statistical model of vehicle type choice was estimated. The basic finding from the analysis is that individuals do express a demand for safety. Holding constant all other factors that influence a consumer's vehicle purchase decision, a safer vehicle is found to increase the probability of purchase. Among the specific findings of the analysis are the following: (1) an index of crashworthiness is a strong determinant of purchase decisions; (2) passive restraint  systems enhance the likelihood of purchase of a given model; (3) safety-related recalls in the previous year are found to produce a positive effect on purchase behavior; (4) longer vehicles offer more crash protection to the occupants and increase the likelihood of purchase; and (5) other characteristics found to be important are purchase price and fuel costs, interior comfort and roominess, performance, and brand loyalty.

These programs were designed to encourage employees' early departure through some form of financial incentive. Telephone interviews were conducted with company officials at a random sample of 71 of the 1987 Fortune 100 industrial companies. Findings indicated that about 80 percent of Fortune 100 companies sponsored an exit incentive program at least once during 1979 through 1988, according to company officials. About 30 percent of these companies required their employees to sign a waiver as a condition for receiving enhanced benefits. Overall, waiver usage  increased during the years 1985-1988 and was highest in 1987 and 1988, when 35 percent of companies with exit incentives used them. Officials from companies that required waivers said such a practice protected the company from lawsuits. Companies not using waivers contended that they were unnecessary because of the voluntary nature of exit incentive programs and the adverse effect that waivers would have on employee relations. (Appendixes include interview and data verification procedures and companies' reasons for waiver choices.) (YLB)",

The Executive Exchange Program Voluntary Services Act of 1986 added this experimental component to encourage higher level private sector executives to participate, since their salaries would be paid by their private sector employers rather than by the government. Telephone interviews were conducted with 40 private sector executives who participated in the program during FY 1988 and 1989, 30 of their corporate employers, and 24 of their government hosts. All parties had generally positive views of the experimental component. The Commission's conflict of interest procedures appeared to be adequate for experimental component  executives. No disadvantages to the government were found. An inequity in the program was that private sector executives continued to receive most of their fringe benefits from their corporate employers, but federal participants were in a leave-without-pay status, and certain federal employee benefits were reduced or not available to them. The experimental component enabled higher salaried private sector executives to participate, resulted in savings to the government, and encouraged greater federal agency participation. (YLB)",

        "description":"The drug-testing plans covering 11 of the 12 civilian federal cabinet-level agencies met the requirements of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services guidelines, and the guidelines themselves were found to contain the elements required by Public Law 100-71. However, the drug-testing plans differ, so employees may find different circumstances depending on where they work. The frequency at which employees in testing designated positions (TDPs) would be tested varies from an annual testing rate of 4 percent to 100 percent. Five plans called for the testing of all job applicants, not just those applying for TDPs. Most agencies planned to test for marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, and phencyclidine. However, random testing in three departments will be limited to marijuana  and cocaine. Most plans cite a specific list of disciplinary actions to be taken when an employee tests positive. None of the plans discussed how its implementation will be affected by the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which may protect employees who are drug abusers from adverse actions unless the agency can show impairment of the employee's job performance or a direct threat to property or others' safety.

The survey queried a group of 16,651 employees that was representative of the full-time permanent work force in 22 of the largest federal agencies. Results showed that many federal employees held positive views of their jobs and that this viewpoint was increasing. Supervision accounted for at least some of these positive perceptions. A greater percentage of employees covered under specific pay-for-performance systems (Performance Management and Recognition System and Senior Executive Service) saw a link between performance and pay compared to those not covered. An overwhelming majority of supervisors reported that they take action to deal with problem  employees. Over three-fourths of supervisors who took formal actions against employees that resulted in appeals to the Merit Systems Protection Board believed that the advantages of taking such actions outweighed the disadvantages. The incidence of prohibited personnel practices based on political affiliation was practically nonexistent. Employees expressed concern about such issues as perceived negative image of the federal employee; disparity of compensation; and lack of correlation between written job elements and performance standards.

To be most useful, the manual should be used during training as a teaching guide and instructional tool. Although it provides useful charts, drawings, structural diagrams, and other meaningful information, some material would be difficult for the average generalist. Each principal unit is complete and substantially self-contained. Thirteen sections cover concepts of irrigation design; the soil as a reservoir for water needed by plants; water and plants; methods of measuring soil moisture content and availability; water requirements; natural rainfall and irrigation requirements; topographic mapping and surveying;  water source development; water distribution; field irrigation systems; drainage; economic evaluation and feasibility; and health and safety. With the aid of this manual, during and after training, a Peace Corps volunteer should be able to apply the principles and procedures of acceptable irrigation practices to almost any irrigation problem encountered on farms during service abroad. A training site is recommended that provides adequate land, enough water for the crops grown, and enough appropriate tools to accomplish the degree of sophistication required in a particular program. A list of suggested references and a table of measures and conversions are appended. (YLB)",

Chapter 2 discusses literacy work strategies--the Laubach method, the Freire method, and functional literacy, as well as literacy for women and children. Chapters 3 to 7 present a model for implementing a project.  These steps are described: the feasibility study, planning and preparation, curriculum design, implementation and evaluation of instruction, and development or adaptation of instructional materials. Examples and samples are provided. Chapter 8 discusses activities and methods to create an environment supportive of literacy. Chapter 9 provides advice on where and how to look for resources. An annotated bibliography dealing with literacy methods and materials is included.

It presents information on planning and preparing for literacy work, offers guidance on program and material development, and suggests strategies for evaluating and improving programs. Chapter 1 looks at the history and value of literacy, levels of literacy, the difficulty of literacy, numeracy, and adult, nonformal, and literacy education. Chapter 2 discusses literacy work strategies--the Laubach method, the Freire method, and functional literacy, as well as literacy for women and children. Chapters 3 to 7 present a model for implementing a project.  These steps are described: the feasibility study, planning and preparation, curriculum design, implementation and evaluation of instruction, and development or adaptation of instructional materials. Examples and samples are provided. Chapter 8 discusses activities and methods to create an environment supportive of literacy. Chapter 9 provides advice on where and how to look for resources. An annotated bibliography dealing with literacy methods and materials is included. In chapter 10, four case studies of literacy work done by Peace Corps volunteers illustrate common problems literacy workers face in implementing projects. (YLB)",

The workshop design combined technical presentations with appropriate hands-on experiential learning sessions. One of the principal goals of the workshop was to train teams of Peace Corps volunteers and host country counterparts in the concepts of agroforestry while at the same time strengthening their personal relationship. Emphasis also was placed on broadening  the participants' knowledge of different extension techniques and strategies and providing them with an opportunity to practice those techniques. The workshop also stressed the role of women in development, especially in forestry. The actual sessions on agroforestry focused on the ecological, economic, social and technical aspects. They included an historical overview; advantages and disadvantages; tree, crop, and animal production within a system; nitrogen fixing trees; project planning; seed selection and storage; and fruit tree preparation and management.

        "description":"Based on experience in the field, this training program was developed to help Peace Corps trainers teach appropriate community technology to Peace Corps volunteers and community workers. The 8-week, 104-session training program is organized in six phases that cover the following topics: introduction to training; earthen construction and fuel-saving cookstoves; pedal/treadle power; solar water heaters; solar agricultural dryers; and concluding the program--the energy fair. Each of the technical and nontechnical areas is related to the other components of the program. Health and nutrition and the role of the volunteer in development are stressed throughout the program. Nonformal education and cross-cultural education are the integrating principles of the program. Each session  outline contains total time, objectives, resources, trainer notes, procedures, and handouts as needed. Appendixes list skills for development facilitators, outline two-week workshops, and provide 14 pages of bibliographies. (KC)",

Specific recommendations include the following: presidential leadership in the development of national goals and timetables; school/business efforts to help students meet the educational  standards necessary for labor market success; inclusion of transcripts and achievement test scores in employer evaluations of job applicants; incentives for teachers, administrators, and school districts; experimental school restructuring; corporate tax credits for education and training; income tax exemptions for employer-provided education and training benefits; increased funding of the Job Training Partnership Act and for postsecondary training grants; a Cabinet-level committee for human resource policy; federal support of community-based child care resource and referral agencies; increased subsidy of child care expenses; flexible employment arrangements; performance standards for public employment service; sensitivity of immigration policy to labor market needs; innovative approaches  to labor-management relations; and increased funding for the collection of labor statistics, evaluations of human resource programs, and studies of best employment practices.

        "description":"In many respects clinical psychology has been more sensitive than most to issues related to gender, but many glaring problems remain to be addressed. In the clinical realm of psychology it is especially important to frame more inclusive conceptualizations of adjustment. Ursinus College developed a college-wide program aimed at greater integration of gender in the college curriculum. In this program small groups of faculty from various departments committed to curricular change joined to create reading groups. Participants critiqued their current courses and developed new approaches with the help of their interdisciplinary colleagues. Extensive reading on such topics as feminist therapy fostered an expanded awareness of some of the sexist and racist underpinnings of the field, but  more importantly afforded a new perspective from which to reexamine some of the core assumptions that underlie mainstream approaches to the teaching of therapy. Transforming how the classroom operates in light of new understanding of differences in students' ways of knowing will allow more students to embrace their educational experience. Strategies for increasing student participation will emphasize ways to make the classroom atmosphere less personally threatening. Evolving an integrated curriculum requires long-term commitment to experimentation and change. (Examination of a psychology course on the major techniques of psychotherapy is included to illustrate the process of curricular revision. (ABL)",

        "description":"The goal of this research synthesis is to evaluate the validity of the claim that there are fundamental limitations on the ability of adolescents to engage in critical thinking. Critical thinking is defined as an analytic, focused cognitive activity aimed at understanding phenomena at a root rather than a superficial level; a type of thinking closely though not exclusively associated with formal thinking as described by Piaget. This paper examines what fundamental cognitive developmental limitations have been claimed or implied regarding adolescents' abilities to engage in critical thinking, what empirical evidence has been used to support or refute these claims, what empirical evidence exists to demonstrate that adolescents are able to engage in such thinking, and what recurring  themes emerge from consideration of all this evidence. Evidence is reviewed within four broad headings: (1) Piaget's formal operations; (2) biopsychological constraints; (3) individual differences; and (4) cognitive processing analyses. It is concluded that there is no persuasive evidence of fundamental constraints on the ability of early adolescents to engage in critical thinking. Sixty-three references are included. (NB)",

        "description":"This document presents a review of the research on experiences outside of the classroom that may affect student achievement during the high school years, focusing specifically on the areas of family influences, peer influences, part-time employment of students, and student participation in extracurricular activities. It reports on studies of familial influence on student achievement which have shown that family social class is highly correlated with school success, but that the relation between school performance and either family structure or maternal employment status is far less substantial than is widely believed. Research on peer influences is reviewed which suggests that most peers seem to encourage, rather than discourage, academic success. Studies on part-time employment  and student achievement are reported which suggest that employment in excess of 15 hours per week during the school year may adversely affect high school students' school performance and investment in school, especially among students who begin working when they are sophomores or juniors. Also discussed are studies examining extracurricular participation, most of which focus almost exclusively on interscholastic athletics. Findings from these studies are reported which suggest that participation in extracurricular activities is more likely to enhance than interfere with high school students' academic aspirations or achievement. One hundred and thirty-five references are included. (NB)",

        "description":"Research showing psychodynamic child therapy to be less effective than other forms of child treatment have used outcome measures focusing on symptomatic and behavioral change rather than on psychodynamic processes. A child therapy assessment procedure than measures the psychological functioning of the child in a psychodynamically meaningful way is needed to make a fair evaluation of psychodynamic child therapy. The Psychodynamic Child Rating Scale (PCRS) involves the administration of an abbreviated standardized psychological battery consisting of five subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised, nine designs of the Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test, the House-Person-Tree Test, the Kinetic Family Drawing, the Kinetic Peer Drawing, four cards of the Thematic  Apperception Test, additional child interview items, and a parent interview. The examiner uses the information obtained from this battery to determine the child's position in relation to eight dimensions or item-scales relevant for psychodynamic functioning: (1) Intellectual Functioning; (2) Ego Functioning; (3) Self-Concept; (4) Aggression Control; (5) Emotional Adjustment; (6) Family Relations; (7) Peer Relations; and (8) Psychosexual Development. Ratings are summed to obtain a Total Psychodynamic Functioning score as well as scores on two factors: interpersonal and intrapersonal. This document describes the PCRS, discussing each of the eight item-scales and identifying various anchor points for each item-scale. It presents evidence for inter-rater reliability, internal consistency, and  validity obtained from a study of 69 latency-aged boys who were assessed with the PCRS, as well as other measures, before and after therapy.

        "description":"This document presents a summary report of the hearing conducted by the Select Committee on Aging of the United States House of Representatives to study the quality of living of older American women who live alone. Section I reviews information collected by the committee, focusing on the unique circumstances and needs of older women. It provides background information on older women and older women living alone and examines income, health, safety, and housing factors which may affect the quality of life for older women. Section II analyzes testimony from the Congressional hearing conducted on September 27, 1988 to study the problems facing older women and to propose changes. It includes a list of witnesses testifying at the hearing and presents witness analyses of issues and  policy recommendations in the areas of income, health, and housing. The report concludes that: (1) not enough is known about the biological or social conditions women face as they age; (2) women face greater rates of poverty, more long-term chronic illnesses and disability, and a greater likelihood of living alone, without day-to-day physical, economic, and social support; and (3) both public and private institutions charged with obtaining information about aging and with assuring that older adults live with dignity and independence are failing to fulfill their mission on behalf of older women. The need for aggressive oversight; fair and comprehensive legislation; and innovative, equitable programs is recognized. (NB)",

        "description":"This book is concerned with the problem of student stress and the possibility that children and adolescents will internalize ineffective coping strategies used by adult models available to them. The introductory chapter explains a need for an educational plan to promote ways of controlling stress; recommends a systematic approach to managing stress; and describes roles of classroom teachers in helping students cope with stress. It reports that classroom management schemes that encourage student involvement, focus on positive interpersonal relationships, encourage the formation of positive self-concepts, and provide time-space arrangements in which individual and group needs can be met have been shown to promote mental health and eliminate negative stress. Chapter 2 looks at  sources of stress and differentiates between adult-perceived stress and child-perceived stress. Readiness for dealing with stress is discussed and identity anxiety is presented as a major source of stress. Chapter 3 examines stress in schools and classrooms. Time, space, and human relations dimensions of school stress and classroom stress are described and the impact of classroom stress is considered. Chapter 4 presents techniques for preventing and resolving teacher, environmental, and student stress. Extension strategies involving parents and communities are discussed. Chapter 5 presents a systems approach for dealing with classroom stress which consists of assessing the classroom ecology, formulating a plan of action, and creating a productive classroom ecology.

        "description":"Many researchers have examined the influence of perceptions on health related behaviors and efficacy perceptions have been shown to have powerful correlations with health behaviors. Most studies have focused on adults, few have looked at adolescents' efficacy perceptions about their health, and none have addressed the confidence teenagers have in their daily mental and physical health routines. The School Health Efficacy Questionnaire (SHEQ) was developed to measure adolescent perceptions of mental and physical health self-efficacy. A revised version of the SHEQ was administered to 449 high school students in grades 10-12. Twelve school nurses were asked to rate the items on the SHEQ, indicating how competent they believed the average high school student to be in each behavior.  Data analysis showed the SHEQ to have sturdy reliability and validity properties and to be a useful tool in evaluation studies addressing adolescent health issues. The results indicated that psychosocial health issues troubled the adolescent slightly more than did physical health issues. Findings suggest that teenagers are fairly consistent about their self-beliefs. Mental health problems were concentrated on anxiety-producing events and physical health difficulties centered around daily routines. Managing sources of anxiety and managing daily, routine behaviors were perceived by the students to be relatively difficult. Gender differences appeared throughout the analyses. (NB)",

The problems of the increasing numbers of children whose parents have divorced are discussed in \"Children of Divorce\" (Cindy Russell). \"Children of Alcoholic Parents\" (Joyce Jagucki) presents a clear case for greater teacher and counselor attention to the difficulties of children from alcoholic  families. \"Children Who Are Victims of Sexual Abuse\" (Debra Duetemeyer) provides alarming statistics about the number of abused children and guidelines for professionals to observe in identifying and working with these children. \"Children Coping with Death and Loss\" (Kathleen Ray) describes how schools can respond to these children in their sorrow. Finally, numerous esteem-enhancing resources that can lead to long-term rewards in student adjustment and achievement are discussed in \"Self-Esteem and Academics\" (Lynn Burton).

Three aspects of providing help if the cycle of running is to be broken and the youth directed toward achievement are discussed: (1) intervention considerations;  (2) levels of intervention for short-term programs; and (3) the use of drawings as an interview and assessment technique. Creating a positive future for the runaway is the topic of the fifth chapter, which focuses on understanding the problem, public recognition of the problem, reorganizing agency relationships, and research and program evaluation. The final chapter provides advice to parents whose children have run away and advises all parents to be prepared. (ABL)",

The first chapter discusses the interviewer's role, focusing on improving communication, dealing with emotion, the interviewer's response, male or female investigator, and team interviewing. The developmental stage of the child, dynamics of sexual exploitation, and juveniles as witnesses are discussed in the second chapter. Preparation for the interview is discussed in the third chapter, discussing the child's family, the medical examination, others present during the interview, decision to record, and selecting the interview site. The interview itself is the topic of the fourth chapter  which discusses beginning the interview, use of anatomically correct dolls, questioning the child victim, and closing the interview. Essays on special considerations in investigating ritualistic child sexual abuse and in obtaining and using expertise search warrants in cases of preferential child molesters are provided. A bibliography is included. The appendix includes charts categorizing the sexual victimization of children and situational and preferential child molesters, as well as a model of the cycle of violence.

Major findings include: (1) more than one million children nationwide experienced abuse or neglect in 1986; (2) over one-half of the countable cases involved abuse and just under one-half involved neglect; (3) moderate injuries predominated, occurring in 72% of cases; (4) countable cases of maltreatment in 1986 increased 66% over their 1980 incidence, primarily reflecting a significant increase in the incidence of abuse; (5) neither emotional abuse nor neglect showed reliable changes in incidence;  (6) females experienced greater abuse overall than did males; (7) the overall incidence of maltreatment increased with age; (8) there were no significant relationships between the incidence of maltreatment and a child's race/ethnicity; (9) low income was a significant risk factor for maltreatment; (10) noninvestigatory agencies such as schools recognized more than two times the number of cases than investigatory agencies such as the police did; (11) the proportion of cases known to child protective services which involved maltreatment showed no reliable changes; and (12) the number of children reported to child protective services increased nearly 57 percent. Results imply that the increase in countable cases probably reflects an increase in the likelihood that professionals will  recognize maltreatment, although abused and neglected children are not more likely to appear among screened reports to child protective services.

        "description":"In studying the causes of dating violence, researchers have investigated three broad areas: early life experiences, individual characteristics, and relationship characteristics. While each of these areas has been shown to play a role in dating violence, the interactive processes which lead to violence among dating couples have not been investigated. This study examined the degree to which individuals control others and the relationship of this control factor to dating violence. Data were obtained from a sample of 583 white heterosexual college students who were involved in a dating relationship. Data were obtained on 1,096 relationships. For an analysis on inflicting violence, complete data were available for 318 relationships for men and 286 relationships for women. For the  analysis of sustaining violence, complete data were available on 429 relationships for men and 426 relationships for women. Data were analyzed from men and women who inflicted and sustained violence while dating. The results indicated that, net to other effects, men and women who acted to control others were more likely to inflict and sustain violence while dating. Future research is needed to continue building upon the findings that interactional characteristics such as interpersonal control are vital to understanding interpersonal violence. (NB)",

The executive summary describes the success of deinstitutionalization in releasing large numbers of patients from state mental hospitals, but notes that the needs of persons with mental illness in the community have not been adequately met. It considers state legislative leadership to be particularly important in shaping the mental health system in each state and in meeting the needs of these deinstitutionalized persons. The book is divided into seven chapters. The first chapter provides an overview of the the situation, looking at the role legislators play in mental health, who the mentally ill are and what mental illness is, where the mentally ill are  and what services they need, treatment of the mentally ill historically and today, and major issues confronting mental health policymakers. Chapter 2 examines mental health care and treatment and chapter 3 examines mental health service organization and delivery. Chapter 4 discusses the evaluation of mental health programs; chapter 5 focuses on financing mental health care with federal funds; and chapter 6 addresses the financing of mental health care with state, local, and private funds. The final chapter presents future challenges in the field of mental health that state policymakers will face. Creative state approaches are offered throughout the book as strategies to address treatment, delivery, and financing concerns. A list of mental health information sources, a glossary, a list of  acronyms used in the book, and a bibliography are included. (NB)",

        "description":"While prospective investigations of social support, coping, and stress are accumulating, there is relatively little empirical knowledge regarding how these variables are related to each other among adolescents, and virtually no empirical knowledge regarding their relationship to subjective states in that population. This study examined the relationships of perceived social support from friends and from family, coping, and life events to concomitant and subsequent states of anxiety, anger, and curiosity. Subjects were 90 predominantly lower middle-class, minority girls attending an all-girls high school in an urban area. Subjects completed a demographic cover sheet, the Perceived Social Support from Family and from Friends scales, Problem-focused Coping Scale, Adolescent Life  Events Checklist, and the State-Trait Personality Inventory on two occasions one month apart. The results indicated that perceived social support was related to state anxiety and anger, as well as to coping; life events were related to anxiety. Partial correlations suggest that perceived family support may contribute to subsequent state anxiety and anger, and anxiety may contribute to subsequent life events. These findings have implications for prevention, and suggest a need for future research into the relationship between subjective states and maladaptive behavior. (Author/NB)",

It examined the degree to which schools' treatment of pregnant and parenting students complied with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and how schools have initiated steps on their own to encourage pregnant and parenting teenagers to stay in school. Twelve diverse schools across the country were surveyed. The findings revealed that few schools had clear policies about how to treat pregnant and parenting students. Nine of the 12 schools were found to have Title IX violations. None of the schools, however, used pregnancy or parenthood as a reason for expulsion or suspension and none required pregnant or parenting students to enroll in  special programs rather than staying in the regular classroom. Some schools reported having special initiatives to help pregnant and parenting teenagers stay in school. This report describes the study methodology and sample and lists Title IX problems which were found. It discusses key findings in the areas of attitudes toward pregnant and parenting teenagers, attendance, courses and programs, child care, working with other agencies, health services, extracurricular activities, and counseling and financial aid. Under each subject area are policies and practices that determine the school climate for pregnant and parenting students. (NB)",

The issue of new and emerging roles for counselors is the result of the need for a shift from counseling only for vocational placement to a concern for the intangibles resulting from the interaction between organizational change and evolving worker needs. It has been suggested that professional issues associated with this change will be focused around aspects of the economic and occupational environments with which counselors will interact and in which their clients will be emersed. Major departures in education and counseling need to occur to facilitate economic development. Curriculum and counseling need to be distributed over a wider  temporal span which extends into post-formal school arenas and later lifetime periods of individuals. The counseling effort should embrace not only specific client needs, but be broad enough to consider organizational, societal, and economic realities. Counselors formally involved in economic development strategies may assume some combination of roles. The counselor will need to acquire additional knowledge and skills to support these new and more complex roles. Meeting these challenges will contribute to individual and national ecomonic development. (ABL)",

This paper also presents a strategy for determining what skills and knowledge expert workers use when exhibiting \"expert work behavior.\" The job analysis described is a linear systematic process beginning with an understanding of the broadest view of an expert worker's activities and ending with a detailed summary of the specific skills and knowledge needed  to carry out each task in the expert's job. It also identifies psychomotor, cognitive, and affective factors associated with the successful job performance.

The roles and issues of disadvantaged persons in the work place and in national economic schemes are the subject of growing interest among economic planners, politicians, educators, and human resource development professionals. This paper was written to raise an informed awareness regarding disadvantaged workers. It presents a series of discussions of several socio-economic aspects of the emerging and existing disadvantaged worker. The discussions present a summary of the current and emerging critical elements of each topic and suggest foci and possible response tactics. The topics discussed include: (1) concern and bias; (2) transition to work; (3) phases  in adjustment to work; (4) restrictions on choosing and deciding; (5) influences of life education, and other unstructured experiences; and (6) dropouts.

In analysis of the 29 reports it was found that 19 mentioned counselors, counseling, career guidance, and/or career development. Of these 19, nine called for an increased emphasis on guidance and/or increase in the number of counselors and viewed the guidance and counseling movement as part of the solution for educational reform. Eight others criticized the guidance and counseling movement and/or called for massive changes in the ways in which counselors perform their duties. It was  clear from this study that the most important function reform leaders see counselors performing lies in the domain of career guidance-including assisting clients in education-work related decisions.

Despite the weaknesses of past curricula and the problems still to be addressed, prevention curricula are becoming more effective as time goes on. There is much that has been learned from prevention failures, as well as from a few successful prevention programs. Programs that increase drug knowledge are quite easy to develop, programs changing attitudes toward drug use are more difficult, and programs changing drug- and alcohol-related behaviors are quite rare. Yet many of the ineffective approaches are still being utilized in today's school-based curricula. If further advancements towards reducing the use of alcohol  and drug abuse problems are to be made, focus needs to be on approaches that lead to positive behavior change. Hopefully, the nation will continue to place the problems of alcohol and drug abuse by our youth in the forefront of issues, providing the support needed to continue making progress in the area of educational research and curriculum development.

Methods which are described include focus group probing, key informant interviewing, personal interviews, questionnaires, review of existing data, and primary and secondary focus surveys. Outcomes for two needs assessments are presented historically with the pre-award findings first, followed by subsequent data. They are presented under the headings of adolescent alcohol and drug use, school and community programs, state agencies, and  institutions of higher education. Annual needs assessments and development of plans for service delivery are envisioned due to the value of information in targeting training and technical assistance.

An evaluation system by Western Regional Center staff was developed to track the progress of \"school teams\" who were charged with developing and implementing action plans in their schools. The system consisted of three major components: a training evaluation component designed to assess the effectiveness of the Western Center's training and the progress made by local teams as a result of it; a mailed survey and  profiling system designed to take an annual region-wide look at the progress of local programs; and a computerized, relational database used to manage information on Center clients, their programs, the Center's technical assistance efforts with them and supplementary resources the Center can make available to them.

To assess need, officials at the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) National Institute of Mental Health, the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors, and mental health officials in 12 states were contacted. Results showed that monies allocated in fiscal year 1988 and those to be received in 1989 should be sufficient to develop the current plans by the September 30, 1989 due date. However, several officials noted that if plans submitted are not  approved, they would need additional funds to address HHS's concerns. Even if the plans are approved, state officials still see a future need to fund related activities, such as monitoring, implementing, evaluating, and updating plans. Most state mental health officials were uncertain whether their state legislatures would appropriate state funds to support these activities. HHS also saw a need for funding for oversight and technical assistance activities it is to provide. (ABL)",

A pretest/posttest design control group methodology was used to evaluate 81 staff members. Results of the study showed that: (1) staff satisfaction with working with mentally impaired and demented residents improved significantly after training; (2) the kind of knowledge required to care for Alzheimer's disease afflicted persons also increased; (3) proper knowledge of various tasks and positive attitudes toward the patients increased; and (4) the training group showed improved self-esteem after the training. Limits of the study were the voluntary participation of the staff and the smaller than desirable sample size; lack of  participation in all training sessions; and the lack of multivariate analysis instead of the pretest/posttest strategy which was used.

A correlation of 0.93 was obtained between observed and theoretical scores. A second test was performed in which the rank order of basal series units were correlated with Lexile ratings of text difficulty. A correlation of 0.99 was obtained. A third test was performed in which the correlations between test item difficulties and Lexile ratings were compared with correlations derived from nine measures of readability. Results  indicated that while the Lexile equation produced better correlations on average, analysis of variance revealed that the Lexile ratings did not provide a significantly better explanation of the test item difficulties than the readability formulas. Results indicated that the Lexile theory does account for a significant portion of the difficulty of continuous prose and can be used to generate normative and criterion interpretations of a score which would facilitate the direct matching of student abilities with reading materials of appropriate difficulty.

The sentences were constructed with either exception words (whose correct phonological forms can only be obtained using addressed phonology) or  nonwords (whose phonological form must be assembled). Results indicated that both forms of phonological recoding occurred with the older children, but that phonological encoding due to addressed phonology was observed in the younger children.

Subjects, approximately 2,000 Catholic school students and 30,000 public school students in grades 3, 7, and 11, had their reading skills assessed. Results indicated that (1) the reading disadvantage of minorities compared to whites is less pronounced in Catholic than in public schools at all grade levels; (2) Catholic school students whose parents expressed no interest in their children's schoolwork scored as well as students whose parents talk to them about their schoolwork on a daily basis; and (3) the disadvantage accruing from a  lack of early educational experiences appeared to make almost no difference in the reading proficiency of Catholic school students, while the lack of such experiences seemed to have an adverse relationship for students in public schools. Findings suggest that Catholic schools are particularly effective for those students who are at some social or educational disadvantage.

This information is based largely on  materials that were provided by the organizations and programs themselves. Shared areas of interest include reading skills (the problem of illiteracy) and reading motivation (the problem of aliteracy); the state of the book industry; books and technology; the potential complementarity of books and the media; censorship; the history of books; and the international role of the book. Publishers, booksellers, librarians, book researchers, scholars, teachers, and writers are among those represented in this directory by a selective listing of their professional associations.

Subjects, 66 college students fixating over 40,000 times, read lines of text from a computer screen and were instructed to read for meaning without regard to errors. Results of eye movement control indicated that the frequency of immediately refixating a word following an initial eye fixation on it varies with the location of the fixation and that the data fit a parabolic function. The study concluded that the observed curvilinear relation results naturally from models that postulate a linear decrease in acuity with retinal eccentricity. Effects of word length and cultural frequency on the frequency of refixating were also examined.  (Six figures and three tables of data are included; 27 references are attached.) (RS)",

Units of study can be organized around particular kinds of inquiry instead of around a literary genre or the themes of particular pieces. Readers can approach a poem by asking, &quot;What does this say?&quot; or &quot;What does it matter?&quot; Poetry can also sharpen thinking skills and teach children to deal with propaganda. In adult literacy education, the ambiguity of some poetry allows adult students to explore language in a non-threatening manner, since it invites unique explications rather than finding a right answer. The study of poetry can also be a  suitable preparation for the study of law by teaching students to analyze language, recognize ambiguity, and develop consistency in interpretation--skills needed in the study of law. All of these approaches promote instruction that places responses to poetry within the control of students, who might shy away from poetry under teachers who lecture, quiz, and dictate a poem's meaning and significance.

        "description":"An ethnographic study examined the role of language in an economics classroom. The researcher became an undergraduate economics student for one semester and concluded that the language practices in that economics classroom were represented neither by the transmission model nor the process approach to writing. The most valuable part of this ethnographic study, for both the researcher and the teacher, was the understanding of how difficult it is for any ethnographer to comprehend the lens through which he or she reads a community and how much researcher and teacher appreciated the opportunity to exchange views and to vent their frustrations about teaching. The researcher learned that if writing instructors want colleagues across the disciplines to review the assumptions behind  their views of writing and reading, teaching and learning, then the writing instructors will also have to be willing to examine their own assumptions about their field.

        "description":"Despite their impact on literary criticism, contemporary theories of reader response and deconstruction seem to have had little effect on the practice of teaching literature, and most teachers of introductory literature courses remain vague about what these &quot;new&quot; theories are and how they can be used. Proponents of some of these theories argue that there is a text fixed permanently in the world, with secrets waiting to be unlocked by the perceptive reader able to decipher its code. Other theorists contend that the text is rendered wildly unstable either by the vagaries of human personality or by the whims of the community that interprets it. A more useful theory is that &quot;the story&quot; is in fact central to the reader's involvement with a work of fiction, that it is what determines  the reader's engagement with and interpretation of the literary text and that students need to be invited into the process of story telling. In particular, stories about story telling can be helpful because they are metaphors for the reader-writer relationship and demonstrate how essential writers know their readers to be in both the making and the interpretation of a literary work. The struggle stories such as Nathaniel Hawthorne's &quot;Wakefield&quot; and Grace Paley's &quot;A Conversation with my Father&quot; suggest the struggle individuals are always engaged in to negotiate textual territory as tellers and listeners, while trying to respect the author's property rights as people stake out their readerly claim.

Some students were looking for the &quot;Right Answer&quot; and when they found it, they assumed that everyone would agree with them. Perry's notion of &quot;dualism&quot; helps to explain why such students rely on authority. The stages of relativism also help explain why some students could not think of anything worth writing about because everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Piaget's account of students' early attempts at mastering formal operations helps explain why some students refused to revise their papers after receiving criticisms from other students. Students at this  stage think hypothetico-deductively and construct an argument when they mean to persuade. Students at this stage are also egocentric in that they cannot comprehend why reality should not conform to the conclusions reached by logic. (RS)",

        "description":"Writing instruction reflects a growing appreciation of the value of talk. By implementing peer writing groups, teachers encourage students to give, seek, and react to oral feedback among themselves as they write, in addition to reacting to the teacher's traditional comments on finished papers. Collaboration in writing groups provides writers with an opportunity to read their drafts aloud and to discuss them face-to-face with a peer audience while the written product is taking shape. Studies of peer reaction show both positive and negative effects on revision. Preliminary evidence suggests that the nature of peer collaboration and feedback in classrooms where computers are used to teach writing differs from that in regular writing classrooms. Under certain conditions, computers as  writing tools appear to promote a collaborative environment, both in learning to write and in learning to use the technology. The literature suggests that the effects of peer comments on revision is not a simple cause and effect matter, but rather a complex one, dependent upon the interrelationship of multiple factors within the evolving social environment of particular classrooms and groups of students.

        "description":"Reading and writing are complementary activities--if not two sides of the same activity--and together they provide a model for instruction in writing and thinking. The classical rhetorical concept of imitation as analysis followed by genesis provides the connection between classical imitation and the recent reading/writing connections proposed for the composition classroom. Students should be exposed to a variety of models to allow them to develop a broader world view, and they must also develop a metacognitive understanding of language and communication which comes via theory in the classroom and analysis (classical imitation) which is then reinforced by original composition. When students understand the interactive relationship of the writer's context, the reader's context, and  critical analysis of the text, they will be able to see themselves as writers functioning in the same arena. In this way they become classical imitators of models because they understand their models and generalize from that understanding to their own writing. Teachers must provide a broad range of reading and writing experience in composition courses, undergirding that experience with a metacognitive scaffolding which will allow their students to see themselves as writers through a better understanding of what a writer does.

Results indicated that (1) basic writers' miscues are not related to how they read with the intention of improving texts; (2) basic writers can identify and  propose solutions to problems at the lexical, syntactical, and semantic levels of discourse; and (3) basic writers' perceptions of their writing processes correlate with what they actually do as they compose and read texts.

The collaborative writing of the two page executive letter of the company's annual report involved a 77-day production process, exceeding its deadline by six weeks. Data collection included: fieldnotes from participant observation (six to eight hours daily for 100 working days); audiotapes and transcriptions of 10 executive-letter editing sessions; research process log; oral interviews (43 taped and transcribed); personal documents (meeting notes and drawings); and official documents (external and internal reports and communication).  Analysis revealed that the finished letter largely ignored important audiences, including the company's policyholders. Several forces, identified by M. M. Bakhtin in &quot;Discourse in the Novel,&quot; acted upon the writing process. Centripetal forces, which unify and centralize the verbal ideological world, included time constraints and a &quot;get-along&quot; attitude. Centrifugal forces, which push toward fragmentation of language through specialization into dialects and discourse communities, included serial communication, the personal nature of the document, and different perceptions of the audience. Convertible forces--those acting as either or both centripetal and centrifugal--included the hierarchical distribution of power and the lack of clear directions. Analysis revealed that the interplay and  shifting alignment of numerous socially rooted forces may determine the outcome of group-writing endeavors.

Hypertext can be defined as writing designed to be read--and perhaps added to--along many different paths, at the reader's choice. What the computer does for hypertext is increase greatly the speed and potential number of the links between chapters or ideas. What writing specialists can do to help in the creation of hypertexts is (1) become familiar with the medium, since hypertext is a future of written communication; (2) insist on even greater sophistication and ease of use for hypertext; and (3) bring the knowledge of writing instruction to the solution of the problems inherent in hypertext. Discussions that are going on now about hypertext include research exploring readability variables, the&quot;node size&quot; (the quantity of information that makes up the basic unit of a hypertext document), and the debate about the links that lead from one hypertext to another. Discussions are also in progress among hypertext developers about the extent and nature of reader participation in the hypertext writing process. The founders of the hypertext concept have insisted that hypertext should remove the distinction between writer and reader, and so they have designed hypertext systems that permit the reader to annotate or even alter the hypertext document, while still preserving the integrity of the earlier writer's work. Writing specialists can help find the answers to what kind of reader activity should be provided for. (MS)",

What can be taught about writing, by teachers and textbooks, is what cannot be learned from reading written products. What can and must be taught is the process by which those products were produced. Because hypertext is nonlinear or multidimensional, because it can allow scrolling forward or backward in time, it can allow student writers to see &quot;behind&quot; finished documents to the processes that produced them. Hypertext thus has the potential--not achievable by normal, linear textbooks--to truly relate process and product.

        "description":"Honors education is not immune from the current controversy concerning the role of the literary canon. Indeed, the problem seems especially crucial for honors programs, for their curriculums are often multi-disciplinary in their approaches to culture and history. The solution may lie in what Linda Hutcheon calls the &quot;poetics of the postmodern.&quot; For Hutcheon, an essential strategy of the postmodern is that of the &quot;double voicing&quot; found in language itself--of installing and questioning, of enunciating and contextualizing. The double-voiced strategy can be used when discussing curriculum revision. This can be done by installing the canon using special texts which in turn question the canon. These texts are &quot;historiographic metafiction,&quot; and incorporate literature, history, and  theory of the postmodern domain. Through historiographic metafiction, all the assumed grounds of understanding are questioned. A three-semester sequence based on the tripartite division of history into Premodern, Modern, and Postmodern periods can accomplish the double-voiced honors curriculum. The first two semesters would be devoted to the installation of the canon. The third semester would then question the canon by using historiographic metafiction, such as Umberto Eco's &quot;The Name of the Rose,&quot; John Gardner's &quot;The Sunlight Dialogues,&quot; and Christa Wolf's &quot;Cassandra.&quot; (MM)",

        "description":"Postpedagogy--teaching within postmodern culture--begins in the belief that modern culture and all of its institutions, including education, has entered a vaguely defined post-condition called postmodernism. This post-condition is not simply an interesting artistic category or mere academic theory, but is a fundamental shift in modes of expression, sources of articulation, and horizons of expectations. To address these shifts, a corresponding condition must also be addressed--a new rhetoric is needed to describe this new understanding. This \"terra incognita\" will be between language and silence. This middle way will both honor the past and the present, and will take seriously as a way of knowing and being that \"all is always now.\" If education is going to adapt itself to this  postmodern condition, it must adopt a new rhetoric, or postpedagogy. For example, in a college honors program, daily practices are not separated from an understanding of the culture. Postpedagogy is the enactment of the understanding of the current cultural paradigmatic shift into the classroom. \"Rules\" of postpedagogy might include: (1) no content is unchanging; (2) the message is the medium; (3) all knowledge is provisional knowledge; (4) knowledge is posited as knowing; (5) knowing and being are interactive and invisible; and (6) authority is based on authorship. A pluralistic, collaborative body in the university will encourage ideas that enhance and review the curriculum while supporting proposals which seek a correspondence between the old and new paradigms.

Dispositional communicative competence is defined as a function of three dimensions (cognitive, affective, and behavioral) that must operate in tandem to produce personally satisfying outcomes across a majority of social interactions. The three general dimensions of dispositional competence are discussed in the paper and definitions proposed for each. Further, the relationship between situational and dispositional competence is articulated as well as the interrelationships among the three dimensions of competence. Finally, future research is discussed that is  designed to test the major assumptions of this approach to communicative competence. (Thirty-six references are attached.) (RS)",

        "description":"The popular model of collaborative learning views classrooms as contexts where nonmembers of &quot;valued&quot; communities become members by mastering accepted knowledge, discourse forms, and methods. Although attractive to educators, this model allows only for changes in individual students, not in &quot;valued&quot; communities. Further, its emphasis on &quot;normal discourse&quot; maintains established knowledge, promotes static definitions of communities, and suppresses the creation of new meaning and the dynamic process of communal redefinition. If educators seek to prepare students for the kinds of communities and organizations they will enter, then current collaborative methods are effective and appropriate. However, if their role is to promote critical thinking and to nurture students' existing power  to define their communities and to act within them, then methods that are dialogic and that focus on problem-posing must be explored. As a first step, educators should refuse to confine collaborative methods to classroom &quot;peer groups.&quot; They should promote the &quot;abnormal discourse&quot; that occurs when disciplines, departments, and classrooms come together. Redefinition of learning, thinking, and writing must be university-wide and must involve students in the process of critiquing the current educational system. (Author/RS)",

The accessibility of the computer has not only broadened the scope of electronic media research but has also helped media scholars to develop new, more accurate, and more reliable media research methodologies. Whereas in the past, electronic media researchers depended greatly on borrowed media research methodologies developed mostly by psychologists and social scientists, today the field of communication studies has developed its own media research methodologies. In an attempt to provide an overall view of the present state of affairs in media research methods, this paper outlines, discusses, and exemplifies innovative electronic research methodologies. The first section briefly  examines the three conventional approaches to electronic media research--the historical, descriptive, and experimental. In addition, it surveys the existing methods of electronic media research along with the established techniques or tools of data gathering. The second section deals with those new media research methodologies, instruments, and techniques adopted by media researchers since the information explosion caused by computer technology. The last section of the paper provides an overall view of the media research methodologies used by those in the field of communication studies and projects some future trends in electronic media research methodologies.

        "description":"Recent trends in television programming, in which women characters are portrayed more frequently than in the past in what had been traditionally male occupations, present new opportunities to examine the relationship of television use to the occupational desires of male and, particularly, female adolescents. A study examined this relationship in the context of social status constraints on the perceived opportunities of high school students. Subjects, 542 randomly chosen high school students in the Chicago suburbs, were given questionnaires on television viewing habits and perceptions. Findings indicated (1) that sex and social status interact to affect occupational desires, such that higher status females are more likely to desire traditionally male occupations than their lower  status female counterparts; (2) identification with male and female characters in domestic and occupational roles still follows traditional lines overall, and adolescents are more likely to identify with characters if they perceive the shows to be more realistic; and (3) depictions of non-traditional female characters may be affecting the occupational desires of some lower status female adolescents who identify with television characters in occupational roles. This last finding supports a model that proposes that television portrayals of occupations will be more effective among those who have the least personal experience with these occupations.

Results show that educators are split over the advisability of this undertaking. Survey responses varied consistently by position and by career-ladder status. Generally, superintendents and other administrators in the upper career-ladder levels responded more positively than did lower echelon administrators. Throughout Tennessee, more administrators have chosen not to seek higher career-ladder status than have opted to participate in the system. Overall, the school administrators surveyed do not perceive that the career-ladder program has improved  Tennessee schools--the original intent of the program. However, a majority of administrators believe that the career ladder has positively influenced specific aspects of education by providing opportunities for extended contracts, professional growth, leadership, classroom teaching, public financial support, and student achievement. Based on survey results, the study group has advanced several recommendations concerning program improvement, the evaluation process, personnel eligibility, salary, and research needs. The report includes 31 tables and 3 appendices: (1) survey questions generated by the study group; (2) the career-ladder survey; and (3) respondent group characteristics. (MLH)",

The paper addresses (1) how often decentralization involving a change in resource allocation procedures is mentioned as a possible response to demand for change in educational systems; (2) the nature of the demand for changes in school system organization; (3) whether decentralization reported in the literature shifts resource allocation procedures toward the school level; and (4) whether decentralization produces improvements in efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability. The study reviews 14 articles published  between 1980-88. Each article was analyzed to elicit answers to the research questions, and the results were tabulated according to sample size, attitude toward decentralization, nature of demand for organizational change, classification of the type of decentralization, and the results of the innovation adopted. Decentralization appears to be a positive innovation for addressing the demands for organizational change in school systems. Further research into the definition of decentralization and the development of a model of decentralization is required. More concrete, reportable research data are needed, in addition to more school-level studies of decentralization effects, including their impact on the budgeting process in school systems.

Although school-site management literature offers no procedural recipes, experience suggests that a certain configuration of concepts, processes, and enabling conditions can produce substantial and sustained school improvement. This paper defines principal concepts, describes primary school-site-management components, and outlines diverse applications of these concepts and components. Four concepts (focus on the school, expanded school team authority, teacher professionalism, and learner focus) are closely allied with four process components: (1) involving a wider group of stakeholders in decision-making; (2) empowering school stakeholders to make and implement decisions;  (3) restructuring curriculum, instruction, and the organization; and (4) evaluating and reporting results to the community. Districts and schools construct their own school site management models by developing and implementing policies and procedures for addressing these components according to their own understanding. School site management is actually a configuration of decisions about how involvement, empowerment, restructuring, and accountability will be accomplished. Typically, districts adopting school based management interpret, organize, and practice it differently, as shown in seven programs in Connecticut; Ohio; Washington, D.C.; Massachusetts; Rhode Island; and Florida.

Especially neglected are relationships among superintendents--despite their serving a critical function. This study examines the interpersonal network existing among district superintendents in Washington State. Using a sociometric test survey, the study examines mutually identified groups (cliques), individuals connecting between groups (bridges), isolated individuals (isolates), and the entire superintendent network throughout the state. Also examined are individual superintendent traits (age, ethnicity, gender, salary, years of experience, and district size) and district conditions influencing  the network's establishment and continuation. The study draws on three factors possibly influencing the degree of superintendent connectedness: affiliation, accessibility, and status. Analysis of affiliation attributes (nonwhite ethnicity, gender, age, and degree and credentialing institution) indicates that affiliation is the weakest of the three categories. However, accessibility (measured by educational service district membership) and status (measured by salary, years of experience, and student enrollment size) are important factors influencing the establishment of connections within the network. One-third of the superintendents studied were isolated from networks, and female superintendents failed to choose friends among themselves. Implications for induction, mentoring, and support  of superintendents are discussed. (23 references) (MLH)",

        "description":"Americans tend to value bigger as better. Conventional wisdom over the years has dictated that \"too small\" schools and school districts could not provide sufficient educational opportunities. Since 1930, the number of school districts has shrunk from 128,000 to less than 16,000. As districts consolidate, parents feel distant from schools and powerless to affect policy. At the same time, Gene Glass's definitive work stresses the learning benefits of smaller classes. This paper reviews current thinking on district, school, and class size as they affect learning in the classroom. A table summarizes correlations between size and various other factors, including state public school enrollments, minority, student concentrations, SAT and ACT scores, state poverty levels, per pupil  expenditure averages, teacher salaries, and Catholic school enrollments. Findings show that smaller is likely to be better. However, political and economic influences will probably prevent change based on size considerations. Robert Slater's research expands the appropriate class size question by relating class size to structural differentiation and school culture. The nature of instruction must also be considered. To achieve appropriate instruction, the group's size and composition must fit the instructional situation. A diagnostic-prescriptive model (like Bloom's mastery learning) with variable size based on instructional need seems logical. Also, home schooled children's superior test scores corroborate the smaller-is-better findings. People seem to learn, change, and grow in  situations where they have some control, some personal influence, and some efficacy. (15 references) (MLH)",

        "description":"Recent research suggests that a key educational reform step is developing interdisiplinary collaborative inquiry activities. Bringing together professionals representing diverse, interrelated disciplines yields a more thorough understanding of organizational systems. Despite widespread support for interdisciplinary collaboration (IDC), few projects are currently under way. This study aims to (1) discover faculty and administrator perceptions regarding factors influencing current IDC efforts at their institutions; (2) discover these groups' perceptions about factors most likely to promote future IDC activities; and (3) document current IDC activities within Ohio colleges and universities. The study selected 12 representative higher education institutions. Following completion of a  questionnaire, 46 participating faculty/administrators were interviewed. A preliminary data analysis was made using qualitative methods. Results showed great diversity of opinion among faculty and administrators. There was, however, general agreement regarding the factors most important to promote future IDC efforts. Currently, administrative structure, the role of funding and institutional priorities, merit and formal recognition, and faculty attitude and autonomy were significant promotional factors. Organizational inhibitors included physical housing, special languages, and hierarchical status associated with various disciplines. Current IDC projects included research and grant projects, program development and delivery, governance committees, professional organization memberships, and  activities such as joint authorship of books and articles. Future directions are discussed. Included are seven references and an appendix containing the study questionnaire. (MLH)",

Researchers have suggested that instructional leadership can influence teaching and classroom practices through the establishment of belief structures and school policies promoting an &quot;academic press.&quot; Based on current research findings, this paper hypothesizes a tie between student perception of classroom environment, principal instructional leadership as perceived by teachers, and student performance. Specifically, the study attempts to determine if teacher perceptions of principals' instructional leadership strength relate to differences in student perceptions of  classroom environment variables associated with effective teaching characteristics. The study used a sample of 16 public secondary schools throughout east Alabama. Measuring instruments included the Principal Instructional Management Rating Scale and the Classroom Environment Scale. Data were analyzed using standard multiple regression techniques. Results support the hypothesized relationship between classroom environment and principal instructional leadership. Teachers in classrooms where students perceived high cooperation levels see their principals as highly involved in supervising and evaluating instruction and communicating school goals. Surprisingly, students in schools whose principals are judged to be instructional leaders perceive their teachers as aloof and formal. Other  results and implications are discussed. Researchers still do not understand how instructional leadership affects student achievement. (34 references) (MLH)",

        "description":"Despite a profusion of mentoring publications, much information on the subject is opinion-based, retrospective, and reflective. In examining mentoring for career advancement, researchers have focused largely on proteges' experience. This study examined mentoring as a mechanism for career advancement, focusing on the mentor's perspective and seeking to identify what mentors did, why they did it, and how they saw the process before, during, and after the experience. The study also tries to identify whether special problems or issues arose as a result of cross-race and cross-gender mentoring. Using qualitative research methods, including indepth interviews and diaries, 25 subjects were chosen from three kinds of organizations--higher education, industry, and government. Only 15  actually participated. Mentors gathered at a symposium to discuss the role of mentoring in their careers, to explain their perceptions of the process, and to reflect on issues, problems, and other factors. After each mentor had selected a person in his/her organization with advancement potential and monitored this mentor-protege relationship for 3 months, a second symposium was arranged during which both groups shared their experiences. Two major findings emerged. There was enthusiastic agreement concerning the importance of mentoring. Mentors fell into two groups: \"true believers,\" who used mentoring as an organizational tool; and \"mystics,\" who felt mentoring should be a veiled process for a select few. Most mentors studied fit the latter category, which raises questions about mentoring  relationships and their effects on career advancement. Results also raised serious questions concerning the value of mentoring for women and minorities. (30 references) (MLH)",

By offering collegial support and practical assistance, these programs should help beginning teachers polish their skills, improve their chances for success, and encourage them to stay in the profession. As teacher shortages become a serious threat to education, mentoring programs offer a logical, relatively inexpensive approach to helping avoid this loss of potential. This paper describes the Ferguson-Florissant School District's four-phase plan to develop a successful program. In the first phase, the district's Human Resources Office, responsible for developing and implementing the program, sent all teachers an announcement brochure based on  information gleaned from a literature review and discussions with new teachers. The brochure profiled the successful mentor, emphasized a strong trust and caring component, and listed expectations for program participants. A month following the brochure's distribution, 75 teachers had submitted applications accompanied by principal recommendations. As new teachers were hired, human resources staff worked with principals to assign mentors. Phase II involved preparation of the mentor handbook. In phase III, summer training sessions using role playing and brainstorming techniques were provided for mentor teachers. Phase IV involved three one-on-one followup sessions with the Human Resources Director. The program's success has spurred efforts to sponsor a peer analyis/coaching program for all  interested district teachers. Included are three references. (MLH)",

At children's earliest ages, parents seem most successful when provided with information on child development and activities useful at certain stages of children's development. With preschoolers, the research supports reading aloud to children, encouraging exploration of the concrete world, and expanding children's experiences through trips, home activities, and viewing and discussing television together. When children enter school, parents can pursue supplementary activities sent home by teachers for the first three grades and reinforce school activities for the remaining grades. Throughout their  children's growing years, parents of the most successful children model behaviors most likely to help them do well--being hardworking and active, doing their best, putting work before play, and stressing self-discipline. Other helpful parent characteristics include being interested in children's interests, listening to children, being responsive to them, and respecting children even when they make mistakes.

        "description":"K.E. Ferguson's analysis of women's place in capitalist society and the concurrent elevation of bureaucratic structures seriously challenges administration analysts. According to Ferguson, modern bureaucracy requires constant maintenance in reifying its dominance structure and locating and suppressing opposition. This analysis can be applied to schools as bureaucracies and to women's entry as a challenge to dominant values in the administrative culture. This paper proposes a research program aimed at understanding school administration through examination of the culture's language, stories, preferred behaviors, and socialization processes. After reviewing several stages of research on women, the paper introduces a new stage exploring deficiencies in the administrative culture  itself. This stage acknowledges male-female differences in preferences, values, and moral decision-making; asks whether women's qualities are undesirable in the administrative culture; and lays the foundation for new research agendas. Next, the paper reviews five assumptions concerning recruitment into a hierarchically dominated administrative culture, suggests a series of research questions and designs to explore them, and notes studies beginning that exploration. The final section details a study of assistant vice-principals that illustrates this line of inquiry by examining the experience of women administrators as deviants. &quot;Deviant&quot; values are kept under control by the sponsored mobility system, which tightly defines competency and selects people resembling their sponsors.  Bureaucratic values appear to get in the way of sound administrative practice and discourage women from entering educational administration. These values must be unmasked before schools can benefit from women administrators' talents and alternative perspectives. Included are several tables and 82 references. (MLH)",

The findings were developed as part of an exploratory field study conducted in six public middle schools in a large urban school system. The sample consisted of five black male and one white female principals and 186 teachers (69 percent black and 70 percent female). At the completion of the field study, a questionnaire including the measures for the four research variables was distributed to all classroom teachers generating a 97 percent response. In addition, doctoral candidates observed interactions of principals and teachers in each school. Findings indicate that supervision and distribution of authority are processes that can enhance  teacher control. Their correlates, amenability to control and mutual adjustment, are organizatonal characteristics that contribute to a more positive and probably more productive environment. It was evident that administrators resist shared decision-making because of its apparent inconsistency with strong instructional leadership. (30 references) (SI)",

The relation between schools and a university is focused upon with a special emphasis on the relation between individuals in each institution viewed as education professionals. Three central features of CARD are first described, followed by a discussion of five major challenges it presently confronts, as it begins to wrestle with practical professionalism. CARD's five major challenges are (1) the agenda; (2) ownership; (3) professional career conflict; (4) innovation; and (5) leadership. Appended are 17 references. (SI)",

Examined next are the political challenges this creates for action researchers in universities as they seek to find an institutional structure to match their epistemology.

Education of character is determined to bridge the gap between moral judgment and moral action. This paper has five sections. First, the need for character education is examined using the example of the failure of sex education. Second, the need for character education is approached from the academic context using the weakness-of-will issue to substantiate the need. The two contemporary perspectives on moral education (espoused by Lawrence Kohlberg and Barry Chazan) are discussed. Third, it is argued that friendship and courage are necessary elements of character education. Fourth and fifth, the  development of courage and friendship is discussed. Appended are 20 references.

Seventy-six eighth graders were given a semester of instruction in a cooperative learning program that developed study skills using graphic organizers and process writing activities. An additional 34 students were given a traditional study skills class that was part of a larger, district-level competitive program. A total of 128 students completed a locus-of-control scale. Their academic grades from language arts, history, geography, study skills, mathematics, and science classes were  gathered. Of the students who were instructed in the cooperative learning study skills classes, those who were internally oriented achieved higher grades in the academic block, competitive classes. Of the students instructed in the competitive study skills classes, those who were externally oriented tended to achieve higher grades in the academic block, competitive classes. Externally oriented students tended to achieve higher grades in the first semester competitive model language arts class.

The frustration factor relates to the sense of futility felt when applying for an administrative position. The acceptance factor relates to those females who have accepted the societal stereotype that they are not worthy of administration positions. After establishing a hypothesis, a questionnaire was given to 71 undergraduate education female students from a large Northeastern university. Results indicate that the frustration and acceptance factors play a major role in deterring females from applying for school administration roles. The reluctance to consider an administration career is  related to their perception that hiring practices are biased and school boards structure their hiring practices to secure male administrators.

The sample consisted of 25 cooperating teachers primarily in grades K-8. Cooperating teachers were asked to focus their evaluations on a set of 30 teacher competency statements. Both qualitative and quantitative data were used in the analyses. Findings cited significant differences between midterm and final numerical ratings, although cooperating teachers did not focus on these ratings in their weekly narrative evaluations. In addition,  cooperating teachers' narrative comments lacked specificity and tended to provide only positive feedback. The results suggest that in the absence of well-documented observations of student teachers, cooperating teachers find it difficult to discern student teachers' professional growth.

Program data are presented to answer the following questions: What is the Austin Independent School District's gifted and talented program? What criteria were used for the identification of gifted students? How satisfactory has the identification process been? How many  students were served by the gifted and talented program? How were gifted students at the secondary level served this year? How were gifted and talented classes organized, and how often did they meet? How much did the gifted and talented program cost? Did the Office of Gifted Education meet its goals for 1985-86? Appendixes make up a major portion of the document and consist of information on the computerized student file used for program evaluation, details of the principal survey, the evaluator interview with the program coordinator, and program records.

This time period showed an uninterrupted decline in the combined number of bachelor's and master's degrees conferred. Most dramatic losses occurred in the areas of physical handicaps, mental retardation, and special learning disabilities. An increase in the number of graduates was reported in education of the gifted. The number of doctoral degrees in special education ranged from a high of 322 in 1981-82 to a low of 254 in 1984-85.

The project was developed jointly between the school district and Transitional Living Services, a local human service agency which provided funding and fulfilled state reporting requirements. The role of the special education teacher involved selecting activities, facilitating student participation in activities, setting goals, and developing activity modifications when necessary. Support staff were recruited, hired,  and trained to assist the students with disabilities. The role of the support staff was to get to know the students; to offer individualized, flexible support; and to facilitate social interactions.

People with disabilities are often separated from their families and communities, cast into roles of dependency and passivity, and kept at a social distance from other community members. Typical community members lose the chance to meet, get to know, and be with individuals with disabilities. By entering a program, people with disabilities are turned into &quot;clients.&quot; Being a client can create barriers in the development of reciprocal and nourishing relationships with others. Six characteristics have been identified that are experienced by typical people in their efforts to meet others and develop relationships, and these characteristics may not  be as available for people with disabilities. These qualities include opportunity, support, diversity, continuity, freely chosen relationships, and intimacy. A variety of accepting relationships between typical and disabled individuals is possible, and partners in such relationships report a reciprocity in their interactions that may not be apparent to the outside observer. Human services workers are encouraged to provide opportunities where people can comfortably come together to meet each other. An annotated bibliography is appended, listing six related reading items.

Strategies were developed to ensure that the men and women felt part of a home and not simply as people who were being managed by a system.

It also reports on the Medicaid-funded day program attended by the group home residents, other community activities attended by the residents, the obstacles to developing friendships with nondisabled  community members, staffing patterns, costs associated with operating the homes, and changes evident in each of the residents due to their group home experience.

The eight families, who had children with very difficult health and behavioral problems, were participants in the Macomb-Oakland Regional Center's Family Support Program, near Detroit, Michigan. Interviews were conducted to give voice to the families who were using family support, to understand their perspectives on their experiences with it, and to see its positive aspects and its dilemmas. The report examines the family situations, by looking at the conditions of the children, the parents' view of their child-rearing role, the family's acceptance of the children's handicapping conditions, leisure time activities, and foster parents' views of their work as both a job and a  responsibility to a child they grew to love. The families' perceptions of the role of the family support program are also examined. Families indicated that they wanted: an alliance between caseworkers and families; a caseworker that helps with the child but does not intrude on the family; recognition from the caseworker that parents are knowledgeable sources of information about the child; an ally with whom to transform the system; and provision of equipment, medical care, cash, and respite care.

The report is based on a site visit, which included visits to group homes, interviews with program staff, and review of program documents. Three areas of promising practices reflect the values and commitment of the staff: environments and images; appearances of daily life in working, living, and learning; and staff development and organizational supports. The staff makes efforts to normalize the home environment and the lives of the residents, and staff members are referred to as \"part-time residents,\" to minimize the connotation of a worker/client relationship. Positive reinforcement is used extensively to promote learning of functional skills  and social behavior. Residents often participate in community activities, and staff continually seek to expand the breadth of activities. Staff development involves completion of several inservice modules, each of which contains a series of objectives, readings, videotapes, and a pre/post-test.

Promising approaches that have been identified in the area of residential services for individuals with developmental disabilities include family support services, permanency planning, and individualized living alternatives for adults. Promising approaches in the mental health field also focus on family supports and permanency planning, in addition to emphasizing an  individualized, psychiatric rehabilitation approach to housing.

        "description":"The paper outlines the \"sociology of acceptance\" as a theoretical framework for understanding relationships between people with mental retardation and typical people. Sociocultural perspectives on deviance are reviewed and their contribution to the study of mental retardation is considered. The paper next examines the nature of accepting relationships and describes four sentiments expressed by typical people who form relationships with people with mental retardation: family feelings; religious commitment; humanitarian sentiments; and feelings of friendship. The article concludes with a brief discussion of the implications of a sociology of acceptance for the field of mental retardation. (Author/DB)",

First, it explores the meaning often found at the root of the often elusive definition of dual diagnosis concluding that this has become a catch-all category for people who present existing service systems with the greatest challenges. Then it examines two, often conflicting, theoretical perspectives (the holistic versus the traditional behavioral perspective) underlying the widely varied approaches to services for these people. Finally, the crucial characteristics of integrated community-based services are discussed. These include small size, choice in roommates, functional programming, individualized planning, staff availability and  flexibility, a long-term commitment, personalized service coordination, respect for autonomy and choices, individually tailored supports, flexible supports, and team support. Finally, the critical importance of forging enduring human relationships is stressed. (DB)",

The program's goal is to prevent any person 21 years of age or younger from being institutionalized. It provides respite care services, specialized family support, and integrated day care for approximately 50 persons with developmental disabilities and their families. The specialized family support component attempts to help parents obtain any service or piece of special equipment which the family sees as needed to maintain a disabled member at home. Among services provided to families are provision of respite care in either the family's or provider's home, provision of respite care at the integrated day care center, parent counseling, a  parent support group, financial support, and information referral and coordination. Cost information is provided. Agency concerns include identifying the best ways to help a family, maximizing resources, agency image problems, and maintaining flexibility. Issues identified by parents include the mother's role in families, conflicting interests, the costs of maintaining a disabled child at home, the sometimes unexpected duration of parental care responsibilities, and the lack of summer programs. Program success seems to be the result of committed leadership, philosophy, small size, commitment to integration and family life, and the parents themselves. (DB)",

Residential settings include a group home, supported apartments, foster homes, natural family homes, or independent living. The level of support offered ranges from live-in, full-time coverage, to part-time staffing, to follow-along support a few hours per week or month. The report focuses on case studies of six people supported by the program including descriptions of the physical settings and their daily routines. Key components of the program philosophy include providing residential supports to individuals in their own homes, promoting  a sense of home, promoting as much independence as possible, the belief that all people with disabilities belong in the community, and promoting an alternative to a continuum-based model of services. Program strengths include the small-scale, dispersed settings; individualized placements and supports; individualized, flexible programming in natural contexts; and staff relationships with each other and the people they support.

        "description":"The review of the literature examines issues concerned with the use of psychotropic medication by people with severe disabilities living in community settings. Data on prevalence of drug usage are provided and include that 54.3% of residents of community residences receive some type of prescribed medication, most of which are classified as psychotropic or psychoactive. A number of studies are reviewed which question the appropriateness of such massive use of medication. Additional studies have concerned behavioral toxicity, the tendency of psychotropic drugs to suppress desirable as well as problem behavior, and side effects such as tardive dyskinesia. Support for responsible use of medication stresses the role of direct service workers and the use of community physicians. It is  concluded that: (1) most people with severe disabilities do not need to be on behavior altering drugs; (2) this standard practice does not aid integration; (3) widespread use of psychotropics is probably indicative of a program which is focused on controlling groups rather than aiding the integration of individuals into the community; (4) the use of medication must be individualized; and (5) management of psychotropic medication is a generic service which people with severe disabilities can receive in the community.

Recommendations include the following: referrals to these homes by agencies should stop; agencies should review each person placed in one of these facilities and develop an alternative placement plan; agencies should develop appropriate alternatives for people who are now referred to these homes; and agencies should investigate a change in the way the State Supplemental Security Income supplement is awarded.

Attention is focused on the working-age disabled population, divided into those who are employed, those receiving public health insurance, and those neither employed nor recipients of public health insurance. Part 3 explores the limitations of acute care-oriented health insurance for meeting  such special needs as rehabilitation, maintenance therapies, personal assistance services, durable medical equipment, assistive devices, disposable medical supplies, and drugs. Part 4 identifies barriers to adequate and affordable health insurance, including medical underwriting, the cost of health care services in relation to the income of persons with disabilities, and the limitations imposed on health insurance plans because of pre-existing conditions. Part 5 examines national survey data on health care costs and utilization patterns for persons with disabilities, critiques the limitations of the data, and identifies areas for further research.

The paper summarizes current National Science Foundation (NSF) policy in regard to the development of new science and mathematics curricula and describes the work of the Duke University Talent Identification Program in its efforts to reach and foster the talent of gifted youth. NSF concerns about existing curricula are discussed, and two strategies being used by NSF are identified: (1) upgrading curricula through widespread, incremental, short-term investments, and (2) implementing radical, long-term improvements by searching for the state of the art and \"breakthroughs\" in instructional strategies. Also included is an overview of the conference presentations, highlighting the  salient points of each. Major themes of the presentations include: scientific curiosity and the integration of systems, theory and research in academic talent, educational and legislative policy in support of education for the gifted, and descriptions of programs to nurture the talent of children.

Identified concepts in the area of achieved ability include expertise, understanding, and problem-solving. Other abilities can be seen as precursors to such achieved abilities, and can offer some prediction and explanation of why those achievements came about. Candidate precursor abilities include general intelligence, multiple intelligences, the triarchic theory of intelligence, and developmental level. Implications for educational practice and research are discussed, focusing on selection of talent and instructional practice. Ruth Day offers a reaction to the paper, titled &quot;Alternative Representations: A  Key to Academic Talent?.&quot; The reaction paper describes research which found that speed and accuracy in learning can be affected by the method used to represent concepts in learning, such as two-dimensional forms of three-dimensional molecules, computer cells, and computerized text editing commands. Edward Zigler offers another view in &quot;Cognitive Theory of Academic Talent,&quot; which discusses the importance of the social and biological context of cognitive development, rate of cognitive development, creativity versus intelligence, motivation, competitiveness, etc. (JDD)",

Education legislation considered by the 100th Congress has stressed the themes of creating &quot;equity&quot; and &quot;access.&quot; The greatest emphasis has been put on education of the gifted and talented. Proposed legislation includes the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Children and Youth Education Act, Chapter 2 Block Grants, and gifted/talented education for such special groups as American Indians and Native Hawaiians. Legislation for education in mathematics, science, and technology involves Title II of the Education for Economic Security Act; Partnerships in Education for Mathematics, Science, and Engineering; the Star Schools Program Assistance  Act; Magnet Schools Assistance Act; Programs for Computer-Based Instruction; and Tests of Academic Excellence. A table presents authorization and appropriation information on programs receiving federal support. The influence of the Executive Branch of the federal government has been felt in the consolidation of categorical programs into state block grants. Thomas Berger's reaction to the paper outlines several recommendations involving federal intrusion, federal monies, textbook quality, teacher subject knowledge, etc. George Tressel's reaction comments on critical self-evaluation, flow patterns through the educational system, and curriculum concerns.

The educational support systems consist of four key initiatives: (1) a program policy statement; (2) an annual talent search and recognition process for seventh-grade students in public, independent, and parochial schools; (3) supplemental academic programs for precollegiate youth; and (4) a research agenda. Academic program support involves: coordination with regular school programs to provide credit or advanced placement, by-mail programs, an advising and  advocacy service, international initiatives, young students' classes, minority outreach and access, consultation services, student/teacher recognition and training, and a parent outreach network. A reaction to the paper by Stephanie Marshall discusses fundamental philosophical premises of talent search programs and describes the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, a 3-year residential school for gifted students.

In evaluating the current situation, the paper examines existing educational practices for students with handicaps, focusing on provisions and implementation of Public Law 94-142, funding, referral and assessment, student placement in the least restrictive environment, and program outcomes. Intermediate strategies are presented for bridging the gap between special and general education to create a unified system. These strategies include, among others, strengthening the holding power of general education and making funds  available to meet student needs, regardless of categorical labels or location of services provided. A vision of the future calls for such reforms as: viewing handicap as a social construct, recognizing various types of intelligences, framing the student's &quot;problem&quot; as a mismatch between learning needs and the instructional system, involving parents as partners, focusing on student achievement as the critical outcome, and improving educational productivity. Changes that can be accomplished within the present legislative situation are outlined. (JDD)",

        "description":"Proposals for restructuring and integration of special and general education, known as the regular education initiative (REI), represent a revolution in the basic concepts related to the education of handicapped students that have provided the foundation of special education for over a century. Education policy, as presented by Presidents Reagan and Bush, has consisted of: fostering an image of achieving excellence, regardless of substantive change; federal disengagement from education policy; and block funding of compensatory programs. All three strategies are viewed as having a negative effect on programs for special needs students. Thus, the REI is considered a flawed policy initiative which focuses on a small number of highly emotional issues such as integration, nonlabeling,  efficiency, and excellence for all. Further objections to the REI are that it does not have the support of critical constituencies, rests on illogical premises, ignores the issue of specificity in proposed reforms, and reflects a cavalier attitude toward experimentation and research. Several changes in direction are recommended for the achievement of meaningful reforms; these include obtaining the support of critical constituencies, increasing attention to the effectiveness of educational strategies rather than the place in which they are implemented, and focusing efforts on incremental improvements in the current system.

The level of proficiency attained in French by the HL students was compared to the level of proficiency attained by students enrolled in an early total French immersion program. The research questions addressed included: (1) the effect of HL literacy knowledge on third language  literacy; (2) the difference in acquisition of French language skills based on whether the HL is a Romance language; and (3) the effects of socioeconomic variables on French language proficiency. It is concluded that literacy in the HL enhances performance in third language learning. The implications of these findings as they relate to educational programs for HL children are discussed.

Two principles basic to Talent Education provided a model for the program: (1) all children are capable of being successful learners, and (2) the active participation of a family member in all stages of learning, including instruction and practice, is vital to the child's success. Because it is often difficult or impossible for parents to be present at a child's lesson, the idea of child-parent co-learning was adapted  for school use by reversing the roles of student and teacher, or by students acting as parents to other students. The FOLD workshop held in July and August 1988 for secondary school foreign language teachers supported three objectives: (1) to increase oral proficiency, (2) to provide access to recent innovative materials, and (3) to familiarize teachers with more effective classroom strategies.

Within this framework the paper addresses the following topics: (1) the major factors influencing the trends in the literature curriculum in the elementary grades within the past 30 years; (2) substantive research focusing on critical thinking about children's literature, selection  of materials for use in the teaching of critical thinking about literature, especially the critical thinking about literature as art; and (3) literature programs originating from various sources, i.e., children's literature textbooks developed in colleges, or by state departments of education, and commercial children's literature programs. The paper argues that when literature is viewed as an art, students can study literature in its truest sense, that is, engaging in critical thinking when interpreting and evaluating it.

        "description":"A study examined the attitudes of pre-service secondary teachers toward &quot;writing-to-learn&quot; before and after a compulsory course on language across the curriculum. Subjects, 90 graduates of arts, sciences, social studies, music, business, and physical education programs, recorded their attitudes and understanding of writing to learn at the start of the compulsory 6-week course, developed specific applications of writing activities for their own subject areas, and reported their change in attitudes at the end of the course. The descriptive data indicated that many students had negative or limited views on the role of writing in learning, but that they readily developed ways to incorporate writing into their teaching as the course progressed. Results also indicate that almost  without exception, the subjects planned to incorporate writing into their content area teaching. Findings support the conclusions that the subjects were convinced of the value of writing as a means of promoting learning and that some recognized the problems which might inhibit successful implementation of writing to learn.

        "description":"Richard Mitchell, the &quot;Underground Grammarian,&quot; has been dismissed by many in the academic community as a pop-culture grammar-basher. This is unfortunate, since Mitchell has linked literacy to the capacity for moral behavior. This connection between moral capacity and literacy is often avoided by the way in which literacy is defined. In western society, literacy was a prerequisite to well-being; illiteracy was symptomatic of malaise and decline. Much of the concern about literacy stems from assumptions about its consequences: cognitive, economic, and social. Yet while these consequences can be used to organize the literature on literacy, they skirt the issue of what literacy is. Literacy has to do with meaning and the pursuit of truth, neither of which reside in texts. Literacy,  then, is found in the skilled, thoughtful habits of the mind and the strengths of the heart. Just as meaning is not contained in the text on a page, literacy cannot be found in the ability to decipher those texts, but in the habits and strengths needed to create meanings and to challenge foolishness--on the page, from the lips of others, and from individuals themselves.

        "description":"Collaborative learning strategies can be especially effective in empowering first-year, culturally diverse students to integrate successfully into academic culture. Programs such as San Diego University's Intensive Learning Experience (ILE) link English and study skills instruction to specific general education courses, such as Cultural Geography or History of Western Civilization, creating a supportive learning community that bridges high school and college. Student-centered classrooms, based on cooperation and community through collaborative learning, take the inherent tensions in the academy (tensions between academic and student cultures, between teachers' roles as student advocates/collaborators and as institutional authorities/evaluators, etc.) and make them productive for  the student, teacher, and the institution itself. Collaborative learning strategies encourage students to play an active, meaningful role in their education, and present reading and writing as social as well as intellectual activities. One example of a collaborative learning activity is peer response or critique groups. Academic concepts become meaningful in interactions with student ideas and experiences through carefully designed work group and writing activities that value diverse contributions to this interaction. Students can establish supportive peer networks of students working together to negotiate difficult affective as well as cognitive transactions among the multiple communities in which they move.

        "author":["Feldman, Paula R."],
        "description":"Biographical writing is highly imaginative writing and always has been. The task of the biographer is to weave a riveting story from the fabric of the subject's life. For example, a single pivotal incident in the lives of Percy Bysshe Shelley, the English poet, and Mary Godwin, author of &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, at the grave of Mary's mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, is given wildly disparate portrayals by both contemporary and current biographers. It is the use of fictional techniques that makes a biographical subject come alive in the mind of the reader. Biographical and autobiographical writing assignments can be designed to help students discover for themselves the subjectivity involved in writing for any particular audience and writing from any particular point of view. The teacher  should encourage students to use the material of their own lives to discover how the telling of any good story, however factual, requires fictional techniques. For example, students are asked to write an account of their first date for three different audiences--their best friend, their mother, and their minister, scout leader or school principal. Or they may be asked to take out their checkbooks and imagine that in some future age they are their own biographers with only the factual information on the check stubs from which they must puzzle out and construct a life. Writing activities such as these help students better understand not only the impact of point of view and audience on writing but, where the story of a life is concerned, how much fiction is involved in both the living and  the telling.

There is a certain amount of overlap among the efforts, but their intentions are different enough to warrant separate review. The first effort is toward automatic analysis of papers. In this approach, the computer is used to fully &quot;correct&quot; or otherwise comment on papers. The second effort creates a more cooperative relationship between the computer and writer. The computer performs a series of activities that make proofreading easier for the writer, but the writer is still in charge. The computer is a tool doing the bidding of the writer. In the third approach the computer is even less  directive, and the process for revision and analysis is initiated by writers working collaboratively. The computer serves as a communication node as peers comment back and forth, reacting and revising over a period of time. Each of these approaches has evolved over time and is based on the work of people whose names and programs are generally unknown. All three approaches are still changing as the technology changes and as new ways are discovered to use effectively what the technology enables. (MM)",

        "description":"When students write syntheses in response to a rhetorical task, does the rhetorical nature of the task exert some special influence on the students' composing processes? How do these processes differ? Three case studies, quantitative analyses of papers written by seventeen undergraduates, and a tentative model of a synthesizing process address these and other questions. The case studies of three students reading a packet of eight sources and writing their papers in a read-aloud, think-aloud protocol condition, illustrate striking differences in composing process and essay quality. Differences in essay quality seem less related to the differences in composing process than to decisions the writers made about how to present the source materials to the readers. Quantitative analyses  of 17 essays showed that high quality was related to the presence of a high proportion of original ideas and not to relatively mechanical matters such as citing sources. Results suggest that synthesizing is a process of decisions which can be made in different combinations and different orders. Writers of the most successful essays in this study defined the problem as requiring original thought about the topic and sources, set rhetorical goals that required interpretation (not reproduction) of sources, and used their reading time to select source material and plan its use. Results also suggest that having a rhetorically structured task may have helped students to write better papers than they might have written without such guidelines.

        "description":"While young children's problem-solving models are not as elaborate as those of older students, they share an important belief, namely, that writing and reading are fundamentally purposeful acts of communication. Focusing on the interpretation of process, in particular on writing and reading as forms of problem-solving that are shaped by communicative purpose, three sets of vignettes show students at different stages of schooling as they write and read. The first set illustrates the nature of problem-solving in skilled reading and writing processes that are held as goals for college students. The second set of vignettes places these processes in context by considering some of the factors that influence students' problem-solving as they write and read in response to typical class  assignments. The third section explores the problem-solving skills that young students--children learning to write and read and adolescents expanding their writing and reading abilities--bring to their school assignments. It is critical that strategies such as summarization and self-questioning not become disconnected from the larger communicative, meaning-construction process. The critical question is how to sustain and further develop the potential evident in the problem-solving of young writers and readers. Flexibly structured opportunities for teachers and students to exchange views about both their own and professional texts provide the student with context for cultivating a deeper understanding of writing and reading as purposeful acts of communication and to transform the contexts  in which writing and reading occur.

        "description":"The study of literature can be a discipline only insofar as it is capable of the systemization typical of other human sciences. The possibility of system poses two directions of research: (1) exploring what conditions make system possible; and (2) discovering what follows from the fact of system's possibility. Northrop Frye followed the second possibility. More recently, Rene Girard has staked out the first: the origin of all human system--in effect, what makes the human sciences possible. By following Frye's road not taken, the promise of his democratic paideia for all verbal culture is recovered. Literature is not constituted by building blocks called archetypes, but rather &quot;minds&quot; them, as it minds all other human action, but especially imitation, the most fundamental and  potent action of all. The study of literature not only minds all rule-governed behavior, but is interested as well in the interference or feedback it produces in its novices, as well as the wish to &quot;be like&quot; other players. Finally, the infinite possibilities of all verbal culture must be reconciled to the specific historical limits and potentials of &quot;English.&quot; University and postelementary curricula are based on a canon, even while that canon is being expanded to include the voiceless. The challenge to any model for a progressive education in literature is to unite elementary and postelementary practice across this divide between good imaginative writing and cultural monuments. The answer is to insist on a distinct knowledge base of literary studies--Shakespeare's &quot;King Lear&quot; is  fundamental research in the shaping and misshaping of human solidarity.

Students need to understand what proper protocol in corporate culture involves, how it is determined by formal and informal structures, and why such protocol is important. They also need to be aware of the intricacies of official and unofficial discourse. Furthermore, if technical communication students know how complicated the informal structures and procedures of organizations can be regarding human relationships, they can proceed cautiously and fit more easily into the informal structure. As new employees, students can learn about the informal workings of the organization by observing and listening and by  participating in informal conversations about topics that are related and unrelated to work. Students should therefore know about small group dynamics, nonverbal communication, and listening techniques. Protocol also involves matters of verbal communication, including formal channels of communication. Students should be aware of these channels, and should also determine the informal channels of communication that develop in the work setting. Proper protocol becomes the rhetoric of the upward bound--the rhetoric of those students who will advance in their profession. (MM)",

The purpose of the survey was to gain a sense of the extent to which courses integrate speaking and writing (where speech is valued not merely as a convenience for conducting classroom business, but as a medium for cultivating the cognitive, social, and aesthetic qualities that engender good writing); to gather sample syllabi and course materials; and to identify some of the obstacles which program administrators perceive in developing such curricula. Surveys were mailed to 498 college-level writing program administrators; the response rate was 44%. Forty percent of respondents indicated that their institutions offered courses in which at least 10% of  instructional time was devoted to speaking and writing activities integrated in a deliberate, theory-based manner. Another 45% reported no such courses. The most frequent type of speaking-writing activity reported was &quot;group discussion for invention or revision,&quot; followed by &quot;oral presentations that also involve a writing assignment.&quot; Other common responses included peer tutorials, interviews, and reading essays aloud.

As sensitivity to the role of context in the social construction of knowledge increases, ethnography is viewed as a particularly relevant approach for research in schools and classrooms. The participant observer, who is both a member of the group and, simultaneously, its researcher, is considered the most important instrument in ethnography. The ethnographer's integrity is the most important researcher trait. As an insider, the teacher/ethnographer sees, hears, and learns more about the community than an outsider would. But, ironically, being an insider may impose constraints on the ethnographer that jeopardize the integrity of the final document. There  is no room to equivocate. In order for the teacher/ethnographer to stay in control of the final written product, it may not always be wise to remain at the school. Staying on may present a difficult choice: to face unpleasant repercussions from alienated colleagues and administrators or to write a document that falls short of presenting an honest portrait made up of the study's findings.

The TSA Technique overcomes the inadequacies of earlier methods of analyzing classroom language by (1) studying dialogue rather than teacher monologue: (2) eliminating the need for specifically prepared transcripts; and (3) accounting for the context of words, an element left out of other computerized analyses. The steps in using TSA Technique are: (1) divide the dialogue into cycles; (2) select substantive words; (4) produce a  correlation matrix; (5) factor analyze the matrix; (6) cross-correlate the factor scores with a lag of 1; and (7) draw diagrams of both the distribution and relationship of themes across cycles and among the themes themselves.

The &quot;Course&quot; covers three main topics: traditional rhetorical arts of invention, arrangement, and style. Borrowing from the ideas of David Hartley, the association psychologist; Joseph Addison, the aesthetician; and Adam Smith, the moralist--all of whom offer Priestley a psychology of the human mind, Priestley contributed to discussions of style in 18th century rhetoric by synthesizing and expanding upon the thought of the best thinkers of his day and by using Lockean associationism to explain stylistic effects. Priestley's rhetoric is one of the most successful attempts to base a theory of style on association psychology. By doing so, Priestley rejected the  classical concepts of high, middle, and low style and replaced them with a theory that emphasized the psychological impact language can have on readers and listeners. Language becomes the medium through which an individual mind can communicate with another, and style becomes the group of techniques writers and speakers use to gain assent, which Priestley conceived of as a psychological process.

        "description":"Every day, observations and predictions are made about people's gender on the basis of their communicative behaviors and the roles individuals play in their culture. Although interest in the relationship between biological sex and communication may be traced to the beginning of this century, much of the research on gender and communication has been produced over the past 15 years. Examining the history of gender and communication reveals how these topics are related. Communication is related to gender because communication identifies roles and encourages or discourages the internalizing of predispositions that relate to masculinity and femininity. Gender also relates to communication because it influences the specific use of verbal and nonverbal codes, languages of the masculine  and feminine subcultures. Two major problems account for the difficulty in effective and appropriate communication across these subcultures: (1) it is assumed that gender and sex are synonyms; and (2) perceptions of behavior are often confused with actual behavior. The dilemmas in this area can be solved if people are willing to separate their perceptions of themselves or of others from the behaviors that they or others exhibit, and if gender and sex are viewed as distinctive constructs. Sex refers to biological differences between people; gender refers to internalized predispositions about masculine and feminine roles. (Twenty-two references are attached.) (MM)",

This essay accordingly surveys current thinking in America and in the British Commonwealth countries on the crisis in the theoretical foundations of educational administration. Topics include a critique and reformulation of the notion of leadership, a cultural perspective on the work of schools, the problem of school evaluation, the economics of schooling, and the administration of gender in education. The essay concludes by delineating  the premises of a new theory of educational administration being developed at Deakin University in Australia, based on neo-Marxian critical theory: the notion that educational administration is socially constructed and that organizational structures serve to reproduce the existing unequal social order.

In 1984 a school district in New Hampshire instituted a Performance Based Salary Program (PBSP). This paper addresses the following research question: What effect has the PBSP had upon the quality of the work environment for teachers? Survey results were focused on several areas: (1) background; (2) attitudes toward teaching; (3) attitudes toward PBSP; (4) impact of the PBSP; (5) teachers' self-reported performance ratings; (6) teacher evaluation; (7) job burnout; (8) teacher job satisfaction; and (9) recommendations. Followup interviews were conducted with randomly selected  teachers (N=18), administrators (N=9) and board members (N=5). Success of PBSP has contributed to teachers' personal growth as well as improved student learning. Upon analysis of the study, it is clear that teachers believe that PBSP has led to improvement in the following areas: principal involvement, staff development, classroom instruction, education quality, financial support and community confidence. Teachers believe conditions have deteriorated as a result of PBSP in the following area: principal/teacher communications; cooperation among teachers; and teacher/administrator trust.

This report consists of four essays that reflect the thinking of teachers and administrators at the time of the discussions. In the first essay, seminar participants view the school in a social context and grapple with the problems of role and responsibility. Participants were concerned about the duality of roles: protecting the academic mission and serving the social needs of students.  The second essay confronts &quot;head-on&quot; the disjuncture between what students are taught and what they come to discover about the world. A detailed design is presented for an innovative school to meet the needs of the learner in the 1990's. The third essay addresses the issues involved in restructuring for that &quot;ideal&quot; school: empowerment, defining a mission, organizational structure, and allowing both students and teachers to reach their potential. The final essay returns to a socially contextual topic: the balance between local control and maintaining state standards of excellence. (TE)",

This manual is designed to provide a brief overview of the law relating to public employee strikes and to assist districts in adopting their own strike plans. It offers suggestions regarding the delegation of responsibilities during a strike and provides checklists that can be used by administrators to help ensure that all critical tasks have been completed. Chapter I is a review of basic legal issues presented by strikes. Chapters II through IX outline the roles and responsibilities of members of the strike team and school principals charged with the difficult task of ensuring that the district continues  to provide essential services during the pendency of a strike with the least possible disruption. Chapter X outlines poststrike procedures to help bring the district back to normal. The chapters are followed by appendices containing checklists, questionnaires, agendas, news releases, and similar materials designed to facilitate the role of the administrator during a strike.

The thesis is that a radical reform movement in the profession of educational administration is essential to the survival of the profession. Accordingly, the present condition of educational administration is analyzed, and several proposals are offered to improve the condition. These include: developing a bifurcated program in which administrators, professors, and researchers take their theoretical work together and then move into either a program for administrators or a program for professors and researchers; recruiting graduate students in educational administration from teachers with a demonstrated capacity for  leadership; and sharing the responsibility for preparing administrators with the public schools. Next, five \"strands\" of a reformed educational administration curriculum are delineated: (1) the theoretical study of administration; (2) the technical core of educational administration; (3) solution of problems through applied research and the development of administrative skills; (4) involvement in supervised practice; and (5) demonstration of competence. The paper concludes with a summarized series of recommendations for upgrading the professional status of educational administration. (TE)",

        "description":"American educational policy is based on three preeminent values: equity, efficiency, and choice. The problem is that these values are often antithetical: an emphasis on one deemphasizes the others. Coming to an acceptable balance among all three values is therefore the essence of public policymaking. Accordingly, this paper takes one of these pairs--efficiency and choice--and discusses how they have been defined, how they act sometimes in harmony and sometimes in opposition, and how the interaction between them can be used to explain instances of policymaking. First, the conventional dictionary definitions of efficiency and choice are reviewed. Second, common uses of the terms are discussed, and changes in meaning over time are reviewed, specifically as these terms are used in an  educational context. A discussion ensues of ways of speaking about efficiency and choice in a policymaking context. Finally, the two values are used as explanatory concepts to describe and analyze a specific instance of federal educational policy formation: the adoption and implementation of the Federal Education Block Grant. References are included. (TE)",

        "description":"Since 1979, education has had a key role in promoting social change in Nicaragua. Toward that end, the education system is expected to contribute to: (1) the formation of a &quot;new person,&quot; a more critically conscious and participatory citizen who is motivated by collective goals; and (2) the transmission of the skills and knowledge to overcome decades of underdevelopment and set the nation on the path of self-sustaining growth. This paper is a survey of education in Nicaragua before and after the revolution that overthrew the Somoza dynasty in 1979. During the Somoza period, half the nation was illiterate with more than three-fourths of rural populations unable to read or write. Like most Latin American countries, Nicaragua under Somoza provided extensive education at public  expense to urban elites, but failed to provide more minimal primary education or even basic literacy to a majority of its citizens. The new regime, despite setbacks, constraints, and challenges posed by intensified external aggression against the Sandinista regime, has nevertheless carried out a successful national literacy crusade and a followup program of popular education for newly literate adults and youths. It still remains to be seen, however, whether the newly acquired skills and knowledge will contribute substantially to increasing economic productivity, better health, more adequate housing, and effective communal action. The reconstruction of the Nicaraguan education system is only beginning. (TE)",

The results were derived from a survey of 745 government school students, 380 Catholic school students, and 365 independent school students in 50 Melbourne, Australia schools. The survey had response rate of 90 percent. Correlations were drawn from scores based on instruments that tested students'&quot;surface approach&quot; to learning, which involves unreflective rote memorization, and &quot;deep approach&quot; to learning, which involves interpreting relationships between parts of subject matter; also scored were students' perceptions of teaching effectiveness.  ANOVA was used to measure the association between student perceptions of their &quot;surface&quot; or &quot;deep&quot; learning strategies and their formal achievement as evaluated by standardized end-of-year subject examination results. Findings demonstrated that students who reported &quot;deep&quot; strategies to learning perceived the teaching in the schools they attended to be better than those students who reported &quot;surface&quot; strategies. Although &quot;surface&quot; students scored lower on the end-of-year examination than the &quot;deep&quot; students, the low correlation between the deep approach and formal achievement did not suggest which school learning environment was more desirable or which learning strategies augmented achievement.

Sixty-three percent or 82 out of 154 of these principals participated. Interpretative categories were gleaned from the principals' responses to a survey. The findings demonstrated that teachers who dedicate themselves to the academic and personal success of their students; work hard with students to  build a feeling of unity and belonging; involve parents; and foster participative planning among students, parents, and administrators, belong to the most effective teams. Furthermore, administrators who vigorously instigate and prolong these teams actually promote their effectiveness.

Discussion focused on the training model and the means used to measure the effects of inservice training on teacher attitudes toward a writing process model. Using instruments from the Concerns Based Adoption Model (CBAM), the researcher evaluated the degree of implementation of the writing innovation and the nature of teacher concerns during implementation as recorded by teachers who participated in the study. Twelve volunteer teacher pairs were randomly assigned to treatment groups and to comparison groups which received peer coaching training for 14 weeks. However, only the the treatment group teachers were formally trained in the observation cycle--a 5-step teaching of writing  sequence that included presenting, composing, revising, editing, and publishing. Descriptive statistics, ANOVA, and chi square tests were used to measure teacher implementation of writing process strategies and teacher concerns about the new teaching model during one school year. Findings demonstrated that inservice peer coaching maximizes participant learning, implementation of curriculum content, and teacher comfort with the new curriculum. The treatment group teachers demonstrated more proficient implementation of the writing process strategies in terms of quality and quantity than the comparison group. (JAM)",

        "description":"Although there is controversy as to whether middle-level education should be more comparable to high school or to elementary school, this paper argues that the school within a school (SWAS) concept effectively makes large schools seem small so that they have more in common with a typical K-5 school than with a grade-10-through-12 high school. The advantages of such an arrangement permit medium-sized and large middle schools to divide into smaller subunits called &quot;houses.&quot; The house plan tends to personalize teaching and learning. Students may leave the house for specialized subjects such as music, foreign language, science, health, and physical education. Evidence suggests that SWAS and minischool programs have been shown to produce significant achievement growth; to improve  attendance and behavior; and to generate student, staff, and parent satisfaction. The report concludes by arguing that middle school policymakers should give house plans and small schools within big schools a chance. Appended are five pages of references. (JAM)",

Traditional health/sex education programs and those facilitating parent-adolescent communication are inadequate. Information alone, without access to a range of medical services, cannot prevent pregnancy among sexually active adolescents, help already pregnant young women, provide support for students facing ready access to illicit drugs, or help youth understand the importance of proper nutrition. A link between the schools and medical providers seems an optimal solution. More than 70 U.S. schools have established health clinics to meet adolescents' special health needs. Since 1983, school-based clinics have been established in the Kansas City (Missouri) School District. This paper describes a  project to evaluate these clinics' effectiveness and to monitor student health and life habits in area high schools with and without clinics. Between 1982 and 1987, 4,410 students were surveyed regarding their health and living habits, homelife characteristics, and future plans, using the High School Health Questionnaire. The students attended one of four high schools, three of which had school-based health clinics. In general, the clinics had successfully carried out their program objectives. Implications for improving health clinic evaluations are also discussed. Included are 11 tables and three references. (MLH)",

The first section is an overview of a larger study that sought to determine if the improvement of management practices of supervisees is associated with conferencing (principal-led intervention) or with research-verified knowledge about classroom management taught by supervisors trained in conferencing techniques (a &quot;common language&quot; approach). The second and third sections present case studies of each dyad. The first dyad is composed of a high conceptual level (CL) principal interacting with a low CL teacher; the second, of a low CL principal interacting with a low CL teacher. The  fourth section compares the two different dyads in terms of the conferencing strategies used by the high and low CL principals, and in terms of the associated effects that were evident in the teacher's classroom management practices. The final section offers some concluding observations about the nature of the dyadic interactions. Findings revealed that a teacher's conceptual level and the role that the teacher's responses play in the dynamic of conference interaction, the principal's knowledge of pertinent content (in the case of this study, classroom management), the principal's ability (or lack thereof) to observe classroom events accurately, the principal's ability to transform a facilitating approach into an enabling one, and certain aspects of organizational life that act as  constraints on both principal and teacher enhance or inhibit the teacher's classroom management processes.

The paper examines the interactive responses of high- and low-conceptual-level teachers in four different supervisory dyads as they conference with their principals in an attempt to ascertain whether their dyadic interaction is associated in any way with the outcomes of the conference. The first dyad is composed of a high-conceptual-level (CL) teacher interacting with a low-CL principal; the second, of a high-CL teacher interacting with a moderate-CL principal; the third, of a low-CL teacher interacting with a high-CL principal; and the fourth, of a low-CL teacher interacting with a low-CL principal. The larger study  ascertained whether effective clinical supervision requires high-conceptual-level principals who practice particular process strategies as they conference with teachers, or whether the mere acquisition of researched-based content knowledge is sufficient to effect improvement in teachers' classroom management performance. Case study observational techniques comprised the research methodology. Findings suggest that the conditions necessary to produce a successful classroom management outcome require principals and teachers to find a common language through which to communicate based upon an appropriate match between high- and low-conceptual-level principals and teachers.

        "description":"This paper discusses homework policy as a product of 50 years of experimental research. Part 1 discusses homework guidelines in grades 3 through 8 by suggesting that homework should be assigned, graded, and individualized. In addition, homework should provide feedback about student achievement that includes parental monitoring. Part 2 recommends secondary school homework policies that include clear and concise graded assignments. Furthermore, the proposal that some homework be guided, voluntary, and nonwritten reflects outcomes of homework research in American education. The conclusion that the assigning of homework should follow a regular pattern aligned with classroom subject matter supports the notion that homework reinforces learning, thereby raising student achievement.  Moreover, school districts should support homework policies that research findings link to raising student achievement. (JAM)",

        "description":"This paper provides a conceptual framework for addressing the issue of effectiveness and efficiency in education. It considers alternative criteria for identifying efficiency and discusses constraints on improving efficiency. The first section distinguishes efficiency from effectiveness, and also distinguishes \"internal\" from \"external\" efficiency and effectiveness. The inputs of the system determine whether the term \"efficiency\" or \"effectiveness\" is to be used; the outputs determine whether the descriptors \"internal\" or \"external\" are applied. In most cases, nonmonetary inputs imply effectiveness, while monetary inputs imply efficiency; similarly, nonmonetary outputs imply internality and monetary outputs imply externality. Three issues are indirectly related to the measurement  of effectiveness and efficiency: the broader consequences of education, equity considerations, and specification of qualitative versus quantitative outputs. Constraints on improving efficiency include inadequate knowledge about internal effectiveness, inadequate knowledge about costs of inputs, and difficulty in obtaining appropriate information.

Data were collected through examination of student files and interviews with school personnel at nine sites, representing approximately 15% of the local education agencies in the state. It was found that state guidelines were generally followed and evaluations were comprehensive and appropriate. Observations, however, were generally inadequate and diagnostic  testing for educational planning was minimal for LD and BD students. Wide variability was found in implementation of preassessment. Three critical factors differentiated successful from unsuccessful preassessment implementations: (1) accurately describing the student's problem, (2) using direct, appropriate interventions, and (3) evaluating the outcome of the interventions. Districts where preassessment was effectively implemented had a much lower rate of referral to comprehensive evaluation than districts with less successful preassessment. (DB)",

A textbook analysis tool was developed, and eight teacher-reviewers examined the instructional design of teachers' and students' editions of 12 leading elementary and secondary science and social studies textbook programs. Forty additional teachers were then asked to verify the reviewers' findings. Recommendations for publishers are organized within the three phases of the learning cycle: getting students ready to learn, engaging students in the learning activity, and having students demonstrate competence and extend knowledge. For each of the three phases of instruction, the report summarizes the  findings of the textbook analysis by content area and grade level. The primary finding of the analysis was that textbooks failed to incorporate effective methods of instruction, particularly at the secondary level. Publishers are urged to build in activities that set the stage for reading, make students active participants in learning, teach students how to use reading and self-monitoring strategies, and provide numerous opportunities to demonstrate mastery in a variety of ways. The report concludes with appended sample activities for teachers to make better use of existing textbooks, as well as a list of the 12 textbooks analyzed and lists of references and readings.

The emphasis is on thinking and writing as an interrelated process which involves both skill and conceptual development. Students practice standard grammar, mechanical skills, and sentence, paragraph, and essay structure and development. Students are also challenged to expand their ability to think creatively and logically, and to begin to develop their own original voice and style.  Classtime is comprised of discussions of student and professional essays, skill exercises, short creative writing assignments, and thinking games. Students write personal, nonfiction compositions and prepare for classwork at home. Writing workshops are designed to develop students' critical reading and writing skills, by having the class actively discuss and critique student essays. The curriculum guide contains an annotated bibliography of recommended texts, a sample reading list, sample assignments, sample exercises, and samples of student writing projects. (JDD)",

Scientific and social progress toward prevention has pursued a wavelike, erratic course, driven primarily by prevailing social, political, and economic climates and values. The new morbidity model of mental retardation focuses on mental retardation as a symptom or an outcome of underlying biological and social causes. Two primary associates of subsequent morbidity are poverty and low birthweight. Prenatal care is a major factor in improving pregnancy outcome and lowering incidence of low birthweight and prematurity. Access to basic services should be assured,  including: prenatal, delivery, and postnatal care; comprehensive care through age 5; and family planning services. Another health problem which is impacted by socioeconomic disadvantage is pediatric acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Problems associated with the new morbidity have human and economic costs which far outweigh the costs of investing time and resources in research, treatment, and prevention. (JDD)",

        "description":"A peer coaching approach was developed for use in the Multidisciplinary Diagnostic and Training Program (MDTP) at the University of Florida, in collaboration with Old Dominion University in Virginia. The MDTP provides diagnostic services to elementary-aged children with learning, behavior, and/or medical problems. The peer coaching model includes the three stages of planning/discussion, observation, and feedback. Teacher trainees shadow the MDTP teachers and learn the techniques of observation and coaching/feedback first hand; trainees are also placed in the role of teacher and coached in the same manner as the MDTP teachers. Teacher behaviors are observed and recorded, observations are tallied and reliability is calculated, and a coaching/feedback session is conducted. After  review of the observational data, the teacher selects one behavior to increase or decrease in frequency. Peer coaching has been found to be an effective method for improving the training of preservice teaching personnel and enhancing the professional competence of classroom teachers. By reviewing their own teaching techniques and exploring alternatives in a nonjudgmental atmosphere, teachers and trainees have an opportunity to reflect on their teaching, experience feedback, and formulate hypotheses about the process and outcome of their instructional endeavors.

The 1986-87 program emphasized teacher training, consisting primarily of in-class support, consultation, and workshops. Students received special education services based on Individual Education Plans (IEP) that took into consideration their skills and abilities. The program's stated evaluation objective was that 75 percent of students whose teachers were assisted by the program would achieve their IEP objectives in the subjects in which their teachers received instructional support. During the 1986-87 school year, in  which 201 students enrolled in 75 high schools received services from participating teachers, 81 percent of the students met all of their IEP objectives. Interviews with a sample of supported teachers and assistant principals indicated that the assistance which teacher trainers provided was viewed positively.

A series of studies was initiated to determine whether special administrations of such tests are comparable to standard administrations, in which case flagging would no longer be necessary. The studies looked at comparability data for test takers with hearing impairments, visual impairments, physical handicaps, and learning disabilities. Comparability between standard and nonstandard test forms was found to be high, particularly with respect to characteristics as reliability, factor structure, and differential item difficulty. Analysis of the tests'  predictive validity with regard to academic performance found that there was little over- or under-prediction for the great majority of handicapped students. The SAT did, however, substantially overpredict college performance for learning-disabled students, and this overprediction was exacerbated by time extensions during test administrations. The need for flagging test scores may be eliminated by establishing comparable timing criteria for special test administrations or by rescaling nonstandard test administrations according to how handicapped students performed in school. The comparability study also examined admissions decisions, test content, and testing accommodations. (JDD)",

A working definition of technology dependence is provided and the prevalence of technology dependence among American children is estimated. Analysis shows that the population of technology-dependent children has increased in size over the past 25 years, and it will probably continue to increase for several more. A principal finding is that the size of the population varies dramatically with the clinical criteria used in the definition. Examination of the relative effectiveness and costs of home versus hospital care found that the cost-saving potential of home care depends to a great extent on attributes of the family and the home environment. Payment for  nonhospital care is hindered by lack of coverage and poor coordination between private and public payers. Virtually all very-long-term technology-dependent children requiring a high level of nursing assistance will exceed the limits of their families' private insurance policies and will end up on Medicaid.

Following behavioral assessments, planning for behavior management intervention includes general suggestions for handling incidents (e.g., maintain composure, start each day with a clean slate). Among suggestions for preventive planning are selection of clothing and accessories  that permit rapid, unencumbered movement, wearing short hair, and keeping items of high personal value away from the bus. Strategies for behavior management, including suggested bus rules for students, are outlined, and steps in the implementation of the behavior management plan (verbal warning, change of seating assignment, written report) are described.

The second section reports the preliminary findings of each of the 17 studies. In addition the following cross study issues are considered: intervention with medically fragile infants and young children; comparison of parent-infant interaction coding systems; assessment of family functioning; family characteristics, family type, and stress in  families with children who are handicapped; relationship of demographic and family functioning variables to parent involvement; measurement of parent involvement; costs of early intervention; and evaluation of the usefulness of the Battelle Developmental Inventory for making special education eligibility and placement decisions. The final chapter describes the Early Intervention Program Inventory, a data base intended to facilitate the comparison of results of program evaluations. Briefly noted are reports on the advisory committee, the graduate student training component, and dissemination activities.

The examination of state policy documents included both an analysis of regulatory language and implementation procedures. State adherence to Public Law 94-142 Protection in Evaluation Procedures (PEP) and the development of additional state procedures to ensure non-bias in the identification process were also reviewed. Results are presented in tabular form by state for such areas as: statement of nondiscriminatory evaluation intent, preplacement evaluation, evaluation procedures, administration of evaluation instruments in child's native language or communication mode, validity of measure for purpose used, administration by trained personnel, care that  test measures ability rather than impaired skills, use of multiple criteria for program eligibility, evaluation by multidisciplinary team, and assessment in all areas related to suspected disability.

Interviews and observations were conducted of 30 learning disabled (LD), 32 emotionally-behaviorally disturbed (EBD), and 30 educable mentally retarded (EMR) students in grades 2-4. Instruction was evaluated in terms of six instructional clusters based on principles of effective instruction: (1) instructional planning, (2) instructional presentation, (3) checking for student understanding, (4) task relevance, (5) practice, and (6) feedback. In general, the average ratings on the instructional clusters were high for all groups. Quality of instruction was very similar for LD and EBD groups. Instruction of EMR students, however, was rated  lower on checking for student understanding, instructional presentation, and task relevance. The study raises questions concerning the value of classifying students and suggests more emphasis on monitoring the effectiveness of instruction for each student's progress. (DB)",

Overall the average student-teacher ratio was 4.7:1 with a range of 1:1 to 15:1. Minor differences were found as a result of the students' categorical designations (learning disabled, emotionally/behaviorally disordered, mentally retarded, and speech impaired) and the elementary vs secondary distinction. The most frequently identified basis for selecting students for instructional groupings, regardless of category, was the student's level of academic performance, followed by standardized psychological test scores, and student  learning styles matched with teaching methods. The survey also found that teachers were generally unfamiliar with their local district guidelines for student-teacher ratios and caseloads. The survey form, list of criteria for selection of teachers for the survey, and criteria for responses on methods of grouping are appended. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"In spite of the growing awareness and development of respite services, many families in need of them have little or no access. This is especially true for families whose children have emotional handicaps. A rationale for respite services supports parents' entitlement to respite care, its importance to all family members, and its help in improving family effectiveness. Respite services consist of in-home care, which may include homemaker, sitter/companion, and parent trainer services; and out-of-home care, which encompasses care in the provider's home, foster care or licensed family care, group day care, group home residential care, respite care provided by residential treatment facilities, crisis nurseries and emergency respite care facilities, and community services providing  respite care as a secondary purpose. Attributes and training required for respite providers are outlined. Public policies have restricted development of respite care, by creating: eligibility criteria which exclude many families, inconsistencies in funding, and other conditions of service. Efforts are being made at many levels, from local advocacy groups to federal legislation, to bring respite care into the service delivery system. The report concludes with a list of 59 references, containing both published and organizational sources. (JDD)",

The report addresses two questions: How are youth with disabilities doing in their transition to adulthood? and What factors appear to have helped or hindered them in making a successful transition? Among findings on the secondary school stage of transition are that 56% of special education exiters left secondary school by graduating; that 8% of special education exiters left school because they exceeded the school age limit; and that the dropout rate for youth with emotional disturbances was almost 55%. Findings for the postsecondary transition stage indicated that fewer than 15%  of special education exiters had participated in postsecondary education the previous year; and that less than half of the out-of-school youth had found either part or fulltime paid employment. Factors related to school failure or dropping out included age (younger students were more likely to fail), male sex, minority status, an identified emotional disturbance, poor social integration, previous disciplinary problems, and frequent school absences. Extensive tables provide detailed statistical data. An appendix gives an overview of the study as well as definitions of independent variables used in the multivariate analyses. (DB)",

Findings for the first question are discussed in terms of the nature and size of the schools attended, participation in special education, involvement in regular education courses, enrollment in vocational education courses, and the nature of additional services provided by the schools and others. Data on academic  achievement included: whether students in graded programs received a failing grade in the most recent year, whether students in graded programs were promoted to the next grade level, whether students passed minimum competency tests, and whether youth completed secondary school by graduating, dropping out, or exceeding the school age limit.

The first section compares the secondary special education population to the nonhandicapped student population noting such differences as increased numbers of males, single parent backgrounds, and tendency to stay in high school longer for the disabled population. The next section describes the incidence of and reasons for dropping out among youth with disabilities. The graduation rates for youth with orthopedic, visual, or hearing impairments approach the  rate for nondisabled students, while graduation rates for youth with emotional disturbances, mental retardation, or multiple handicaps are below 50%. Dropout reasons are similar to those for nondisabled students--not liking school, not doing well in school, and behavior problems in school. No significant school characteristics were found to relate to incidence of dropping out in this population.

Since what is taught in secondary schools in Japan depends heavily on the textbook used, it is useful to find out what and how much about American culture is being included in the textbook used. A review of seven studies of textbooks used in Japanese secondary schools reveals the conclusion that American culture is not addressed extensively in any textbook series. In addition, the textbooks do not exploit some of the material available in the textbooks, such as covert culture in illustrations or vocabulary that have a cultural meaning different from the same vocabulary in Japanese.

Results indicated that newly-arrived Japanese had difficulty in a number of these areas. For example, while the students understood American coins and bills, they were unfamiliar with checking accounts, writing checks, or the average cost of a meal or a hotel room. Although students knew what clothing to wear for business and school occasions, they had problems knowing what kinds of clothing to wear for social occasions due to  limited knowledge of the levels of formality in social situations. It is concluded that Japanese students need more cultural preparation before coming to the United States. (Author/MSE)",

Researchers investigating the nature-nurture controversy, the order of acquisition, and other linguistic features find the twin situation particularly interesting because of the children's shared genetic makeup and environment. A substantial amount of relevant literature is available. Review of this material and analysis of the language samples of a set of fraternal twins give insight into the language development process and reinforce the concept of individual differences in language use and acquisition. Samples of the 3-year-old twins' language used in free conversation, event representations, bedtime routine, parent-child interaction, and child-babysitter  interaction were examined for linguistic characteristics, differences, and similarities. Results suggest strongly that individual preferences and personalities shape linguistic performance, and that the children's abilities reinforce the influence of environment on language development. It is concluded that the twin situation is an example of language variation within a single household, in which the linguistic support offered a child must complement his perceptions if abilities are to be developed fully. It also illustrated that parental support for twins during difficult stages is challenging. (MSE)",

        "description":"The one-parameter psychometric model known as the Rasch model is described and examined. The basic principles underlying the model and the concepts of unidimensionality, local stochastic independence, and additivity are explained in non-mathematical terms. The requirements of measurement procedures, the measurement of latent traits, the control on model fit, and the definition of a trait are discussed. It is argued that the Rasch model is particularly appropriate to understand the mutual dependence of test reliability and validity. Examples from French native language and English foreign language listening comprehension tests are used to illustrate the application of the model to a test validation procedure. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"A discussion of the field of contrastive linguistics (CL) begins by defining the relationship between theoretical and applied CL in terms of the concept of finalization, which originated in the philosophy of science. Then, the historical development of CL in the United States and Europe is sketched. This development is seen as characterized by a reorientation from structure-centered to process-centered analysis. Research conducted in the following areas is considered to have contributed to this change: inter- and intralingual errors, language universals, interlanguage, transfer and cognition, and discourse. It is suggested that this reorientation has helped to reduce the contrast between the two domains of theoretical and applied CL and corresponds to the shift in focus from  language structure to language use in general linguistics. Sociosemiotics is proposed as a methodological and theoretical framework for CL, with social interaction across cultures as the central object in CL. This object is described on the basis of underlying cognitive processes and is explained in semiotic terms. A reference list of 127 items is appended. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"A study of the discourse of Ga'dang, a Philippine language, focuses on normative discourse and persuasion, especially the ways in which the former is used to accomplish the latter. The first five chapters outline the theoretical framework of the study, placing normative and persuasive discourse in a philosophical context and relating them to the fields of cognitive science, to neuropsychology, and to the study of the consequences of literacy to provide an explanation for the substantial differences between Ga'dang normative discourse and that of Western society. The conciliatory nature of dispute settlement in Ga'dang is examined in relation to the sociology or ethnology of law and social control. The normative discourse of dispute settlement is seen as intended to produce group  harmony and consensus. Subsequent chapters narrow the focus on normative discourse to those elements central to discourse analysis, and particularly to a distinct type of normative discourse in Ga'dang, informal litigation. The textual characteristics of a substantial portion of one litigation (appended) are identified, and the strategies of persuasion used are discussed. A scale of normativity is used to rank the features of Ga'dang normative discourse, and the results are analyzed. (MSE)",

Subjects were students enrolled in an intensive college summer language program in French and Spanish. Results suggest a positive relationship between listening ability and overall FL ability, FL listening comprehension skills, and FL oral skills.

        "description":"When intermediate and advanced students of English as a second language (ESL) begin an English composition course, they face the task of creating logical extended discourses in English. Often, while the sentences they create are free from obvious grammatical errors, they are stylistically unacceptable, vague in meaning, misrepresentative of the message, or occasionally incomprehensible. To help the student effectively, the instructor must understand what causes un-English sentences. A useful approach is interlanguage analysis, in which errors are viewed as a sign of the learners' attempts to approximate the target language norm. These attempts are influenced by a number of factors such as exposure to comprehensible input, language transfer, and overgeneralization. In individual  student conferences, the teacher can use interlanguage analysis to point out the ways in which errors indicate progress, to encourage the student to talk about the writing, and to locate possible causes of the errors. Based on the information gained, the teacher can better decide what strategy to use in helping the student. (MSE)",

Subjects were nine students from six countries enrolled in two university ESL writing classes. The primary writing activity was personal journal writing that required description and examination of the students' past experiences. Data were drawn from two questionnaires, notes and audiotapes of classroom observations, teacher and student interviews, and teacher and student journal writing. Writing samples were analyzed for five features: functions (representational and reflective), content, audience, organizational form, and linguistic form. Although the subjects were treated as case studies, writing samples were compared for different treatments or  combinations of the five features. Overall, the findings indicated that individual differences such as past writing experience and personality had a greater influence than cultural background on students' approaches to the journal writing task. Teachers are cautioned against over-reliance on cultural values and customs to explain student behavior and learning. (Author/MSE)",

This analysis suggests a different picture of the preference structure than that proposed by other researchers in that this analysis (1) accepts other-correction by a more competent or knowledgeable speaker as a normal response to certain conversational circumstances, (2) views the relationship between interlocutors and their conversational goals as primary rather  than centered in turn-taking and preference structures, and (3) recognizes distribution of knowledge as the fundamental factor determining the preference structure of repair in any given interaction.

A second concept, intersubjectivity, concerns the nature of the Japanese scientists' interdependence in lexical usage, which can be used by the dictionary editors when eliding portions or trimming the lexical examples. Finally, when dictionary users seek words, they seek control, a third Vygotskyan concept divided into object-, other-, and self-regulation. In addition, a psycholinguistic shift for  dictionary users from intra- to interpsychological planes is hypothesized. (Author/MSE)",

Statistical analysis of the results consistently showed significant main effects for ability, an interaction effect between pausing and ability in two instances, and no significant effects involving speed.

Developers soon realized that, to apply the generic guidelines to the construction of proficiency descriptions for a particular LCTL, the target language itself must be assessed, and that such factors as cultural context, appropriate content, sociolinguistic peculiarities, and measurements of accuracy must be considered for each language. The guidelines developed for Arabic and  Indonesian illustrate the necessary considerations. Training language-specific testers provided another area of difficulty in assessing proficiency levels for the LCTLs. Possible solutions to this problem include the following: (1) training through English or through another language with which the tester is familiar; (2) training in a language structurally similar to the target language; (3) pairing the tester with a native speaker of the target language; and (4) utilizing semi-direct tests. Issues in the area of interrater reliability have been called to attention, and the recent legislation and regulations for proficiency testing and competency-based language programs has created several policy questions that funding agencies and post-secondary institutions must face.

Results included the following: (1) all faculty devoted most of their time to teaching-related activities; (2) faculty seem to have considerable autonomy in their teaching duties, in that the teaching activity they most prefer is the one in which they spend  the most time; (3) performance faculty would like to devote more time to performance, while theorists-historians and music educators would rather not perform at all; (4) all three faculty types would like to devote more time to research-related activities; (5) music educators and performers devote a great deal of time to administrative and committee work and would rather not, while theorists-historians are only marginally involved in such duties and like that lack of involvement; and (6) performers and music educators work 8 to 10 hours more per week than theorists-historians. It is felt that these results show great differences in the amount of autonomy of music faculty and that these differences have strong management implications for music school administrators.

These principles of learning when implemented in the classroom should assist each student to achieve goals more optimally. The five principles of learning recommended to facilitate student progress in the higher education curriculum are: provide meaningful content to students; obtain student interest in learning; guide learners to perceive purpose in goal attainment; make provisions for individual differences; and assist students to develop quality attitudes. The four philosophies of teaching emphasized are: a subject centered curriculum; problem solving procedures; measurably stated objectives; and decision making strategies. It is suggested that increased  emphasis be placed upon students identifying and solving vital problems pertaining to inherent course work with instructor guidance. Decision-making strategies could increasingly reflect a problem solving approach. Subject centered approaches might well stress the acquisition of content by students to solve problems.

        "description":"In 1967, the paths of educational reform in the United States and in England unexpectedly crossed with the publication of the Plowden Report in England and articles by Joseph Featherstone and Edward Yeoman in the United States. The years 1967-1974 marked important period in the development of American education, important in the professional lives of teachers and administrators in elementary schools. The way in which the experiments in &quot;open education&quot; in England influenced educational thinking in the United States is examined. The European and American tradition of progressive education is outlined with reference to Rousseau, Froebel, Addams, and Dewey, and it is shown in this context that the rise of progressive education in America was not solely due to the British influence,  but had a long tradition in American educational thinking. A history of the new beginning of progressive thought in education is given, and some of the effects on American education and schools are described. Six sections are as follows: introduction; personal impressions of English open education (1972); history of progressive education in Europe; history of progressive education in America; the effects of the British experience on &quot;open education&quot; in America; and conclusions.

After reviewing the history and curriculum of the Naval War College, the Army War College, the National War College, and the Air War College, it is concluded that the most likely models were an academic-technico combination. Since the Naval War College was founded first, it is logical to assume that the model employed by that institution was the basis for curriculum planning at the other institutions.

Professorial melancholia is defined as a progressive emotional process characterized by the negating of a university professor's professional motivation, positive attitudinal focus, and adequate personal self-esteem. The beliefs and environmental and personal factors found in the academic life that contribute to the three stages of professorial melancholia are discussed. Two irrational beliefs, that one must excel in all areas and be loved/approved of by everyone, are considered to be underlying factors, which may be exacerbated by the transition from being a graduate student to being a faculty member, with the resultant changes in the nature of relationships with both students and faculty and change from a  nurturing to a non-nurturing environment. The three stages are defined as early (where causal factors are beginning to have their detrimental effect), middle (where the influence of the initial causal factor is progressing and having a noticeable impact), and late (where the impact on the professor's environment, performance and lifestyle is most noticeable and negative). Counseling treatment that directly addresses the professorial role dysfunction is recommended. It is considered vital for therapists to see these issues in their totality, as important lifestyle and life support concerns that need to be addressed. Contains 19 references. (KM)",

        "description":"A discussion of the role of technology in teaching and learning in higher education focuses on obstacles to the successful infusion of information technologies in the classroom. It comes at a time when colleges and universities are poised for a giant leap forward into a variety of new technologies, a situation brought on by increasing societal pressure and continued advances in technology. Colleges and universities are faced with keeping pace with a technological revolution of mammoth proportions, but the pace of introduction of various technologies has moved slowly despite the increasing proliferation on the market of computing, audio, video, and such interactive technologies as videodisc and two-way audio-video systems. The role of information technology in higher education is  discussed in terms of historical perspectives, and reasons for using or not using technology. Information on the obstacles to appropriate and effective instructional use of information technologies is presented in relation to on-campus learning (technical, structural, and attitudinal obstacles) and distance learning (with the same obstacles). Despite various complex, interrelated obstacles to technology use there are signs of genuine progress in the development of varying uses of technology in colleges and universities. It is time to encourage strategies to pilot developments, expand existing usages, and cooperate with the private sector in order to embrace the profit motive and the goals of education. (SM)",

        "description":"In a study involving creative spelling, 300 kindergarten children and one first grader used computer programs to spell words in isolation and in stories they wrote. As the children made progress toward writing words in conventional spelling, they developed phonological spelling strategies similar to those that have previously been reported for children using paper and pencils. At the same time, they also developed visual spelling strategies in more detail than previously reported. There was no delay in the development of visual strategies to justify the claim that a new visual state of spelling occurs after a phonetic stage. The development of visual, print-based spelling strategies by the children is discussed in terms of the microcomputer's potential for accelerating the  acquisition of spelling skills, and includes the following observations: (1) stage theories of spelling development need to be adjusted to account for visual strategies in more detail before the transitional stage; (2) creative variations that follow a standard spelling are not simply a relapse to a transitional or phonetic stage; (3) sometimes only visual influences, but alternatively alternating and simultaneous visual and phonetic influences, appear in the development of a child's spelling; (4) the computer has exceptional capabilities for making children aware of letter relationships in spelling. A note on how to obtain the computer programs used in this study, 11 tables, and three figures are included. (27 references) (CGD)",

        "description":"This paper presents a blueprint for creating a partnership between public television and the educational community in the provision of educational technology. As a first priority, the plan calls for the implementation of an advocacy effort to make educational, governmental, and corporate decision-makers, as well as parents, aware of the potential benefits technology holds for motivating and instructing children. While recognizing the local and highly autonomous nature of both schools and public television stations, the plan calls for building and/or strengthening partnerships between the two, aggregating and reallocating existing resources, and embarking on new collaborative initiatives in pursuit of new resources to accomplish shared local and national goals. In laying out  responsibilities, the plan suggests continuation and significant enlargement of responsibilities for education and public television agencies at the local, state, regional, and national levels. In addition, the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) is charged with taking on the tasks of national advocacy and coordination to foster a national climate conducive to the enhanced and invigorated use of technology in meeting educational needs. Five appendixes provide a glossary of terms, a list of groups involved in preparing the preliminary 1990s budget, related resolutions adopted by the PBS board, and acknowledgements. (EW)",

        "description":"This study examines the relationship between high computer access and &quot;student empowerment&quot; at the Nashville, Tennessee, site of the Apple Classroom of Tomorrow (ACOT) project. The study rests on the premise that school learning is a function of the work carried out by students in school, and that schoolwork is experienced by students as a series of specific tasks. This sequence of tasks constitutes a specific treatment which over a period of time produces thoughts, feelings, and actions which have an influence on work habits, attitudes, and achievement scores. In this study, student empowerment refers to an internal student state where the student sees himself/herself as responsible for, or in control of, the source of his/her own learning. Subjects were two fourth grade  classrooms, one which participates in the ACOT project, and one which does not. Data collection included field notes, videotapes, interviews with teachers, and reviews of task materials and products. Results showed that high access to computers was associated with increased student empowerment in classroom learning settings. However, additional work needs to be undertaken to document the effects of various &quot;profiles of student empowerment&quot; (i.e., distribution of schoolwork task characteristics) on student learning. The text is supplemented by two figures and six tables, and two appendixes provide a copy of the task description form and a list of coding keys for several forms. (19 references) (EW)",

        "description":"Science and technology may affect the balance between First Amendment rights and government interests by changing power relationships between individuals and between individuals and the state. Technology will give rise to new ways of communicating which amplify the ways in which individuals and organizations express themselves. New technologies, such as electronic publishing, may not fit easily into old models of regulation, and First Amendment distinctions between the rights of print publishers, broadcasters, and common carriers will become increasingly difficult to justify. The open communication of scientific information--data, hypotheses, conclusions, explanatory theories, and technological know-how--is a special kind of speech or publication. There is no consensus on the  question of whether scientific communication enjoys the full protection provided by the First Amendment. It is well established that scientific communication can be limited when necessary to protect national security. However, as science and technology become ever more important to our economy and military strength, the delicate balance between individual rights and the national interest becomes both more important and more difficult to maintain. In some fields, basic research results can have direct and immediate implications for technological development, and a balance between the right of expression and the interests of the state in preserving security is very difficult to achieve. There are likely to be many situations in the future in which the government will assert compelling  reasons for limiting basic scientific communication.

Students need to consider the suitability of distance education for their needs and circumstances as well as the intellectual demands of studying at the tertiary level. Several institutions provide assistance by means of materials in which a student-centered approach is adopted. These are designed to enable individuals to realistically assess their expectations and aspirations. Some examples of such materials are discussed in order to illustrate the advantages (and limitations) of this approach. Seven examples of materials for self evaluation by students  are appended. These forms are designed to help the student: (1) analyze time used for studying; (2) assess his or her personal situation; (3) analyze family and friends' reactions to the student's decision to study with the Open University; (4) determine what the student expects to gain from such study; (5) assess the student's level of knowledge for a learning module and work that remains to be done; (6) evaluate progress in a course; and (7) identify the characteristics of a first-rate student.

        "description":"In fiscal years 1963-1985, the World Bank had experience with 32 investments in distance education projects in developing nations, including Malaysia, the Ivory Coast, Thailand, the Philippines, Malawi, and China. (Distance education is an educational delivery system that uses a variety of media and a system of feedback to provide education to people who are unable to attend traditional schools.) Lessons learned indicate that investments in distance education are most effective when there is agreement between the bank and the borrower on the educational objectives of the distance education component. It was also learned that distance education has been used to advantage when: (1) it is sharply focused on improving the quality of teaching available; (2) it is used to teach  nonformal &quot;equivalency&quot; education to students otherwise without teachers and classrooms; and (3) it is used to meet special needs and answer urgent needs for the formation of human capital.

It is noted that interviewing and qualitative analysis were chosen as the research methods both because the number of instructors involved was small, and because the study describes opinions, judgments, perceptions, and activities. Data from the interviews were categorized, and are discussed in this report as they relate to five major areas: (1) teaching techniques and strategies; (2) perceptions about students and their achievements; (3) perceptions about the electronic delivery system; (4) motivations; and (5) other perceptions.  Analyses of the data indicated that the faculty judged the project a success; the distance students learned and generally performed as well as on-campus students; and, even though some of the students were under-prepared, their experience and motivation seemed to overcome such shortcomings. Limitations in the electronic and support systems are also noted. It was also found that faculty were generally pleased with the system's capacity to carry discussions, convey humor, and augment directed learning, but that more preparation was required to provide highly structured learning experiences that would compensate for the limited discussion time and geographic separation.

        "description":"Arguing that traditional models are no longer effective in the information, age in which change will be a constant, this paper advocates the use of team-management to ensure two-way communication in an academic library. The need for both creative approaches to problem-solving and managing the library organization and a new organizational structure to address the changes brought about by new technologies are discussed, as well as the challenges currently faced by library managers as a result of these changes. The team approach to library management is then discussed with emphasis on the need for a high level of trust and respect in the working environment. A discussion of the roles of the team and its members highlights the importance of the members' commitment to the aims and  purposes of the team and the need for good communication skills. A new model for the Cleveland State University Libraries is then described which features a new organizational structure that blends services and softens area demarcations to accommodate the automation of all services, including collection management, information, document delivery, bibliographic, and administrative services, with staff responsibility crossovers. The developmental stages through which the new organizational structure has progressed are described, and it is suggested that decision making, a climate of trust, and communication are crucial to the success of the organizational structure and team management. An organization chart for the Cleveland State University Libraries is attached. (24 references)  (CGD)",

The model is applied to the library organization, and problems which may arise from various interpretations of messages are considered. The relationship between information and meaning is then examined. The communication of meaning and the transformation of the ideation inherent in the members of the organization into an ideology to be shared are identified as leadership roles. Coincident and equifinal meanings and their roles in organizational communication are explored, and it is concluded that success in a library depends on the initiative of meaning as both a function and a definition of leadership.

Bibliographic data from 15 abstracting journals covering the literature in six fields--engineering, medical, physical, mathematical and social sciences, and humanities--were used in testing the goodness-of-fit of the shifted Waring distribution and 13 other discrete probability models. The preliminary findings presented here are based on 60 data sets collected from 10 abstracting journals covering the literature in the mathematical and social sciences and humanities. They  indicate that the promising models for the distribution of authorships are the shifted Waring, shifted generalized negative binomial, shifted negative binomial, shifted generalized Poisson, and shifted inverse Gaussian-Poisson distributions. Three advantages and possible practical applications of a model for the distribution of authorships include: (1) ability to summarize the entire frequency distribution by a few parameters of the model; (2) estimation of the number of entries in an author index; and (3) usefulness in a simulation study designed to determine, subject to space constraints, the maximum number of authors per paper to be included in an author index.

It then introduces the user-concentric approach, which is based on three assumptions: relevance is a multidimensional concept based on the human judgment process; it is dependent on both internal (cognitive) and external (situational) factors; and it is intersubjective but nevertheless systematic and measurable. Currently being explored at Syracuse University, this new approach is described as a model which explores relevance in the context of the sense-making approach, and places the user, not the system, in the role of the central and active determinant of the dimensions of relevance.

        "description":"Economic development grants have had a significant impact on the economy of Illinois and have been an excellent investment for the state. Reports submitted by the state's community colleges indicate that they assisted nearly 5,700 newly established and existing businesses and industries during fiscal year (FY) 1988. The cornerstone of the colleges' involvement in economic development is a network of business centers and economic development offices operated by each of Illinois' 39 community college districts. The primary purpose of the centers is to coordinate customized job training programs for new and existing business and industry and to provide entrepreneurship assistance. In FY 1988, the community colleges: (1) assisted in the creation and retention of 38,424 jobs, the  start up or expansion of 113 companies, and the retention of 140 companies; (2) provided customized training for 1,468 companies through 2,164 courses; (3) conducted 1,819 entrepreneurship workshops and seminars and provided small business counseling and management assistance; (4) helped obtain $35,599,616 in contracts for Illinois businesses; and (5) helped to establish or operate small business incubators, or centers that provide special facilities, training, and services. In addition to these primary activities, the colleges helped to operate labor/management councils, provided quality control training, and offered training and job search services for persons seeking employment. The annual report on the economic development grants includes supporting data tables. (AJL)",

First, the historical overview explains the &quot;articulation compact&quot; established by the Illinois Board of Education in 1970 to encourage Illinois universities to grant junior standing to transfer students who have completed associate degrees based on baccalaureate-oriented sequences and to consider their lower-division general education requirements satisfied. Next, the report considers the following transfer articulation issues and offers recommendations for their resolution: (1) challenges to the &quot;articulation  compact&quot; by some universities; (2) variations in general education or core degree requirements among community colleges; (3) program and course articulation problems caused by differences in specific course content, changes in university course requirements, and changes required by external certification and accrediting groups; (4) the need for two- and four-year institutions to make special efforts to increase the number of minority students who complete associate degrees and subsequently transfer and complete baccalaureate degrees; (5) access to public universities for associate in arts and associate in science graduates; (6) the scope and effectiveness of academic advising at community colleges; (7) changes in university degree requirements; (8) student transcript policies and  procedures; (9) nontraditional student populations; (10) maintenance of academic standards and instructional quality in telecourses; (11) transferability of dual credit enrollment courses; and (12) articulating associate in applied science degree programs.

University-parallel programs were added to its previous technical curriculum, which had been designed for immediate entry into the workforce. Subsequently, a study was conducted at PSTCC to ascertain faculty and staff perceptions of current college goals; to elicit opinions about what the new institution's goals should be; to identify changes in perceptions of goals from those held before 1986; and to compare local views about goals to national norms. The Community College Goals Inventory Survey was administered to 115 employees, including 38 former STIK faculty, 11 faculty members who had transferred to PSTCC from Roane State Community  College, 9 other new faculty members, 25 support staff members, and 28 administrators. Respondents were asked to rank 97 statements in 20 goal areas according to the degree that they were current college goals and the degree that they should be. Results included the following: (1) the four areas ranked most highly as current college goals were vocational/technical preparation, general education, remedial/developmental support, and accessibility; (2) top areas ranked in terms of &quot;should be&quot; goals included general education, college community, vocational/technical preparation, and remedial/developmental support; and (3) respondents believed that more emphasis should be given to every goal area, with the largest discrepancies between &quot;is a goal&quot; and &quot;should be a goal&quot; in the areas of college  community, faculty/staff development, intellectual environment, and humanism/altruism. Six tables and a sheet containing descriptions of the 20 goal areas are attached. (AAC)",

Because foundations are legally and organizationally independent of the college, they are able to promote the well-being of the college without the statutory limits imposed by the governing board and staff. Foundation money is not restricted to basic functions and permits colleges to implement programs and services not within their operating budgets. Ties with community leaders can be strengthened through foundations, while alumni and other supporters gain an opportunity to show their appreciation in tangible ways. Four phases in the development of a foundation have been identified as: (1) the development of articles of incorporation and by-laws; (2) the education of the foundation  board on the college's programs; (3) the initiation of a large scale community relations campaign; and (4) the planning of fund-raising activities and other events for the coming year. An important measure of the effectiveness of a foundation is the number and amount of donations it solicits. The most effective methods of fund-raising include direct mailings, special events, annual fund campaigns, and other activities. The commitment of the college and foundation administration, however, is the key to the foundation's success. The report includes a list of references. (AJL)",

        "description":"Increasingly, educators are being challenged to find meaningful ways to meet the needs of nontraditional college students. A transdisciplinary model is useful in meeting these needs, in that it focuses on the individual and is characterized by a sharing of information and skills across traditional disciplinary boundaries. This model was conceived when others, such as the unidisciplinary, intradisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and interdisciplinary models, failed to accomplish their purpose. El Paso Community College, which serves a number of nontraditional students, has incorporated two transdisciplinary programs. The Faculty Mentoring Program assists students not so much with course content as with the learning and coping skills that they will need throughout their academic  career. The faculty selected are those with both low attrition rates for high-risk courses and extensive teaching and counseling experience. The English as a Second Language (ESL) Credit Program offers students the benefit of learning English through courses designed by three different disciplines: ESL, Reading, and Speech. ESL students are required to enroll in three co-requisite courses at each skill level (two ESL and one Reading) and are advised to take a Speech course as well. Although neither program has been been evaluated, both have received positive responses from students and faculty and show promise for reaching nontraditional students. Additional information on the two programs is appended. (AJL)",

These responses indicate that: (1) the fact that quality instruction is the primary mission of California's community colleges is reflected in job descriptions, and the focus on job applicants' teaching competency  in letters of recommendation and job interviews; (2) the initial funding provided by AB 1725 resulted in a 25% increase of $5 million for staff and faculty development in the community colleges, while proposals for fiscal year 1989-90 requested an increase to approximately $10 million; (3) the Board of Governors is working carefully to suggest incentives, provide resources, guide local decisions, and assure appropriate evaluations of its incentives to improve teaching; and (4) while $20 million of \"new\" Staff and Faculty Development Funds would be needed each year to run a competent and professional faculty development program in the California community colleges, $70 million annually is needed to fully fund the goals of ACR 39.

Four operational data sets are analyzed: full-time equivalent (FTE) and headcount enrollments and cost per FTE; VTAE graduates; operational faculty and staff compensation; and district finances. Data are presented for the state as a whole and for each district. In addition, concerns and misapprehensions are addressed with respect to labor market information and projections, high technology, enrollment management, and fiscal planning. Highlighted findings include the following: (1) state VTAE FTE enrollment peaked in 1982-83 at 64,303 students, followed by declines ranging  from 1% to 6.5% in most subsequent years; (2) though four of the 16 VTAE districts showed enrollment increases between 1986-87 and 1987-88, the system experienced an overall decrease of 2.5% from 58,091 to 56,622 students; (3) in 13 districts, the majority of students were women; (4) one college enrolled 55% of the system's minority students; (5) the percentage of associate degree enrollments increased from 46% in 1979-80 to 54% in 1987-88; (6) direct instructional costs for the Technical Division increased 144% between 1979-80 and 1987-88, compared to 113% for all other divisions; and (7) statewide, Nursing Assistant, Accounting, and Nursing programs had the largest number of graduates in 1987-88.

The next section provides brief descriptions of LRC-based developmental education, computer literacy, and computer-assisted instruction programs including LRC involvement in telecourses. In the next section, selected  programs are featured, illustrating the various functions performed by LRC's in instructional improvement and development. Concluding comments note the range of programs and services within the two-year college LRC's mandate and point to factors that influence their ability to fulfill their mission. (AAC)",

        "description":"General education is the process of developing a framework on which to place knowledge stemming from a variety of sources. Its goals are to help students think critically, develop values, understand traditions, respect diverse cultures and opinions, and, most importantly, put that knowledge to use. Even though its goals parallel socially supported values, general education has met with opposition within the academic community. Examples of the problems encountered by general education include the following: (1) it is difficult to measure whether a general education program has fulfilled its goals, since changes in students' actions beyond the institution do not lend themselves to assessment by easily administered and scored examinations; (2) the organizational structure of  community colleges, based on the university pattern of academic departments, is antithetical to general education; and (3) universities have not been supportive in granting transfer credit for general education courses. In addition, some educators openly oppose general education requirements, arguing that students with specific and limited educational goals do not have the time for such courses. However, the community college's mission and the characteristics of its students both support arguments favoring general education for all students. To provide common learning, most institutions have developed some type of course distribution list with offerings arrayed under the major headings of science, social science, humanities, and communication. A less widespread approach involves an  attenuated list of interdisciplinary courses that fulfill general education requirements. Despite barriers on one hand and the innovative contributions of certain colleges on the other, the prognosis for general education is no better or worse than it has been at any other time in the history of the community college.

        "description":"In this day of increased competition for students, educators need to know what makes their institution exceptional or how it is perceived as providing something of value that other institutions in the local area do not. Without this information, community colleges will find it difficult to thrive and adapt in the future. Efforts to determine the existence, nature, and strength of an institution's unique aspects must consider both empirical and perceptual dimensions of distinction. The college needs to identify its unique programs, services, and characteristics, and also compare the image that the college projects to the outside world with the perceptions held by internal constituents. The search for institutional distinctiveness can be accomplished by either a college committee  or a consultant, with both approaches offering advantages and disadvantages. When integrated with strategic planning and decision-making processes, the results of such a search can contribute to the creation of a vision of the institution that can be shared by all members of the college community, to the development and communication of a positive institutional image, and eventually, to the development of institutional integrity.

While the findings are not definitive, they reflect consistent themes which have emerged from both the personal testimony presented by parents and children in Select Committee hearings, and the evidence presented by prominent scholars and practitioners. Highlighted are trends in economic security, poverty, child care, housing, education, health, and child welfare. These trends suggest disturbing realities for many of America's children and families. During the 1980s, millions of American families have fallen behind. The number of children in poverty continues to grow, with children  replacing older persons as America's poorest age group. The number of non-elderly persons without health insurance, one-third of whom are children, has increased dramatically over the past decade. Many families, especially young ones, are finding it increasingly difficult to house and educate their children, pay for child care, save for the future, and care for dependent parents. Full-time employment, even of both parents, often is not enough to keep families out of poverty. (RH)",

To understand faith in Afro-American culture, the roots of Afro-American culture in general, and religious aspects of that culture in particular, must be analyzed. Such an analysis must begin with consideration of Afro-Americans' African heritage. In keeping with these principles, this paper discusses: (1) the African heritage; (2) features of the slave religion; (3) black faith and suffering; (4) transmission of faith through the oral tradition; (5) the role of proverb tradition in the socialization of Afro-American children; and (6) faith as taught by the hero and heroine in black children's folktales and literature.

        "description":"Progress of Oregon's State Prekindergarten Program (SPP) during its first 3 months of program operation is reported. Serving mostly low-income, 3- and 4-year-old children, the SPP offers health, nutrition, education, and social services to children and their families. Parent involvement and education are important program components. This progress report provides demographic data collected in October, 1988 that afford a first look at the characteristics of the children, families, and staff involved in the 11 SPPs funded for the 1988-89 academic year. Also reported are findings of an assessment of the development of 67 SPP children from three sites, and interviews that focused on staff's and local educational leaders' expectations for and perceptions of the program. The SPP  children scored nearly one-half standard deviation below the mean in all five developmental domains of the McCarthy Scales for Children. No difference was found in the scores of boys and girls. Differences were found between sites. Interview data indicated considerable optimism for the programs and overwhelmingly indicated expectations that programs would enrich children's lives and prepare children for school. It was also expected that parents would receive much-needed assistance. The report consists primarily of 20 tables, 9 charts, and accompanying text. (RH)",

        "description":"This pilot study of the structural characteristics of daily routines of young children also explored aspects of conceptual framework and research instruments. Four data collection instruments were developed. Two of the three retrospective measures used were questionnaires for mothers about their child's routine on the previous day. The other measure was an interview with mothers about the previous day. In addition, a diary that was carried throughout the day by each child was used by all of the children's caregivers to record each child's activities during the daily routine. The daily routine of a child was considered to be the succession of the different settings the child entered during the course of a day. Settings were described in terms of space and material, and of personal  and action dimensions. Two questionnaires and a standardized parent interview were constructed for investigating family background factors, and were implemented with three samples. Reported findings concern four questions: (1) Do the data give differing pieces of information about daily routines of young children? (2) Do different types of daily routines exist? (3) Are different types of daily routines connected with family background factors? (4) Do inexpensive retrospective and expensive diary approaches differ in data quality? (RH)",

A representative of law enforcement officers described difficulties realistic toy guns present to police. The president of the Toy Manufacturers of America gave reasons for the organization's support for Senate Bill 1981, that calls for the use of blaze orange barrel plugs on toy guns to differentiate them from real weapons. An officer of the Daisy Manufacturing Company offered support for the Senate Bill. A gun collector urged  that nonfiring antique replicas be excluded from the provisions of the bill.

The focus on the first 60 months involved three basic components: education, health, and community and public awareness. Particular attention was given to means of developing parent involvement in early education programs. The focus on child care involved ways of building rewards into caregiver training programs and mandating minimal training requirements for caregivers. The group focusing on 4-year-old  programs provided a preliminary program description and set of recommendations. The group that concentrated on a curriculum for 4-year-olds provided recommendations based on findings that indicated that programs must: (1) be based on the current interpretation of child development research; (2) employ only professionally trained personnel; and (3) center on needs and characteristics of 4-year-olds and their families. A literature review and survey data provided the basis for recommendations on admission age for kindergarten. Concluding remarks concern the state role in implementing the recommendations. (RH)",

The report describes IAF's In-Country Support System (ICS), staffed by local professionals who assist grantees and report their progress. The ICS is described as an intermediary agency for many grassroots groups that have no affiliation to, or assistance from, local private development organizations. School programs in Venezuela and Bolivia are briefly described. There is a section of &quot;1987 Program Highlights&quot; offering general information on various types of grants: agricultural/rural development; education and training; community services; urban enterprises; and  cultural expression. Another section discusses the role IAF plays in developing countries and some of the problems overcome by the agency and its grantees. This document contains a series of country reports describing amounts and purposes of 234 grants made to grantee agencies in 1987. Grantee agencies were in the following countries: Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Bolivia, Chile, Brazil, Antigua, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica, St. Kitts, St. Vincent, Belize, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Mexico, El Salvador, Peru, and Ecuador. Articles focus on rural development projects in Paraguay and Chile, pesticide safety in Ecuador, Brazilian education projects, fishing assistance in Dominica, a Guatemalan program for widowed mothers, a  Colombian sanitation program, and a Mexican survey on women's economic roles.

There are multiple realities within North Carolina. The average income has increased, unemployment rates have dropped, and educational levels have risen. The report attributes these increases to the influx of educated professionals. Another reality is that native North Carolinians are not benefiting from the overall growth of the state. There are very separate, unequal worlds within the state, almost to the point of social and economic polarization. The three &quot;R's&quot; of human geography--resources, residence, and race--are discussed as the divisors of the state. A covenant for North Carolina is  presented as an attempt to unite all state residents in a commitment to enhance personal, interpersonal, and state development. Four areas are identified and discussed as priorities for action: (1) lifting the working poor out of poverty; (2) fostering entrepreneurship; (3) meeting the needs of young children; and (4) expanding the voluntary sector. Improving and revitalizing elementary and secondary education programs, improving developmental and health care for children, and utilizing human resources effectively are identified as critical needs in North Carolina.

Congress designs and implements national policy; therefore, its composition affects advancements in rural policy. Rural residents comprise 24% of the U.S. population, but are &quot;under-represented&quot; in the House of Representatives. Rural districts number 88, or 20%, indicating that geographic representation is not uniform. In terms of seniority and leadership, rural Representatives lag behind their urban colleagues, occupying less than 17% of key leadership positions. Senators represent rural interests by a greater proportion due to the design of the Senate. The Congressional Joint  Economic Committee outlined principles of rural policy as a foundation on which successful rural programs could be based. It identified features unique to rural America; stressed the importance of national awareness; underscored the need for access to technology, information, public facilities and services; recognized the urgency of private sector initiative and teamwork among all participants; and showed rural America to be a part of and affected by the U.S. and world economy. The Committee drafted a &quot;Rural Rights Act&quot; emphasizing that people cannot be discriminated against on the basis of geographic location. This report calls for a rural coalition with members from local, county, and state governments; the private sector; and civic, social, religious, and professional organizations to  advance the cause for rural America.

This report presents the results of a study assessing the impact of the Outward Bound experience on these students. Data gathering instruments included: the Self Report Survey (SRS), developed by Dr. Chris Jennstadt, Department of Psychology, Dartmouth College; a questionnaire sent to parents; and school records. The SRS was administered as a pretest, a post-test, and a six-month follow-up. The following SRS subscales were of primary interest in this study: self-depreciation; sociability; achievement motivation; social consciousness; hopelessness and social pessimism; self-confidence; and general well-being. The Statistical Package  for the Social Sciences for the personal computer was used for repeated measures analysis of the SRS data. Five of the subscales showed significant positive change between the first and last administration of SRS. School records were used to gather information on each student's grade-point average and school attendance. There were no statistically significant changes in their academic achievement or school attendance. Analysis of the questionnaire reflecting the parents' assessment of their child's behavior after the Outward Bound experience indicated positive behavioral and attitudinal changes.

Significant barriers to high student performance are briefly discussed and research findings about strategies designed to overcome these barriers and to lead to high performance are reviewed. Solutions for educating disadvantaged students should not be flawed by a \"remedial and cultural deficit mentality,\" with low expectations for performance of disadvantaged students. Research suggests a new vision for educating these students incorporating these aspects: (1) high expectations by the family, community, and school; (2) active participation by parents and community; (3) instruction in not only basic skills but in learning-to-learn and thinking skills; (4) cultural  sensitivity and relevance in materials and teaching practices; and (5) new teaching and grouping strategies such as mastery learning, cooperative learning, and peer tutoring. The following public policy issues raised by this new vision are presented: (1) the need for new partnerships with business, industry, and labor; (2) new policy perspectives on the relationship between equity and excellence; (3) the nature of accountability expectations of the schools; (4) options for implementing the need strategies; (5) long- versus short-range perspectives on strategies for change; and (6) the need for continuing governmental support as well as mandates. The underlying theme of the report is that effective education of the disadvantaged is a major social and economic issue, not just an educational  one. This report contains a 77-item bibliography.

The East Mississippi Center for Educational Development is a consortium of 16 rural school districts and the Meridian Branch of Mississippi State University. The Center assists school districts in developing and implementing quality staff development programs. Teacher attitudes toward staff development, a major concern identified by school administrators, was measured by a questionnaire developed by surveying 100 randomly selected elementary and secondary teachers. The top 11 concerns were used as questionnaire items. Another randomly selected group of 80 elementary and 80 secondary teachers  responded to the items using a 5 point Likert type scale. Analysis procedures for the responses included frequency of responses and an examination of the mean item responses. Chi square analyses were conducted to determine if significant differences existed between responses of elementary and secondary teachers. Responses to all items revealed neutral to negative attitudes towards staff development and related activities. Secondary teachers were more negative in their responses than were elementary teachers. The study supports administrators' concerns relative to negative teacher attitudes toward staff development and related activities.

A central issue was a proposal transferring management of Indian schools from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to tribes or local governments. Statements from federal and local authorities centered on the quality of education under the current BIA system. Included in the report are statements from local education officials and leaders from several tribes. An appendix includes letters, statements, and testimony expressing concerns about the proposal from school, community, and tribal leaders. Concerns about the proposed transfer of authority centered around educational quality, that is, whether there would be a reduction of  services or funds after the proposed legislation was put into effect. Proponents of the transfer argued that it would mean increased local and tribal control over the BIA schools. Federal officials contended that the move was not a budget-cutting measure and said the BIA would still monitor many aspects of school construction and maintenance. Native Americans represented in the proceedings included members of the Navajo, Apache, and Pueblo nations. Attachments include data comparing test results of American Indian children in New Mexico with those of Hispanics and Anglos. There is also a history of the relationship between the federal government and the Jicarilla Apache Indians of New Mexico. The history focuses on Indian education. (TES)",

It profiles the state primarily in terms of population patterns, economy, labor force, education, and environment; secondarily in terms of health and social services, infrastructure and aspects of government performance. State and federal statistics and research projects by schools and businesses provide the informational base. The state's present condition is linked to recent historical trends and is compared to the rest of the United States as a whole and to Southern states as a region. Numerous maps and graphs illustrate various population characteristics, rates of population growth and distribution, trends in income and employment levels, concentration of land  ownership, land values, sizes of businesses, education levels and expenditures, pollution levels, access to health care, infant mortality rates, and evidence of racial inequities. Issues shaping North Carolina's future are discussed, based on trend projections and considerations of current resources. Policies for social services, welfare benefits, and low- and moderate-income housing are critically examined. Education, the economy, and the environment are seen as interrelated, but unbalanced in terms of resource allocation. The presented data and other studies reveal a North Carolina that is rife with problems and rich with possibilities. Despite interests that vary according to region, class, race, occupation, and so forth, there must be an attempt to identify collective goals, to assess  how effectively they are being pursued, and to encourage collective consideration of issues and the creation of strategies that work.

Replicable achievement differences in mathematics were observed across grade levels for student SES and race, but not for gender. The only replicable interaction to emerge was a relatively weak, but persistent SES by race effect that occurred for all analyses involving students attending low SES schools. Although achievement increased across student SES level for both white and black students the increment tended to be slightly larger  for white students. Replicable differences in self-esteem occurred for student SES and gender. Race differences, in the form of a grade level by race interaction, occurred only within low SES schools. Supplementary analyses of mathematics achievement incorporating school SES and race were also performed. In addition to significant results for each main effect several interactions were found, the most prominent being a race by school SES effect, which occurred at each grade level.

Until recently, the cause of earthquakes was a mystery and the subject of fanciful folklore to people all around the world. This curriculum considers both scientific and popular explanations for the phenomenon, and discusses the pattern of earthquakes worldwide. The series of lessons in this teaching package are basically hands-on experiences which require materials already in the classroom or those that are easily located. The manual consists of six units: (1) \"Defining an Earthquake\"; (2) \"Why and Where Earthquakes Occur\"; (3) \"Physical Results of Earthquakes\";  (4) \"Measuring Earthquakes\"; (5) \"Recognizing an Earthquake\"; and (6) \"Earthquake Safety and Survival.\" An appendix deals with information on the background of earthquakes including legends; definition; plate tectonic theory and occurrence; types of plate motion and detection; the book of legends; and the curriculum's scope and sequence chart. Reproducible materials are included for teacher use. (RT)",

One is the degree to which students memorize laws, facts, and principles, and the second involves the role of the classroom teacher. These aspects result in a discrepancy between the theory and practice of science education. The purpose of this report is to provide: (1) a recapitulation of the targets causing the difficulty, the rationale, and the research questions; (2) a chronology of 18 months of work; (3) descriptions of the instructional material, teacher training, software, and experiments performed; (4) research findings; and (5) provisional conclusions and relevant issues concerning the research. Teachers involved in the study stated that they would use the technique again. Pilot teachers admitted  feeling more comfortable using the materials in teaching the second class than their initial class. Most teachers found that the higher level of thinking required and the use of the scientific method made the materials more appealing. About one in eight of the teachers preferred alternate materials or teaching strategies to this method. The appendices include suggested revisions of software, tally sheets, homework assignments, teacher pre/post questionnaires, a student post questionnaire, and student pre/post tests. A reference list is also cited. (RT)",

The project also examines the effectiveness of using STELLA, a simulation-modeling software program, as a tool by which to examine scientific and historical phenomena. The research focuses on learning outcomes and cognitive processing, particularly self-regulation, that are activated in an instructional environment that  requires students to use high-order cognitive skills in the examination of dynamic phenomena.

While this research has not answered all the questions about household water treatment systems, current information that may be of immediate use to homeowners is available. This booklet is intended specifically for homeowners who suspect that the water they get from their own well, or water they receive from a water utility that uses well water, may be a significant source of radon in their homes.

This paper investigates the effects of a new mathematics curriculum on girls' choice of mathematics, attitudes toward mathematics, achievement in mathematics, choice of university study, and achievement in the university. A total of 44 schools as the experimental group, and 41 schools as the control group, were selected and matched on the variables of location, size, and ratio of boys to girls. Conclusions are as follows: (1) the new mathematics curriculum leads to more mathematics choice in high school by girls; (2) there is no attitude change toward mathematics; (3) the new mathematics curriculum does not lead to a smaller difference in  achievement level between boys and girls than the old curriculum; and (4) the pretension of the new curriculum to make a better fit between high school and university cannot be supported.

        "description":"The question of whether to teach computer programming to elementary and secondary students has been widely debated. This study examines the relationship between computer programming experience, mathematics experience, and general variable skill. The sample consisted of 46 students (aged 9 to 17) at a summer computer camp. The programming level was determined from results of a camp placement test as novice, intermediate, or advanced. Mathematics experience was defined as the number of years of algebra-and-above courses that students had completed. Variable skill was determined from scores on the General Variable Skill Test. This study reports that both computer experience and mathematics experience were significantly correlated with general variable skill. Further, the  relationship of computer programming experience with general variable skill was stronger than the relationship of mathematics experience with the variable skill. (YP)",

        "description":"The environmental movement of the 1960's and early 1970's resulted in unprecedented attention to environmental issues both in the mass media and in the scholarly literature. Interest has waned in recent years, with a concomitant erosion of coverage of what many consider enduring problems--particularly in water and air pollution and nuclear power. This monograph brings together both an historical perspective and a current picture of one critical element in the environmental-movement dynamic: the clash between environmental activists and their target organizations. Each chapter focuses on a different actor in that conflict--pressure groups, the media that cover them, governmental agencies with the power to regulate their opponents or the public relations practitioners employed by  the organizations they oppose. All the chapters emphasize the role that communication plays in disputes between organizations and activists. Included are: (1) \"Community Pluralism and Newspaper Coverage of a High-Level Nuclear Waste Siting Issue\" (Sharon Dunwoody and Marshel Rossow); (2) \"Media and Protest\" (C. N. Olien, P. J. Tichenor, and G. A. Donohue); (3) \"Today's College Youth--A Generation at Rest\" (Mark A. Larson); (4) \"A Situational Theory of Environmental Issues, Publics, and Activists\" (James E. Grunig); and (5) \"Activism in the Northwest: Surveying the Effects of Public Relations on Conflict Resolution\" (Larissa A. Grunig). (CW)",

        "description":"Since 1985, Congress has provided the U.S. Department of Education with funds for a program to improve the availability and quality of math and science teachers at the elementary and secondary level. This effort was initiated in response to concern that the math and science skills of elementary and secondary school students were insufficient to meet the demands of the work place and to keep the Nation competitive in the international economy. In 1988, the Congress repealed the original authority for the program and authorized a somewhat modified version as the Dwight D. Eisenhower Mathematics and Science Education Act. The Eisenhower program is focused more fully on math and science education than the original. Evaluation data on the original version of the math and science  program indicates that funds appear to have been spent largely on inservice training for current math and science teachers, not on activities to retrain personnel or attract new math and science teachers. Some localities used the funds to help meet new state requirements affecting math and science instruction. This report provides an overview of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Mathematics and Science Education Act, administered by the U.S. Department of Education. It analyzes program provisions, funding history, and program evaluations. (Author/CW)",

Virtually every major industrialized nation has, in recent years, examined its science and mathematics education system and many have taken steps to improve the scope and quality of scientific and mathematical understanding among school graduates. Measures of scientific literacy provide a general yardstick of the proportion of adults in a society who have sufficient skills and knowledge to function effectively in citizenship and consumer roles. Previous studies have found that relatively few citizens in the United States and other industrialized nations understand basic scientific terms or can make sense of  conflicting arguments from experts on issues like nuclear power. Studies of recent high school graduates in the United States do not point to significant generational improvement. This paper focuses primarily on the data from the United States and outlines some improved measures of scientific literacy with bridges to past measures.

        "description":"Some interesting work currently being done in science education research is with scientifically misconceived ideas about the causes and mechanisms of natural phenomena. Though not stated explicitly, it can be inferred from the corpus of this misconception research that an assumption of homogeneity among students is made, even where there is gender, racial, and cultural diversity among students. Specifically, it is assumed that students come into secondary and college science classes with relatively homogeneous, fundamental views of the natural world, capable of assimilating and valuing modern scientific understanding when science knowledge is presented in traditional inquiry fashion. This paper is a theoretical work on the fundamental, epistemological structure of the mind, or  more simply, world view. The researcher believes that it is a mistake to assume that there is worldview homogeneity in the typical classroom and that this assumption retards a more comprehensive understanding of factors that lead to science achievement and positive science attitudes. Specifically, the purpose of this paper is to present a logico-structural model of world view and to discuss its potential for use in science education research. Although this paper begins with a focus on science misconception research, it is intended that the relevance of worldview theory to other research interests become evident. (CW)",

        "description":"An investigation derived from the logico-structural theory of world view was conducted for the purpose of examining the relationship between science interest and variations in the causal universal within college students' world views. This required the development of a special pen-and-paper instrument for detecting worldview variations in the causal universal. The instrument was based on the assumption that when a student is faced with an unfamiliar phenomenon, he or she is more likely to accept an explanation that is more consistent with his or her world view than an explanation of the phenomenon that is less consistent. The test involved making a choice between explanations that were scientifically-more and scientifically-less compatible. The test, along with a measure of  science interest, was given to 120 college freshmen. The test, alone, was given to a group of professional scientists. The results suggested that there was considerable worldview variation among the students and that this variation was related to science interest. It was also found that even the students with science interests were less likely to choose a scientifically-more compatible explanation than were the professional scientists. It was concluded that the investigation lends corroboration to the logico-structural theory of world view. (Author/CW)",

The survey instruments were designed in the traditional forced-choice format in which two alternatives were presented, one representing delay of gratification and the other representing immediate gratification. The results were then compared to surveys given in an earlier study to black student leaders and found to be similar.

By the year 2000, the U.S. population will be less than 76 percent White and more than 24 percent minority. The minority student populations of Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans are rapidly increasing, especially in urban areas. Their school graduation rates remain low while their dropout rates continue to rise. The academic achievement of these minority students is well below that of most White students. The percentage of Blacks and Hispanic students living in poverty is high. Unwed teenage pregnancies are rising, and a  recent study links academic failure with teenage pregnancies. Nearly one-half of Black households are headed by a female and more than two-thirds of all children living in female-headed households receive government assistance. Education level is linked to employment, and future workers without any post-secondary education or training are likely to find themselves employed in temporary positions or unemployed. Any discussion of employment and workers must include the serious problem of illiteracy (defined as reading below the eighth grade level) and its impact on the economy. It is estimated that 13 percent of the U.S. adult population may be illiterate and 40 percent marginally illiterate. (DJC)",

Specifically, the report states that the Secretary of the Interior has not established an adequate preservation training program for the department and that the six agencies have not been adequately protecting, preserving, and maintaining some of their properties. These agencies believe that they need better guidance from the Secretary of the Interior's office and more specific program funding. The GAO  recommendations include: (1) ensuring that historic properties be given preference over nonhistoric properties; (2) establishing agency-wide time frames to locate, inventory, and nominate historic properties; and (3) emphasizing that properties must be adequately protected, preserved, and maintained. Appendices contain: (1) Section 110 of the amended National Historic Preservation Act of 1966; (2) a list of the reviewed sites; (3) a list of service awards; and (4) response comments to the GAO's evaluation. Four black and white photographs are included. (DJC)",

A distinguishing feature of discipline based art education is the use of visual imagery to transmit meaning to students. Discipline based art education incorporates concepts and skills from aesthetics, art criticism, art history, and art production and presents a unique approach to teaching art. This paper describes discipline based art education's: (1) conceptual focus; (2) structure; and (3) emphasis on students' manipulation of art materials to form visual images. Six elementary school discipline based art education lessons are suggested and briefly described. Four are developed into lesson plans that include: (1) the topic; (2) the grade level; (3) learning objectives; (4) a visual analysis of  related vocabulary words and images; (5) art production materials, demonstrations, activities and evaluation; and (6) suggestions for a critical and historical evaluation of related art works and artists. The importance of this instructional sequence is described, along with a rationale for teaching discipline based art education to elementary school students. Fifteen references are included.

The second article, &quot;National Initiatives in Social Education in Australia&quot; (K. J. Kennedy) presents some current education initiatives of the Curriculum Development Centre (Australia) and the future of social education in the Australian curriculum. The 1984 Beazley recommendations for social education curriculum planners is the  focus of &quot;Implications of the Beazley Report for Social Education in Western Australia&quot; (B. Wells), and the article reports that the recommendations indirectly upgrade social education programs in schools. The fourth article, &quot;Critical Issues in Moral Values Education&quot; (R. A.

The US/USSR Textbook Study Project, suspended in 1980 when President Jimmy Carter ended U.S. cultural exchanges with the Soviet Union after the Afghanistan invasion, resumed in 1986 with different expert participants and has yet to be completed. Twenty-five U.S. textbooks and eight Soviet textbooks were chosen, translated, and exchanged for review. Four guidelines were established to guide the project: (1) only history and geography textbooks would be studied; (2) textbook coverage would be restricted to US-USSR relations; (3) the reviews would have a limited distribution; and (4) criticisms would be freely provided and would be  used as recommendations for textbook updates. The advantages of bilateral textbook study, while fewer than the disadvantages, are considered more powerful and include: (1) the active involvement of a significant number of people and organizations; (2) the cultural exchange resulting from the official meetings in the United States and the Soviet Union; and (3) the openmindedness that came from the verbal and written interaction between the two countries' professionals. Some of the disadvantages for bilateral textbook study include the unguided judgment of the experts, the restrictions, and the constant turnover of textbook use. The appendices contain a list of the U.S. and Soviet participants and a list of the textbook titles. Two references are included. (DJC)",

Roofs and windows are adapted for the hot, rainy climate, while the availability of building materials ranges from palm leaves to mud and dung mixtures in the villages to burnt brick and concrete structures in the cities. Buildings in cities and villages also reflect the Indian caste system. The number of courtyards that a house has indicates the owner's wealth just as the color of stone in the past reflected the ethnicity of its occupants. Religions can also be determined by the lotus flower or leaf shape of the windows (Buddhism or Hinduism) or the separate quarters  for men and women (orthodox Moslems). Indian tradition forbids visitors to enter a host's kitchen, so they are always set apart from other rooms. Architecture in India's cities is changing as India is modernized. (DJC)",

In Indian cities, male literacy is higher than female literacy, and literacy rates are higher for nonscheduled caste females than scheduled caste females. In most cities, the disparity between gender literacy rates is lower, and this is also true within the castes. Social movements in India are examined to offer explanations for the literacy patterns within regions. Community populations containing either Moslems who generally lower or Christians who generally raise literacy rates can also be responsible for the disparity.

The OTA assessment proposes: (1) more consistent terminology and preservation standards' guidelines; (2) an increase in public awareness of the landscapes' value to U.S. history; (3) a federally funded research and development center; and (4) systematic, long-term maintenance of landscapes. Technologies for the identification and documentation of landscapes range from basic techniques, such as volunteers wielding  pencil and paper, to sophisticated computer systems that can assimilate, manipulate, and store geographic information and generate complicated maps of a region. OTA suggests that the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. government's leader in preservation matters, initiate greater efforts to preserve and create awareness of these landscapes.

Word processing, outlining, and hypertext software types are appraised in terms of their impact on writing processes, and, while strengths of each are noted, each is found to be limited in relation to organizing ideas, which is a critical aspect of writing in the social sciences and other areas. Software that is more salient to writing objectives requires an integration of database with word processing software. The management of &quot;ideabases&quot; is identified as the basis for a new type of software of this integrated type. Software designed by this author for classroom purposes is described. &quot;The  Writer,&quot; which is available for IBM compatible computers, allows the student or scholar to develop and work with an outline and store notes in a database that can be transferred into the final product.

        "description":"This paper examined the perceived values of children and fertility intents among college undergraduates. It described changes in the value of children by comparing data collected from students in 1986 to data obtained from a comparable group of students in 1977. The 1977 sample consisted of 341 students of whom 178 (52%) were male and 193 (48%) were females. The 1986 sample consisted of 332 students of whom 137 (41%) were male and 195 (59%) were females. Specific values of children were assessed using the Children Attitude Scales. The findings indicated that students in 1986 agreed more than students in 1977 with children providing continuity, tradition, security, and goals and incentives and agreed less with the costs of children, the need for decision-mindedness in  childbearing, and children providing social status. More changes occurred for males than females between 1977 and 1986, and a strong relationship existed between the specific values of children and number of children expected in both survey years. A pattern from both studies indicated that people who desired larger families were more likely to emphasize the positive values of children while minimizing the costs and need for decision-mindedness. An appendix provides the conceptual model, and 13 references are included. (JHP)",

        "description":"To determine where U.S. citizens receive their political and current events knowledge, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) interviewed people at a Boston shopping mall. This preliminary report, the first in a series to examine the political knowledge gap between the affluent and the economically disadvantaged, examined information dissemination through television, newspapers, and news magazines. The researchers found television to be more successful at presenting abstract and distant political issues, while print media, especially newspapers, were more successful with immediate and concrete presentation. This finding contradicts the perceptions of journalists interviewed prior to the study. It was hypothesized that television attracted people with low  initial interest and low cognitive skills while the print media is used more for information retrieval by informed citizens. To test this hypothesis, individual differences in cognitive skills and issue-interest were explored, and the results distinctly revealed television as more effective to the low interest respondents. So far, the study reflects the pattern found in other previous media studies. If the audience is cognitively skilled or highly motivated, the communication media do not make a difference. The researchers conclude that U.S. citizens do not select print or broadcast media while excluding information from other sources, and most citizens pick up ideas and information from a complex mix of media and personal discussion. A three-way analysis of variance is used to analyze  the study. Graphs and references are included. (DJC)",

A national survey sponsored by the Joint Council on Economic Education revealed that U.S. high school students tend to be ignorant of such economic concepts as gross national product, inflation, profits, and investment. According to the survey, students who complete an economics course score higher but still exhibit significant deficiencies in economic literacy. To strengthen economic knowledge, mandatory courses focusing on topics and concepts and increased preservice and inservice training  in economics education for social studies teachers are recommended. Knowledgeable teachers can effectively teach economics concepts and vary instruction to provide satisfactory understanding of concepts important for responsible citizenship. Students with a solid comprehension of basic concepts perform better as producers, consumers, investors, and voters in public elections. This improved economics education will develop more informed U.S. citizens. (DJC)",

Mentoring is seen as a nurturing process in which a more skilled and experienced person practices leadership styles that direct, coach, support, and delegate to less experienced persons for the purpose of promoting professional and personal development  within the context of a caring relationship. The Leader Behavior Description Questionnaire Form XII was administered to 212 student teachers.

The unit is the body within an institution that is primarily responsible for the preparation of teachers and other educational personnel. Units are required to focus on the knowledge bases pertinent to professional preparation and to focus on the world of professional practice. This monograph has the following purposes, to: (1) state the rationale for knowledge based curricula for teacher education; (2) describe the kinds of knowledge necessary; (3) clarify and illuminate the NCATE standards; (4) describe various institutional stategies for compliance with the standards; and (5) provoke discussion on considerations basic to teacher education  programs. Chapter 1 addresses the rationale for knowledge as a base for program definition and evolution in teacher education. The second chapter considers different kinds of knowledge that inform the design, development, and delivery of teacher education. Chapter 3 is an interpretive treatment of NCATE's knowledge base and related standards. The final chapter describes strategies and tactics that units might use to meet the knowledge base standards. Appended are other NCATE themes, knowledge base exercises, a prospectus for the beginning teacher, and NCATE standards. (JD)",

Thirty schools were randomly selected from institutions offering bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees for a total of 90 institutions. Following a long-term plan for rotating targeted respondents, professors of foundation courses and their students were surveyed. Participants in the survey included 153 professors and 729 students. Five sections elaborate on the data collected. Section one presents the context for teacher education by examining data which describe the entire institution and its education unit. The second section describes the status of current reforms in teacher education as reported by the participating  institutions. The anatomy of a program with a focus on foundations is the subject of the third section. Section four studies the education professoriate and section five, student profiles. A summary of highlights points out some encouraging findings as well as some concerns that need to be addressed. Data are displayed in tables with narrative analysis. (JD)",

A secondary purpose was to delineate factors which teachers perceive as contributing most to feelings of work-related stress. While findings revealed sex and age to be the most salient background variables bearing on teacher burnout, their influence varied with teaching level and specific facet under study.

A question is raised on the process to be used in making key decisions about the content of teacher education programs and entry into teaching. The issue of whether state agencies will continue to set the policies that determine entry into teaching or whether national teacher organizations in concert with non-public agencies will become the dominant force is discussed. The role of schools, colleges and departments of education is also examined. National teacher organizations have supported the creation of standards/practices commissions, but current pressures for creating these bodies are coming from education reform  advocates as well as state political figures. Interest in creating commissions appears to be high, and this may contribute to dramatic changes in the structure and content of teacher preparation programs. It is pointed out that opportunities to have more power in setting licensing standards and reviewing professional practices may be short-lived unless educators are perceived as capable of meeting the challenge.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine if there was any relationship between an individual teacher's preferred learning style and the amount of exhibited total stress. It also sought to determine if there was any specific area of stress which related to learning style. This was basically a replication of a study done in 1988 using a different population. Seventy-seven teachers from Northwest Georgia were administered the Wilson Stress Profile for Teachers (WSPT) and the Gregorc Transaction Ability Inventory. Data were tested by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for any relationship among learning style and stress levels. ANOVA was also used to see if there was any relationship between learning styles and individual areas of stress as measured by the WSPT. T-tests were used to see  if there was any relationship between stress levels and the abstract-concrete and the random-sequential continuum. Conclusions are: (1) that Georgia teachers as a group, are moderately to highly stressed, much more so than the 1988 study's population of Montana student teachers; (2) there is a very limited relationship, if any, between learning style and stress levels; and (3) larger sample sizes might reveal significance in the areas of interpersonal conflicts and stress management techniques.

        "description":"The New Teacher Retention Project is a collaborative partnership between San Diego State University and the San Diego Unified School District. The purposes of the project are to develop a practical model of support and assistance to new teachers, particularly those working with students from culturally diverse backgrounds, and to promote the retention of these teachers in such settings. The project involves university faculty from the arts and sciences (as well as faculty from the College of Education), along with staff development personnel, resource teachers, mentor teachers, and administrators from the school district. The project is jointly administered by the university and the school district. This paper discusses the three major components of the project: professional  development, psychological and collegial support, and scholarships and materials stipends. The process of collaboration employed in the project and insights gained through it are also discussed. (JD)",

        "description":"Two major categories of issues constitute the agenda for improving the quality of teaching. The first encompasses &quot;empowerment&quot; issues such as occupational status of teachers, their working conditions, income, incentive, and autonomy. The second addresses &quot;enablement,&quot; the knowledge, skills or abilities, and judgment requirements of teaching and the standards or criteria of performance and practice in teaching. This paper discusses a collaborative initiative which addresses both the substantive and institutional role/relationship of the &quot;enablement&quot; agenda. The partnership is between San Diego State University and the San Diego Unified School District. The initiative involves the university academic discipline faculties, teacher educators, and public school practitioners in a  comprehensive review of the entire curriculum through which students become teachers. The substantive purpose is to generate and sustain an integrated course of study for teacher education spanning the general education and major subject components of the undergraduate degree, professional preparation courses, and the first years of teaching. Three funded initiatives that are major components of this comprehensive collaboration are discussed: (1) the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education; (2) the Teacher Education Institute; and (3) the New Teacher Retention Project. The initiative is described in terms of its substance, strategies, and structures and an analysis is presented of it as a model of multiple partner collaboration. (JD)",

The school in which the program was established consisted of students who were mostly from poor and culturally diverse families. For the purpose of improving instruction, 18 teachers were &quot;paired&quot; to work together. The pairs were comprised of at least one experienced teacher and one probationary teacher. The objectives of the CCSSP were: (1) provide beginning teachers with a strong knowledge base to make them more effective; (2) train selected experienced teachers in a collegial, coaching, supervision/observation process; (3) establish a process of ongoing peer coaching, staff development and support for  teachers in the school; (4) develop a cadre of teachers and administrators who can help others apply the teacher effectiveness research; and (5) improve overall student achievement in mathematics and reading.

        "author":["Gilman, David Alan"],
        "description":"A method for improving curriculum and schools through the local development of competency tests in basic skills--the Competency-Rossville Model (CRM)--is outlined. The method was originated in the school system of Rossville (Illinois) and has been tested in five other midwestern school systems. The approach leads the faculty of the school, with the guidance of a measurement consultant, in the development of a series of grade-level tests to measure mastery in basic skills achievement. This method of test development serves to articulate the curriculum; provides a useful, relevant, and appropriate achievement testing program; and provides a management system for the improvement of basic skills instruction. The CRM is compared favorably to the norm referenced testing model. The CRM  program includes: (1) inservice instruction of faculty in an alternate model of evaluation of academic achievement; (2) a committee of school faculty formed around use of the Delphi method to confer with their fellow teachers; (3) grade-level representatives in charge of informal committees for each grade level; (4) informal teacher conferences, involving each grade level, to establish a list of skills to be mastered by students; (5) development of test items; and (6) computer-assisted interpretation of tests. This type of inservice development project has been successful in increasing faculty morale, improving basic skills instruction, and improving school achievement testing programs. The project involves faculty actively in curriculum development, results in valid and reliable tests,  and provides information that is valuable and useful to teachers. Nine figures are provided, and a sample skill-referenced math test is appended. (TJH)",

        "description":"Recent theoretical developments in cognitive psychology imply both a need and a possibility for methodological development. In particular, the theory of problem solving proposed by Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon (1972) provides the rationale for a new empirical method for the processing of think-aloud protocols--trace analysis. A detailed example is presented in which trace analysis is applied to human performance on a spatial reasoning task. The study, a portion of a larger study, involved 12 subjects who were required to solve a variety of spatial arrangement problems under different conditions. The protocol produced by a single subject--a 30-year-old female psychology student--while solving the block problems was selected for analysis on the basis of completeness and  interest. The relations between trace analysis, on the one hand, and the psychometric ideas of measurement and standardization, on the other, are discussed. A non-psychometric approach to standardized testing, referred to as &quot;theory referenced test construction,&quot; is proposed. The main premise of the approach is that test items should be validated against computer-implemented information processing models of the relevant cognitive functions. Eight figures and a 64-item list of references are provided. A computer simulation program, a bibliography of Knowledge and Understanding in Human Learning reports, and a report distribution list are appended. (TJH)",

Focus was on determining how principals and supervisors can assist: (1) teachers in identifying and alleviating the most common test construction errors found on teacher-made tests; and (2) Ohio schools in providing resources to better support teachers' testing responsibilities. A sample of 586 school supervisors and principals and 326 classroom teachers completed administrators' and teachers' versions, respectively, of an assessment of needs instrument for 45 identified competencies and of perceived proficiencies in those competencies. Administrators and teachers also rated the availability of resources  for testing and guidelines. Teachers further described their testing practices and provided a total of 175 samples of teacher-made tests. Teachers scheduled teacher-made tests frequently and used a variety of item types in making the tests; most teachers constructed their own items. Competency needs for testing were rated higher than beginning teachers' testing proficiencies by administrators. Teacher proficiency was rated highest by teachers and lowest by supervisors, with principals in the middle. Administrators and principals generally agreed on proficiency needs. Available resources appeared inadequate to support testing responsibilities. Teacher-made tests contained errors in format or construction. Guidelines and item type error formats for identifying and alleviating test  construction errors are presented, with test examples. Seven tables present study data. (SLD)",

        "description":"The use of standardized testing in secondary schools (with students between 10 and 19 years old) is described for four European countries: (1) England; (2) West Germany; (3) the Netherlands; and (4) Sweden. In the decentralized English system, several published standardized tests are available; they are used less at the secondary level than in primary grades. Tests are used for special needs assessment and educational guidance and there is some trend toward increased use of graded objectives tests. In West Germany, education is the responsibility of the states, rather than the national government. Standardized tests are not used on a population-wide basis, and the use of standardized tests is largely restricted to counseling centers and similar specialists in the schools. Neither  achievement nor intelligence tests are often used in the schools. The Netherlands created a national curriculum development center in 1975 and has created national examinations, although they are not yet widely used. Achievement tests are used by teachers only, and intelligence test use is similar to that in West Germany. In Sweden, national standardized tests based on objective techniques are used above the primary levels. In summary, it was generally found that teachers do not use standardized tests of their own accord, mostly because tests are not tailor-made for what the teachers have been teaching. Appendices present three papers summarizing recent developments in England and two aspects of the Swedish testing process. (SLD)",

The study involved selection of test items equally appropriate and useful for English- and Spanish-speaking students for use as an anchor test and the equating analysis itself. Once the items were selected, they were administered as pretests, one for each language, to determine whether the two response functions for each item were sufficiently similar for the items to be considered equivalent. On the basis of these analyses, 39 verbal and 25 mathematical items were selected for use as anchor items for equating. The anchor tests were administered at  regularly scheduled administrations of the SAT and PAA. An item response theory model was used to equate the two tests. The equating itself showed curvilinear relations in both verbal and mathematical tests, indicating that, in this instance, both sections of the PAA are easier than the corresponding SAT sections.

The SDQ, an optional part of the College Board's Admissions Testing Program, is intended to supplement the information base to improve the quality of decisions made by college admissions personnel, guidance counselors, and program planners. The 1985-86 revision of the SDQ was assessed, which features 42 rather than 63 items, a change in item format, and a sharper focus on the academic aspects of student experiences and goals. Focus was on the veracity of student responses for certain limited, verifiable forms of information and the logical or internal consistency of responses between selected item pairs within the questionnaire.  The study data were derived from 4,659 college freshmen who entered one of six universities in September of 1986. Missing-data analyses were conducted throughout the analysis of 11 item pairs. Results indicate that key items of student-reported information possess levels of accuracy that indicate the suitability of the new form for its intended purposes as well as its comparability with earlier versions of the SDQ and other student self-report questionnaires. Accuracy was particularly good in terms of grade point average, race/ethnicity and citizenship status, athletic activities, computer/math experience, and activities related to English as a second language. Eleven data tables and a chart of SDQ item contrasts for logical consistency are included. Three data tables and a list of SDQ  and Financial Aid Form items are appended. (TJH)",

However, researchers and practitioners desiring to use this criterion have been hampered by the required Monte Carlo analyses needed to develop the criteria. Two recent attempts at presenting regression estimation methods to determine eigenvalues were found to be deficient in several respects, and less accurate in general, than a simple linear interpolation of tabled random data eigenvalues. Tables are presented which permit accurate and easy determination of the parallel analysis criteria within a range of sample sizes (N=50 through 1,000) and number of variables (P=5 through 50) covered by the tables. A  total of 12,000 unique data sets was created. The generated data provided the empirical criteria for comparison of regression equation estimates using S. J. Allen and R.

        "description":"Psychological testing has played a major role in the American Psychological Association (APA) because testing and assessment are important aspects of what psychologists do; tests assist psychologists in diagnosis and treatment. From its earliest years, APA has had one or more committees concerned with testing. The present Committee on Psychological Tests and Assessment (CPTA) has played an important part in developing standards for various kinds of psychological tests. The nine-member CPTA is the only committee reporting to more than one parent board at the APA. APA recognizes the importance of testing to the public and has been instrumental in the development of the &quot;Standards for Educational and Psychological Tests.&quot; APA sponsored the meeting from which the Joint Committee on  Testing Practices (JCTP) grew. The JCTP is a means by which test publishers and professional organizations can work together to improve the use of tests in assessment and appraisal. While APA will continue to provide staff support, JCTP will better represent all testing professionals by not being dependent on any one group. The JCTP can take on projects to benefit all parties in testing, while remaining free of the controversial policy and psychometric issues APA must consider. (SLD)",

        "description":"The development of job-specific tests (JSTs) for two occupations is discussed. A reading comprehension test and a mathematical reasoning test were developed for Customs Inspectors, and a reading comprehension test was developed for Social Security Claims workers. JST items incorporated reading samples or math problems from those found on the job. Each job-specific reading test contained 40 items, and the Customs math test contained 30 items. Panels of subject matter experts rated tasks and test items. Correlational and factor analyses that related the two reading tests and the math test to cognitive or non-cognitive marker tests showed that the JSTs were cognitive tests that measured traditional verbal and mathematical abilities. Studies of the Customs tests with about 4,500 job  applicants have confirmed the high reliabilities and generally good validities of the tests. The Claims worker test was not used operationally. Effect sizes for the Black (n=about 1,000) and Hispanic (n=about 1,000) Customs Inspector applicants were all close to one standard deviation with respect to the majority White group (n=about 2,500), which is typical of group differences associated with cognitive ability test scores. Research into alternative means of examining job applicants to reduce group differences indicated that combinations of interviews and tests, one of which should be a general cognitive ability test, can reduce group differences without losing test accuracy. Three tables present study data. (SLD)",

        "description":"The use of meta-analysis in industrial and organizational psychology has become quite common. Unfortunately, the understanding and research necessary to ensure appropriate application of the technique have not been as widespread. As part of a larger study, a content analysis of meta-analyses from the industrial and organizational psychological literature was conducted to document the sample sizes--(sub i), number of studies (K), reliabilities: r(sub xx), r(sub yy); and types of meta-analyses occurring in the literature. This content analysis was used to identify the typical values associated with data sets found in meta-analyses conducted in industrial and organizational psychology. Published articles occurring from January 1980 to June 1986 in seven journals were included.  Meta-analytic papers presented at the 1984 and 1985 annual meetings of the American Psychological Association and the Academy of Management were also reviewed. A total of 81 meta-analytic studies was found; 19 were selection validation and 62 were non-validation studies. Results of the content analysis included the average reported reliabilities (R(sub xx) = 0.79, and R(sub yy) = 0.71) and the median sample size per correlation--n(sub i) = 102. Together, these two findings indicate that the literature is full of studies having low power, and that based on other research (J. M. Cornwell, 1987; E. R. Kemery, K. W. Mossholder, and L. Roth, 1987; and R. T. Ladd and J. M. Cornwell, 1986), such data may lead to biased estimates when used in a meta-analysis. Four tables and two graphs present  study data. (Author/SLD)",

Watson and L. A. Clark, 1984). A brief self-report scale was developed to assess NA. The initial 28-item scale (which included seven items each representing nervousness/calmness, self-dissatisfaction/self-satisfaction, pessimism/optimism, and cynical/trusting attitudes about other people) was administered to two separate samples of undergraduates (N=381 and N=323). Principal components analysis produced a 21-item scale, which did not include any of the cynicism/trust items. Eighty-five subjects completed the revised scale twice, with a 6-week interval. The test/retest correlation for these subjects was 0.88. The  congruent validity and discriminant validity of the scale were investigated by correlating the scale with measures of constructs hypothesized to be related or not related to NA, based on prior research. Undergraduate psychology students (N=111) participated in studies indicating that the NA scale significantly correlated with the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, the Eysenck Neuroticism Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scales, and the Eysenck Extraversion Scale. As expected, no relation was found between the NA scale and the Remote Associates Test. The NA scale did correlate with the Shipley Vocabulary Subscale, although no explanation is offered for this correlation. One table presents item-scale correlations for the two original samples.

The average score on the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) and undergraduate science grade point averages (GPAs) were used as predictors. The three steps required to produce the nomogram were: (1) develop a predictor model for NBME-I performance based on MCAT scores and GPAs; (2) develop an expectancy table for success on the NBME-I based on this model; and (3) create a  nomogram from the prediction model and the expectancy tables. Actual computations and graphing of the nomogram were done with a spreadsheet-graphics package called &quot;Quattro.&quot; Such nomograms are effective tools for presenting the expectancy of success based on two predictors in an easily used form.

The findings from the investigation support the conclusions of other researchers that teachers need more training in testing skills and that pre-service training in testing skills may not be meeting the needs of classroom teachers. Both supervisors and principals rated beginning teachers' proficiencies lower than they rated the teachers' need for these skills in order to perform successfully in the classroom. Supervisors and principals rather consistently agreed with each other about the  level of the teachers' testing proficiencies and the level of the needs of the various testing skills to assure teaching success. Neither teachers' mastery nor competency testing program needs or proficiency ratings differed significantly when they were classified by school setting (rural, urban, and suburban); however, both teachers' needs and proficiencies for standardized testing program ratings differed significantly when the teachers and administrators were classified by their grade level responsibilities (elementary, middle, and secondary).

Its design serves two purposes: (1) a normative measure of student achievement; and (2) an objective-based measurement of curriculum coverage. The test's curricular validity, content validity, instructional validity, item pool content validity, standardization sample, and concurrent validity are discussed. The measurement of student achievement is attained by administering a set of items based on a core of objectives and a set of variable objectives (one item per objective tested). This test design was necessitated by a large number of objectives to be covered in a limited administration time. The measurement of curriculum is met by the  same set of items that cover the entire range of objectives taught in the Algebra II course of instruction. Four unique forms of the test (Forms B through E) have been developed to afford a broad curriculum coverage. Normative student scores are based on the 56-item total score. Curriculum assessment is achieved by combining the results from all forms of the test administered at one time--a total of 224 items. This booklet is designed to facilitate proper use of test scores by describing the curricular and psychometric characteristics of the test. Methods for deriving scores, reliability, test norms, test content, and curricular assessment are discussed. Twenty-six graphs and four tables are presented.

        "description":"An Educational Testing Service (ETS) procedure was evaluated, which is based on item response theory and estimates true scores on tests not taken. The reading, vocabulary, and mathematics tests of high school seniors from the National Longitudinal Study (NLS) of 1972 and the High School and Beyond (HSB) seniors of 1980 and 1982 were found to share common blocks of items but differ in terms of total test length and overall difficulty. As the common blocks were too short to permit reliable comparisons, LOGIST was used to simultaneously estimate the item and person parameters for all three cohorts. The estimate of a student's ability (theta) based on the achievement test taken was combined with the item parameters for a test not taken. Thus, a number-right true score or &quot;estimated  number-right score&quot; was obtained for a 1982 HSB senior on a 1972 NLS mathematics test. Since the group's expected true score equaled its expected number-right score, the desired cohort comparisons across time could be made. In an evaluation of this method, which generates hypothetical true scores based on tests not actually taken, comparable test forms (X and Y) of varying common block size were simulated for three conditions. Two hundred simulated examinees each for the three conditions were used. For each simulated examinee, the probability of a correct response was computed for each item. Comparisons of simulated true scores with true scores based on LOGIST estimates were made for both the tests taken and the hypothetical tests not taken. Results indicate that the ETS method should  remain experimental. (TJH)",

A total of 32 members of test committees who write examination items for various medical specialty examinations participated in the study. Each participant was provided with a list of phrases used in multiple-choice items to express some concept related to frequency of occurrence. Participants were asked to indicate what percentage of time was reflected by each phrase and to express this percentage both as a single number (i.e., 75% of the time) and as a band (i.e., 60 to 80% of the time). The list included 15 terms. Responses of two participants were deleted due to excessive  aberrance. Results indicate that the phrases used by item writers to express frequency do not have an operational definition that is commonly shared. Both the single values and phrases varied considerably across individuals. Problems created by vague terms are much more severe for true/false type items than for one-best answer items.

A group of approximately 20 faculty members of five New England medical schools met in Worcester for half of a day to develop pattern recognition items. Teams of four to six physicians were assigned to work on particular topic areas that represent common chief complaints of patients. They developed a list of approximately 15 common diagnoses that relate to each of the topics. An item describing a patient by listing critical signs and symptoms was developed for each of the diagnoses. Approximately 300 items divided into 21 sets were developed and, subsequently, edited and reviewed by independent physicians before test administration. A modified  Angoff procedure was used to set pass/fail standards for the set of items. A total of 336 fourth-year medical students from the five schools were tested using the items. The 21 sets of pattern recognition items were completed by between 112 and 332 examinees. Results indicate that: (1) students performed well on the items--the mean score was 82% correct, and almost 66% of the students passed at least 90% of the sets they took; (2) generalizability analyses indicated that performance in one topic area did not predict performance in other areas very well; and (3) 2 hours of testing time would be required to generate a reasonably reliable score.

The way CAI determines background knowledge of a student, presents information necessary to learn new concepts, sets its pace according to student needs, reinforces previous learning, and evaluates student performance qualifies it as an expert system. Developmental stages covered include: (1) conceptualization (development of project rationale); (2) design (development of behavioral objectives, choice of a learning theory, selection of content and instructional models, development of means of sequencing instruction and presenting materials, student support requirements,  measurement of student performance, selection of computer language/program, development of means of selecting an &quot;authoring system,&quot; and validation of design); and (3) implementation (coding in suitable author language, testing of the system to determine whether it meets product specifications, determination of overall instructional value of the CAI system, and marketing).

Israeli adolescents who neither work nor study are considered to be disattached. These youth are eventually absorbed into a variety of both voluntary and involuntary community residential educational and resocialization programs. Data on the characteristics of more than 3,600 youths who had been enrolled in one of 57 programs were gathered from the institutions themselves, social service agencies, the Police Authorities, and the Israeli Defense Forces. These data were analyzed to explain a youth's post-institutional delinquency and military performance as a function of both individual characteristics and the attributes of the program  or institution with which the youth had been involved. Summary findings include the following: (1) there were few differences among the youth enrolled in the various programs; (2) the programs varied widely in organizational and programmatic attributes; (3) youths were neither more nor less delinquent after having attended most of the programs than before; and (4) there were few reliable program effects on military performance. Alternatives to the current approaches are discussed. Statistical data are presented on 21 tables. A list of 100 references is also appended.

The Prekindergarten program serves educationally and developmentally disadvantaged 3- and 4-year olds residing in low-income areas. This study followed 171 pupils who had been in the program in the 1982-83 school year, and who remained in the Wichita school system through 1986-87. Data were drawn from standardized test scores, records of parent contacts with school personnel and social workers, and the results of a survey of parent attitudes. Summary findings include the following: (1) half of the participants required an average of 1.5 years of additional Chapter  1 reading and mathematics services after leaving prekindergarten; (2) those participants who required more than two years of continued Chapter 1 services usually required mathematics in grades 1 and 2, and reading in grades 3 and 4; (3) retention rates for participants were slightly higher than those for the total district in grade 1, but were comparable by grade 3; (4) a higher percentage of participants were placed in special education classrooms than the general district population; and (5) there were no significant differences in the academic achievement of program participants in the second and third grades when compared to pupils from similar socioeconomic areas.

        "author":["Larsen, Janet"],
        "description":"Federal housing programs since the 1960's have provided subsidies for nearly two million privately-owned rental housing units to make them affordable for low-income people. Since taking office, the Reagan administration has focused the little attention it has given to low-income housing on person-based subsidies, and has reduced funding levels to nearly zero for programs that have provided the existing stock of affordable housing. Restrictions regarding the affordability and acceptable use of units, or &quot;use controls,&quot; were imposed on owners who received federal subsidies. These use controls were attached to a time line, however, and many units are now approaching a point where the owners will have the option of terminating the restrictions on their properties. Because of this,  Minnesota's entire stock of existing federally assisted privately owned low-income rental housing, a stock that exceeds 49,000 units, will be lost in the next 50 years. Under a best-case scenario, 52 percent of those units with Section 8 contracts will lose their assistance within 20 years. In addition, within 30 years use controls on 42 percent of those units receiving mortgage assistance will expire. Under a worst case scenario, 82 percent of the units covered by mortgage assistance contracts, and 99 percent of those units covered by Section 8 contracts will see their controls terminated within the next 20 years. Tables and figures illustrate the data. Appendices (the bulk of the document) provide the following: (1) owner motivations for prepaying mortgages or opting out of rental  assistance agreements; (2) text of Title II, the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987; (3) program descriptions; (4) data elements included in the Minnesota Housing Project database; (5) units lost per year: mortgage subsidies and rental assistance; (6) assisted units in Minnesota by county and agency; (7) Minnesota projects eligible for prepayment, 1988-98; and (8) complete listing of all federally assisted low-income housing in Minnesota.

Approximately 30 percent of all elementary and secondary students in 1982 were economically, linguistically, and/or culturally disadvantaged. Their number and their degree of disadvantage has been increasing rapidly due to immigration. The consequences to the United States of ignoring the needs of these students are the following: (1) reduced economic competitiveness; (2) higher costs of public services; (3) massive disruption in higher education; and (4) the emergence of a dual society with a large and poorly educated underclass. Most current state educational reforms, such as increasing academic standards, raising teachers' salaries, or increasing the  amount of time in school, do not specifically meet the needs of the educationally disadvantaged, and may even increase dropout rates among that population. A national agenda for directly addressing these needs must include the following: (1) goals; (2) accountability; (3) resources; and (4) the responsibilities of students, parents, communities, schools and state education agencies, colleges and universities, business and industry, states, and the federal government.

Schools or school districts have successfully collaborated with businesses, unions, schools of higher education, hospitals, youth agencies, community organizations, and local governments to solve mutual problems. Collaborative goals may be categorized as either school improvement goals, such as decreasing the dropout rate, or fundamental change goals, such as obtaining a greater voice for the minority poor served by the schools. Participation in collaboratives may be described as either open, small group, or ritualized. Aspects of successful collaborations include the following: (1)  commitment; (2) clarity about roles; (3) training; (4) incentives for institutionalization; and (5) evaluation. Since collaboratives can provide powerful support for many types of intervention, it is ultimately up to educators to decide which interventions are most effective, and then to create appropriate collaboratives to implement them. However, independent public school improvement is needed to sustain the interest and support of the participating community groups. (FMW)",

As with other academic/punitive measures, poor Blacks and Hispanics tend to be retained disproportionate to their numbers because minorities are likely to be perceived as low-achieving and/or troublesome students. Negative effects of retention include the following: (1) no short- or long-term improvement in academic achievement; (2) stigma; (3) low self-esteem; (4) lack of interest in extracurricular activities; (5) waning motivation; and (6) increased chance of dropping out at a later age. Retention has been found to be beneficial when used with immature elementary students in  the early grades, who are not opposed to being retained, and whose parents support the decision. Student characteristics to consider in determining retention include the following: (1) chronological age; (2) present grade; (3) knowledge of English; (4) previous retentions; (5) age/grade difference between siblings; (6) estimate of intelligence; (7) history of learning disabilities; and (8) attitude toward retention.

Highlights of the findings include the following: (1) at least five different types of low-income households were identified; (2) low-income people resemble the general population in that they span all ages, are mostly white, but they are slightly more likely to be female than the general population; (3)  low-income people differ from the general population in that they are more likely to be under age 25 or over age 65, less likely to have graduated from high school, and much more likely to be single and living alone or single and living with children; and (4) the biggest problems facing low-income people stem from inability to pay for adequate housing, utilities, basic necessities, and medical care. Statistical data are included on three graphs and one table. (Author/FMW)",

        "description":"Social and economic forces in the post-war era have lead to an increased commitment by women of all ages to the labor force. In contrast, the labor force participation rate for men has declined. With women's continued predominance in the service sector and jobs lost in the traditionally male manufacturing sector of the U.S. economy, men and women are being affected differently by changes in macroeconomic trends. Within and across industries, women are still concentrated in clerical, sales, service, and light manufacturing jobs. Women made minor gains moving into management and the professions, but mostly into predominantly female categories and/or low-paying jobs. Although these gains have been somewhat higher for younger women, the evidence is inconclusive as to whether these  advances will continue over their working lives and for succeeding generations. Even where occupational desegregation by sex has occurred, men and women in the same occupation continue to work in different establishments or departments and have different pay scales. Median incomes are inversely related to the percentage of females in an occupation; internal labor markets can be used as a lens to evaluate the extent of sex segregated career tracking and the disproportion of men at the top of the career ladder, even in female-dominated occupations. The wage gap has not declined despite women's increased education, experience, and tenure because women face different opportunity structures than do men. Policy options are recommended. Data are presented on 22 tables and figures. A 47-item list  of references is included. (Author/ BJV)",

        "description":"The lack of student discipline continues to be a major concern among educators and the general public. A researcher-developed opinion survey concerning the frequency of, sources of, and interventions for student misbehavior was completed by a sample of 312 students and 106 teachers from four private American-type schools located in Caracas, Valencia, and Maracaibo, Venezuela. Their responses were subjected to a series of one-way analyses of variance to determine if significant differences of opinion existed among the following groups: (1) female and male students; (2) 7th, 9th, and 11th graders; and (3) students and teachers. The female students and ninth graders perceived that student misbehavior occurs significantly more frequently than the other student sub-groups, but no such  difference existed between the composite student group and the teachers. Although no significant differences regarding misbehavior sources or interventions were detected among the student sub-groups, the composite student group differed significantly from the teachers regarding both sources and interventions for student misbehavior. The need for increased emphasis on student participation in defining and implementing discipline policies and replicating the study with a more heterogeneous population sample were the major recommendations of the study.

Twenty-four females and 16 males completed a Student Demographic Questionnaire (SDQ) and the Personal Competency Rating Scale (PCI).

A follow-up study of student enrollment  status was performed immediately after the first semester of the participants' fourth academic year. Analysis was performed to determine the relationships among the following factors: (1) perceived personal competencies; (2) first-year grade point average (GPA); and (3) academic persistence over the four-year period. Findings indicate that those students who obtained higher freshman GPAs, and who perceived themselves as being more personally competent, tended to persist academically.

Multiple regression analyses were employed to find the contribution of the belief in a just world  and perceived personal competencies to the variability within feelings of alienation from the university. Results indicated that black students who had accepted white middle-class values and tended to believe in a just world expressed feelings of alienation to a lesser degree than those who had not. Such students also tended to perceive themselves as more competent overall than those who believed in a just world to a lesser extent.

The program focused on developing more effective strategies for school-university collaboration in preparing students to teach effectively a racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse student population. The report is divided into three parts. Part A, &quot;Project Portrayal,&quot; describes and evaluates the program, which inaugurates significant alterations in the following aspects of the traditional teacher education program: (1) organizational structure (creation of a student cohort, use of three &quot;clinical training sites&quot;); (2) instructional roles (creation of position, &quot;clinical teacher-supervisor&quot;); and  (3) preservice curriculum (emphasis on multicultural education). The evolution of the program is outlined, and major issues, strategies, and collaboration approaches discussed. The following major outcomes are discussed: (1) collaboration as a school, university, and community activity; (2) integration of school and university-based teacher education; (3) support systems at the school and university level; (4) integration of multicultural education into university and field-based curriculum and instructional strategies; (5) the role of the clinical teacher supervisor; and (6) the effects of the cohort group.

The public-private partnerships that have emerged at the local community level and the strong leadership role assumed by the private sector representatives on the State Job Training Coordinating Councils and Private Industry Councils have been particularly instrumental in the overall success of JTPA. Available information indicates that JTPA is indeed helping those in need of its services--disadvantaged persons, dislocated workers, Native Americans, migrant and seasonal farmworkers, Job Corps participants, and veterans--and making a significant difference in their lives. The introduction of performance standards in JTPA has made it more efficient than  previous efforts and has increased its acceptance by the public. Efforts to link JTPA with public assistance programs, economic development activities, and education, as well as creative attempts to assist hard-to-serve individuals, should receive Congressional support. This position paper includes 20 pages of specific recommendations concerning the overall implementation of JTPA, training services for disadvantaged adults and summer youth programs, dislocated worker programs, federally administered programs, and JTPA implementation in Puerto Rico. A nine-page bibliography and appendixes on JTPA programs in Puerto Rico, JTPA funding, program participation, and performance standards are appended. (MN)",

Other witnesses were representatives of the National Association of Women Business Owners and of groups such as nonprofit economic development corporations. The witnesses' testimony centered on the difficulties women entrepreneurs face in starting businesses, gaining access to capital, working through Small Business Administration (SBA) red tape, and trying to win bids for government contracts. Testimony supported legislative ideas for setting up  commissions on women, for making federal contracts more accessible, and for persuading banks to end discrimination. It was also pointed out that corporations and the country as a whole are missing a vital force for economic development by denying some women the chance to move up in their firms. Testimony supported easier access to the SBA, more government contracts for women-owned businesses, and stronger antidiscrimination regulations. (KC)",

Research methodology involved conducting an assessment of available data, obtaining information from individuals involved in JTPA, and preparing a baseline report. The study found various degrees of use of instructional applications of this technology in the four JTPA programs studied: in Title IIA, computers are used for both instructional management and computer-assisted instruction especially when serviced by large school districts or national service providers; in Title IIB,  computer-assisted instruction is used more often than computer-managed instruction; in Title III Dislocated Worker programs, computer-related technology is seldom used; and under Title IV, computers are being used to provide at least some education or occupational training in more than 90 percent of all Job Corps centers. Barriers to effective use of computers in JTPA include lack of information, funding contraints, lack of staff development, lack of software designed for adults, and the school-JTPA relationship. Recommendations were made to create investment funding mechanisms to set up computer equipment and to create a national technology resource center.

        "description":"Job success and steady work are more important to students today than making a lot of money; moreover, the values students place on job success, steady work, and making money diminish as students progress through high school and enter college and the world of work. These findings are based on the longitudinal study High School and Beyond (HS&amp;B), sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics. Estimates are based on responses to questionnaires by HS&amp;B high school sophomores in 1980 and on responses to follow-up questionnaires in 1982, 1984, and 1986. Some of the highlights of the study are as follows: (1) about 82 percent of students rate job success and steady work as being very important; (2) about 33 percent rate making a lot of money as very important; (3) the 1980  high school sophomore group is more concerned than a 1972 national group with being well-off financially and with making a lot of money; (4) the importance students place on these job-related goals declines as the students grow older; and (5) high school graduates and college students are more likely than high school dropouts to say that job success and steady work are important. The study includes comparisons by subcategories such as race/ethnicity and gender; the report contains extensive statistical data. (KC)",

The materials provide students with information about immigration, how immigrants fit into the economic system and society, and how different cultures and races have evolved. Goals are to give students the opportunity to relate this information to their own lives and to provide language exercises. The six chapters are: &quot;They Broke My Car Window!&quot; (prejudice, stereotypes, poverty, homeless persons, migrant farm workers, the elderly, the unemployed, crime and ghetto life); Common Ground (values, feelings, and experiences in common); &quot;What's He So Angry About?&quot; (slavery, segregation and discrimination, civil rights movement); &quot;We're All in the Same Boat  Now!&quot; (history of immigration, immigrants); Why We Look and Live the Way We Do (race, culture); and &quot;I Got a Job! But...&quot; (helping or hurting each other, unions and safety, words for work). Each chapter contains a dialogue that sets the theme; questions on comprehension and for oral discussion; a picture series for use as oral practice in telling a connected narrative; and reading, vocabulary, and listening exercises. The teacher's guide at the end of each chapter provides answers to exercises, instructions for accomplishing certain exercises, and suggestions on how to present certain exercises. (YLB)",

They fail because they are often top-down driven and few influential people are involved. Minnesota's Project Future is designed to help distressed communities take charge of their own direction. Developed on the principle of collective empowerment, this coordinated, interdisciplinary education, research, and technical service aids communities in looking to the future and implementing a community-based plan for renewal. Anticipatory management, future studies, civic education, behavior modification, and economic development coalesce in the program. In the project's four steps, (1) the community defines itself and citizen members choose to renew the community; (2) people of the community  are engaged; (3) citizens participate in problem solving; and (4) self-renewal is continued. Results of the experience with five pilot sites in 1988 indicate that local residents are more active in community issues, more positive about the future, and more aware of community problems. The role of the adult educator in this process should be that of a change agent and advisor. He/she must be committed to long-term nurturing for community empowerment and community problem solving. Adult educators need to be futurists. (Sample program materials are appended.) (YLB)",

Self-reported data were used to identify the two groups. The analysis found that members of the low educational achievement and handicapped populations differ from the average postsecondary student in a number of ways, but in terms of their current educational pursuits, the differences are minimal. Students in the disadvantaged groups are older,  disproportionately male, and from lower income families. Similarly, major differences in high school background exist; the disadvantaged groups had lower grades, were more likely to have pursued the general curriculum, and put in less effort into extracurricular activities and homework. Nevertheless, these persons' current grades are only slightly lower than average; they are not any more likely than the average student to have taken developmental education classes; and they have similar attitudes and effort toward their current programs. Finally, the study found that on average, postsecondary institutions are serving disadvantaged populations fairly well, but they need to provide more training for their teachers in working with disadvantaged populations.

It examines the demographic and educational background characteristics of the faculty, job conditions, perceptions of institutional policies and mission priorities, and perceptions of student characteristics. It also develops and tests models of salaries, instructional methods, and organizational outcomes to demonstrate causal relationships that administrators and policymakers may find useful for implementing change. Data were obtained from a survey of postsecondary occupational education institutions conducted by the National Center for Research in Vocational Education. The study found that the factors that most influence  instructional methods are institutional characteristics, class size and adequacy of materials/equipment, perceptions of institutional mission, and education and training of instructors. The institution's salary/personnel policies are not related to instructional methods. The factors that best explain organizational outcomes include perceptions of students, perceptions of the institution's salary policies, instructional methods, experience of the instructor, and job characteristics. Institutional characteristics, institutional mission perceptions, and educational backgrounds of the instructors do not seem to influence organizational outcomes. Salaries are determined by institutional factors, job characteristics, and personal characteristics. (KC)",

The statistically valid random sample consisted of 347 small businesses, 319 large businesses, and 54 public sector employers. The major finding was that vocational education programs and graduates have solid employer support in South Dakota. A large share of employers had interacted with the vocational education system in some manner, for example, cooperative work experience programs, input in curricular decisions, or donations of equipment. Small businesses tended to be more positive toward  vocational education than large businesses. A second major finding was the systematic differences between vocationally and nonvocationally trained workers. The employers praised cooperative work experience programs highly, showed strong support of the basic skill attainment of vocational education students, paid vocationally trained workers higher wages, and promoted them more quickly. Respondents made favorable remarks about certain programs but were critical of others. Several felt that courses should be developed and offered in specialized program areas. (YLB)",

        "description":"The study used data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress report to examine the relationship for young adults between functional literacy skills and educational attainment. Educational attainment was classified into four categories: less than a high school graduate, high school graduate, some postsecondary education, and college graduate. On the average, dropouts had lower literacy skills than high school graduates. There was a large increase in literacy skills for college graduates compared with high school graduates. Comparison of educational attainment and race/ethnicity showed that the literacy skills of Blacks and Hispanics were lower than those of Whites within each educational level. Additional analysis of literacy skills was done for White young adults by  further subdividing some of the groupings. (The sample of Blacks and Hispanics was too small to permit further breakdown.) The literacy skills of high school equivalency certificate recipients were similar to those of high school graduates on two of three scales, but lower on the third scale. Among young adults completing at least two years of college, those currently enrolled in school had higher literacy skills than those not enrolled. The literacy scores of college students completing two or more years and currently enrolled were equivalent to the scores of graduates of four-year colleges. (YLB)",

        "description":"The State of New Jersey has proposed moving its competency test of basic skills from the 9th to the 11th grade, in order to allow for more content learning, more maturity, and more test-taking skills on the part of students. Since vocational students are more likely than other students to score low on the basic skills competency test, having the test later has both good and bad consequences for these students. Students who take the test later should be more mature, have taken more vocational courses, and have survived the age-16 dropout plateau. However, students who fail the later test have less time for remediation in order to pass the test in grade 12 and graduate. Recommendations are made for early testing to serve as an &quot;early warning&quot; for those students most likely to fail  the basic skills test and for remediation measures for those who fail early tests. Other recommendations for vocational education in New Jersey include open entry/open exit programs, mastery measured by competency rather than time spent, inclusion of basic skills in all vocational courses, and training for teachers in integrating reading, writing, and mathematics instruction in vocational courses.

        "description":"A study analyzed the implementation, impact, and cost-effectiveness of an on-the-job training (OJT) program for recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) in New Jersey, operated as part of the state's Work Incentive (WIN) Demonstration system. Enrollees in the program, mostly female single heads of household, were placed with employers for six months of training, with half their wages paid by the state for the trial period. They were to be hired after the six months if they worked satisfactorily. New Jersey used a process known as welfare grant diversion to finance the wage subsidies. An experimental group and a group of similar women who did not participate in the program were compared. The study found that approximately 200 people were placed in jobs, with  slightly more than half completing the subsidy period. All but one of those completing the subsidized period were retained as unsubsidized employees. The OJT program led to substantial employment gains in the first two quarters after random assignment; the gains then declined sharply. The OJT program completers earned 22 percent higher wages than average for the control group. The OJT group spent fewer months on AFDC and received $265 less in welfare payments in the first year after the experiment. The study concluded that the program could be expected to pay for itself within about two and one-half years, with savings thereafter, and it benefitted those enrolled in it. (KC)",

A number of issues have emerged as the focus of literacy education has shifted from improving social mobility to providing employment-related literacy programs. Some of these issues are related to the need for more resources for workplace literacy programs. Several aspects of issues related to resources are: emphasis on improving the basic skills of the unemployed rather than individuals in the current work force and lack of resources that serve adequately both the general and employment-related literacy needs of all adults. Another set of issues surrounding workplace literacy programs has to do with their content or curriculum. They include determination of what skills  should be taught, choice of teaching methods, and the narrow focus of many workplace literacy programs.

In the traditionally male programs of agricultural, technical, and trade and industry education, the number and percentage of female students had increased. The growth was primarily due to increased enrollment of women in such traditional programs as cosmetology (categorized in trade and industry) and in data processing (technical), although increases were documented in such trade and industry areas as commercial photography, drafting, graphic arts, and law enforcement. The traditionally female areas of occupational home economics and office occupations showed an  increase in male student enrollment. Despite the advances in nontraditional enrollments, women and men who enroll in nontraditional programs faced a number of problems, including sex bias and stereotyping; harassment; lack of support by family, school personnel, and peers; lack of guidance programs; lack of role models; and job placement.

        "description":"Existing theories of career development are based primarily on observations of white, middle-class males. This has prompted consideration of a separate theory of career development for women. Before a separate theory can be justified, it must be established that sex differences in the career development process do exist. A study attempted to determine if sex differences exist in the relationships among, and relative strengths of, a set of variables in a causal model of career maturity. High school students recruited from study halls in two school systems in rural and suburban areas of southwestern Virginia were administered short tests and a questionnaire. Data were collected from 156 male and 162 female students in grades 10-12. Ninety percent of the students were Caucasian, and  the majority came from middle and upper middle class families. Students' parents also were surveyed. The set of variables measured included background variables such as family climate and locus of control. The results of the study suggest that the development of career maturity differs in subtle ways for males and females. For males, the single most important determinant of career attitudes was age: the older a boy becomes the more ready he is to make career decisions. Although this tends to be true for females as well, age is not as important as a sense of family cohesion and an internal locus of control. (KC)",

This study used a repeated measures design to correct for this problem. College students (N=158) completed Maiden's Metamemory Scale, a questionnaire which tests self-knowledge of preferred strategic encoding style. On the basis of their performance on this scale, 19 subjects were identified as verbalizers and 12 subjects were identified as imagers. These 31 subjects who showed a clear preference for either verbal or spatial encoding strategies were asked to remember two short  stories using their preferred and non-preferred strategy. Both instructions and story order were randomly assigned. The results indicated that individual differences in encoding styles and metamemory for these encoding styles existed. Traditional models of memory were unable to adequately explain the findings.

Because the family plays such an important role in the development of responsible autonomy, this study examined authoritative parenting and the hypothesis that authoritative parents promote school success. Subjects were 157 working- and middle-class families with a first-born child between the ages of 11 and 16 who was enrolled in the public schools. Families completed a measure of the extent and degree of the adolescent's involvement in 10 different household responsibilities; a checklist concerning 17 areas of decision-making on a variety of day-to-day issues used to assess the nature of the family's decision-making  style; and adolescents' characterizations of their parents' warmth and use of psychological control. Schools provided information on the adolescents' grades, attendance, and standardized achievement test scores. The results revealed that the adolescents obtained higher grades and attended school more often when their parents used democratic, rather than authoritarian, decision-making practices; when their parents were warm; and when their parents were not overly controlling psychologically. Adolescents from authoritative households (as opposed to either authoritarian or permissive households) performed better in school than their peers, even after controlling for social class and achievement test scores. School grades and attendance records examined one year after the study suggest that  authoritative parenting actually promotes school success among high school students. (NB)",

The research reviewed illustrates the complexity of the problem and of the many variables that may affect outcome. The review suggests that a social influences approach to drug prevention that focuses on preventing the initiation of use by reducing the influence of peer pressure will have limited effectiveness by itself, especially with alcohol. It suggests that more attention must be given to problem users and to reducing underlying behavioral problems, and that prevention efforts must begin earlier than junior high school. It notes that prevention efforts effective for one drug may not be effective for another and that prevention of alcohol drinking among adolescents poses a whole  set of different problems from tobacco or illicit drug use. Finally, the research reviewed suggests that school-based programs rooted in psychosocial principles can be successful, and that credible information dissemination can have a positive impact. Broader action on the community level is urged. Following the review are abstracts of 12 studies, all published in 1988, which deal with the evaluation of curricula and school-based drug prevention programs, correlates and consequences of adolescent drug use, or surveys of attitudes and perceptions concerning drug use.

Data were obtained from the June 1985 Marital and Fertility History Supplement to the Current Population Survey. Subjects consisted of 11,484 married, 3,854 widowed, and 1,994 divorced women with adult children. The results revealed that for middle-aged women (those under age 60), there were only slight differences between marital status groups; approximately one-half of the women in each group coresided with an adult child. For older women (aged 60 and older), widows were more likely than married women to be residing with an adult child. Widows and divorcees did not differ substantially in the likelihood of coresidence with adult children;  slightly more than 25% of the women in each group resided with an adult child. Further analyses revealed that age, recency of marital disruption, and type of marital disruption all played a role in the women's patterns of coresidence with adult children. Cases of coresidence involving daughters rather than sons were more likely among divorced than widowed women in both age groups. Divorced women were more likely than widows to share a residence in which they were not the household head. The results suggest that when the type of marital disruption occurs \"off-time\" (widowhood in middle age, divorce in old age), women are especially likely to depend on adult offspring for support through coresidence.

Subjects were 301 community-dwelling elderly persons who were age 65 or older and in good physical and mental health. Subjects were interviewed three times; depression was assessed by the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, perceived social support was assessed by the Social Provisions Scale, and the networks of social relationships that provided respondents with each of the social provisions were assessed through personal interviews. The results revealed that perceived  qualitative social support had a significant negative effect on later depression. Qualitative social support also was significantly correlated with initial levels of depression. Perceptions of being supported in ways such as through social integration, reassurance of one's worth, guidance from others, assistance from others, and the opportunity to nurture others had an important effect on whether or not an elderly subject became depressed. Findings support the contention that some minimum quantity of support is necessary to provide the qualities of support. Furthermore, quantitative social network characteristics, density and number of kin, predicted depression in the elderly over and above their effects on the perceived qualitative aspects of support.

This waiting period may be a highly stressful time for individuals anticipating relocation. This study explored relocating older adults' (N=63) coping strategies and the impact of these strategies on health, cognitive functioning, and well being. Older adults awaiting relocation to subsidized, age-segregated apartments were interviewed prior to relocation; 54 respondents were interviewed again 9 to 12 months later when approximately one-half of the subjects had moved. Interviews focused on the effects and meaning of the anticipatory period on health, functioning, morale, attitudes, and daily activities. The results support the hypothesis that respondents who appraised  relocation as stressful would use different coping strategies than respondents who perceived the experience to be non-stressful. The former subgroup was more likely to use emotion-focused techniques. Among subjects who were still anticipating relocation at the time of the second interview, emotion-focused techniques were used more often than were problem-focused techniques. Relocated and non-relocated subjects did not differ in terms of their use of emotion-focused techniques. Most respondents used multiple techniques to cope with relocation. No one technique was found to be superior to others, or to facilitate higher morale or psychological well-being, although the use of problem-focused strategies was predictive of health and adjustment among the relocated respondents. Subjects appeared  to employ complex coping strategies with a high rate of success. (NB)",

        "description":"One of the best ways to produce affordable housing is to address the needs of a group that has too much housing. A baby boom generation generates an empty nester boom. An empty nester boom means dramatic underutilization of the housing stock. If a small percentage of homeowners were to install an accessory apartment, they would have a significant effect on the availability of housing. These apartments would typically rent at below market rates for comparable units. Another choice for making better use of housing is shared housing, in which a matching agency helps the homeowner find a compatable person to share the home in return for rent and/or services to the homeowner. Echo homes in which a separate, age-appropriate small home is temporarily installed in the side or rear yard  of the home of an adult child and is used by an aging parent is another way to to make single family housing more productive. Accessory apartments, shared housing, and echo housing are collectively known as alternative living arrangements. Because of the housing needs of the elderly, aging organizations have often been the strongest advocates of these types of alternative living arrangements. Alternative housing can allow the elderly to plan ahead, before they become frail, to age in a familiar place. An educational campaign about alternative living arrangements can both help the elderly and provide housing for others. An educational campaign should cost much less than the construction of new housing units. (ABL)",

        "description":"This report examines the relationship between affective variables and academic success among high-risk college freshmen. It summarizes research conducted on the impact of student goals, learning styles, mathematics and test anxiety, other sources of stress, and level of development on achievement among Developmental Studies students. Results are reported showing that: (1) Developmental Studies students who placed a higher priority on academic reasons for attending the institution earned higher grades during their first quarter in the program; (2) Developmental Studies students were likely to prefer a hands-on learning style and learning through interaction and visual stimuli rather than through lecture and text; (3) stress and other variables may account for a greater proportion  of variance in first quarter grades than does high school grade point average or Scholastic Aptitude Test scores; and (4) counseling can have a positive effect on developmental tasks. The report concludes that affective variables are significantly related to performance among Developmental Studies freshmen and that admissions decisions must consider student self-concept and motivational issues. Administrators and faculty members who serve high-risk populations are encouraged to consider individual student needs and to be willing to use various teaching strategies to communicate ideas to these students. The value of a counseling component in developmental/remedial education programs is emphasized. Three pages of references are included; 13 tables and 3 figures are appended. (NB)",

For mid-career professionals, the maintenance of professional competence becomes a major concern. This study examined the personal and institutional characteristics that are associated with being professionally competent and up-to-date in certain academic fields and the salience of certain personality characteristics in differentiating between mid-career college faculty members who are more versus less up-to-date with regard to their academic field. Subjects were faculty members (N=105) at 2- and 4-year colleges. The primary responsibility of these faculty members was teaching rather than research. They represented the  fields of engineering (N=28) and English (N=77). Subjects participated in a 1-hour interview and completed a personality questionnaire and a professional currency measure. Results showed professional competence was most directly related to the activities of the faculty members, rather than to personal and institutional characteristics. Reading of professional journals was a major mechanism for maintaining professional currency for both English and engineering faculty. Involvement in professional organizations was associated with being more professionally current. Time spent in research and publishing was positively related to professional currency in teaching responsibilities. Current faculty members perceived achievement to be a more salient characteristic or need than less current  subjects. (ABL)",

The basic approach to serving students is adjusted by lengthening the school day, developing a student support services team, implementing direct services to at-risk students, and utilizing mobile or part-time teachers to reduce class size. Other program components include counseling, emphasis on prevention, mentoring, and networking of school and community resources. Support personnel are most directly involved in the program, but all school personnel are involved in the comprehensive concept. Students benefit by improved self-concept, monitoring of risk factors, attention to  individual learning styles, and involvement in extra-curricular activities. School staff benefit from reduced class size and paper work, positive partnerships with teachers, and improved morale. The school system benefits from a reduced dropout rate, improved attendance, and positive school climate. Financial needs are estimated to be $15,000 to $30,000 per year.

Counselor educators are encouraged to incorporate computer competence into their curriculum. This report is divided into four parts. First, there is a brief discussion of the concept of computer competence which emphasizes that it is really computer fluency that counselor educators should be after as an attribute for their graduates. Next, there is an overview of five common computer applications (word processing, electronic spreadsheets, database management, desktop publishing, and electronic telecommunications/data communications). The Council for the Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational  Programs (CACREP) curricular areas are presented with suggestions for computer assignments within each of these areas: (1) human growth and development; (2) social and cultural foundations; (3) the helping relationship; (4) groups; (5) lifestyle and career development; (6) appraisal of the individual; (7) research and evaluation; and (8) professional orientation. Finally, a number of special topics are discussed that can have current and future benefits from the infusion of computer competence into the counselor education process.

        "description":"The most important theoretical perspectives on adolescent drug use are probably those of Akers which use ideas from differential association theory and a variant of social learning theory; Oetting and Beauvais' peer group perspective; and the family perspective of Patterson and Dishion. This research involved an examination of stages of initiation into drug use, the properties of drug use measures, and the specificity versus generality of drug use and other forms of deviant behavior. It also involved empirical research to determine the extent to which drug involvement can be regarded as a construct distinct from other manifestations of delinquent behavior. This research used a subset of data previously collected on a cohort-sequential sample of secondary school students,  collected from 1981-1983 as part of the School Action Effectiveness Study. These surveys measured an extensive array of parental, peer, and personal characteristics, including drug use and delinquency. Results imply that drug availability is an important determinant of individual drug involvement. Other implications include: (1) additional attention to basic psychometric theory and statistical methodology would be helpful in future research on the stepping stone perspective; (2) future research on school and environment as influences on adolescent drug use may have promise; and (3) variation from school to school in levels of drug use can be explained by the differences in the populations of students attending schools. Results also support the general deviance perspective and the drug  specificity perspective. (ABL)",

This study examined the relationship between crying frequency and reported physical disorders, and changes in crying frequency with age. Subjects were 225 men and 285 women ranging in age from 18-81. Subjects participated in telephone interviews and responded to questions about physical disorders, crying frequency, use of humor to cope with stressful events, and use of crying to cope with upsetting events. Results indicated that weeping was associated with increased disorder in early adulthood. As age increased, however, frequent criers were healthier than those who reported no weeping. Crying frequency decreased from ages 18-81 (with the exception of a slight increase  at middle age). Females reported greater crying frequencies than males at each level. These results integrate previous discrepant findings about weeping frequency, age, and physical disorder. That is, previous research with young adults has shown that high weepers reported greater psychological mood disturbance than low weepers. Weeping is shown to be associated with decreased physical disorder. The behavioral and attitudinal issues surrounding weeping require further study. (Author/ABL)",

Questionnaires were distributed to approximately 900 Japanese men and women, and t-tests were used to test for differences between the men's and women's groups. Results showed that, despite traditional Japanese ideals discouraging women's employment, both groups tended to be uncertain regarding whether women's employment would have negative effects on marriage or children. Nevertheless, both groups tended to believe that wives/mothers should not be employed when the wife prefers not to work, and when her husband wants her home. Japanese women tended to believe significantly more than Japanese men that  women are capable of handling the responsibilities of both the home and career. Japanese men tended to believe significantly more than Japanese women that women should stay home to have and raise children rather than work outside the home, that wives' employment would lead to marital adjustment difficulties, that maternal employment would harm children's development, and that wives/mothers should not be employed when they have preschool-aged, school-aged, or teen-aged children in the family.

These programs have typically been initiated based more on assumptions regarding community knowledge of depression than on factual data. This study assessed knowledge of depression in a random sample of 527 community living adults between the ages of 18 and 93. Subjects were presented with vignettes which described a young or old protagonist with depressive symptoms. Respondents were asked to identify potential problems and possible solutions. A depression information measure followed. The results indicated that community residents were aware of many objective features of  depression although they identified less information about treatment issues. Older respondents were the least informed of all subjects. Although there were no gender differences in objective knowledge among respondents, men were less likely to mention depression with regard to the vignettes. While many respondents appropriately acknowledged some of the characteristic symptoms, causes, and treatments for depression, a great deal of education still needs to occur. The findings from this study have implications for future work in the area of mental health and depression. (NB)",

        "description":"Retirement is recognized as a family experience, affecting retirees, their spouses, and their children. This study examined how the retirement transition affects the middle class, healthy, and financially secure male retiree and his wife. In-depth interviews were conducted with 92 couples from the Boston area in which the husband had been retired for 6 to 12 months. Responses from husbands and wives were classified as: (1) impingement; (2) the second look; (3) the spoiled retirement; and (4) retirement as resource. The response labeled \"impingement\" was almost entirely limited to the wives and refers to the overlap of husbands into the wife's sphere of activity. While most wives saw impingements as minor nuisances rather than as crises, both working and non-working women  mentioned disruption of daily routines. Wives generally reported that they had adjusted unilaterally to the new situation. For husbands retirement afforded a \"second look\" at their wives' daily lives. Many were dismayed at their wives' humdrum routines and at the amount of time spent on housework. When illness made normal activities impossible or was life-threatening, the result was often a \"spoiled retirement.\" Physical and emotional problems of other family members also sometimes resulted in spoiled retirement reponses. \"Retirement as resource\" refers to a global evaluation of retirement as a positive state, and was the modal response of the majority of respondents. Husbands' assessment of retirement focused on the personal level, while wives focused on the interpersonal realm. The  findings suggest that most problems of adjustment were either minor and short-lived or attributable to conditions other than retirement itself. (NB)",

The 1985 data were obtained from the Current Population Survey. Results included: (1) the changing propensity of older residents to move and to make interstate and interregional moves in which, as the overall mobility rates of older people in the Northeast, Midwest, and West were declining, their rates of interstate and interregional migration were increasing; (2) in the period of 1980-1985 mobility rates continued to decline, and smaller percentages of residents  living in the Northeast and Midwest were making interstate and interregional moves; (3) percentages of Northwest, Midwest, and West older residents who migrated to the South steadily increased over the first three decades; (4) interregional migrants from the Northeast and Midwest have found the South increasingly attractive; (5) the relative importance of the Northeast as a source of migrants declined while the relative importance of the West as a source of interregional migrants continued to increase; (6) after three decades of increasingly larger migration losses of older people, the Northeast and Midwest experienced smaller net migration losses in the 1980-85 period, and the South experienced smaller net migration gains in the 1980-85 period; and (7) in the 1980-85 period the West  emerged as a notable source region for the South's net migration.

A meta-theory exists where its value and usefulness is found in the theory's ability for describing phenomena common to all group theories. Nevertheless, GST certainly acknowledges: (1) the individual as a multi-system person; (2) the therapist as the most important person in the group; (3) the emotional-cognitive process as a system; (4) the importance of the boundary concept; (5) that the importance of the boundary functions, systeming and summing, and that emotional exchanges are not long  lasting; (5) there are various levels for intervention within a group, including intrapsychic, interpersonal, and group, and intervention can occur at any level; and (6) the unique advantages of the therapist &quot;thinking systems&quot; with the focus on process instead of content thinking.

        "description":"A stereotype is a standardized mental picture based on a common characteristic of a group of people, representing an oversimplified opinion or an uncritical judgment that is not reality-based. In order to understand the psychological basis of sex-role stereotyping it must be understood that the stereotype of men as strong, independent, and in control is based on psychological norms of mental health. Sex-role stereotypes begin at birth when babies are treated in stereotypic ways by families. Teachers continue stereotypic attitudes, regarding girls as better behaved and boys as having better bodies and brains. Sex-role stereotypes are often continued by peers, especially in puberty when sex-role expectations become even clearer. In language and communication, sex-role stereotypes  are promoted through such thing as the Miss and Mrs. terms, which denote a woman's relationship to a man. Schools can perpetuate sex-role stereotypes through the teachers' unconscious attitudes, feminine atmospheres in elementary schools, sexist language in texbtooks, and by not challenging women high school students to take adequate mathematics and science courses. Bias against women in the workplace still exists. Stereotypic views of men and women are constraining and harmful to both genders. To correct this, each person can treat others as individual human beings, and not only as members of a group. Respect for the individual will enrich everyone's life, and only when it is achieved can people begin to challenge and change sexism in society. (ABL)",

Paulo Freire and Donaldo Macedo's book &quot;Literacy: Reading the Word and the World&quot; can be used to refute E. D. Hirsch's arguments as presented in his &quot;Cultural Literacy: What Every American Needs to Know,&quot; but this kind of response results in the expenditure of valuable institutional time and space on comparatively inessential questions. The crisis is not that students are somehow suddenly inferior or that the curriculum is somehow suddenly debauched, but that the dominant definition of literacy and the pedagogy that accompanies that definition imagine reading to be only an act of consumption, of taking in information. The literacy crisis is that the current definition of literacy  and the pedagogy that drives this definition do not consider reading and writing as acts of production as well as consumption, as acts of making meaning as well as taking in meaning. What the pedagogy that promotes a definition of literacy as the production and consumption of text would look like in the classroom is illustrated by a student paper and a class discussion of an assigned essay.

Subjects, 150 undergraduates between the ages of 18 and 23, were measured for cognitive developmental level, self-efficacy, causal attribution for reading and writing success and failure, outcome expectancy, locus of control, and reading and writing performance. Results indicated differences between developmental classification (concrete, transitional, formal) in the relationships between beliefs and reading or writing performance, and indicated changes in the regression models and the  pattern of correlations between beliefs and reading or writing at the developmental level. Results further indicated differences between developmental classification in performance in reading and writing, and the relationship between reading and writing. Findings suggest that the specific cognitive skills represented by formal operational thinking influence both the magnitude of performance and beliefs and the structure of reading, writing, and belief relationships.

ALOZ has worked through a partnership model, inviting economic and social enterprises in the country to sponsor literacy programs for their workers and communities. The design of the study included the selection of 12 different social settings ranging from big city industrial areas, mines and railways, and a large-scale dairy farm, to  small city locations, rural settlements, and communal areas. In each setting, a cluster of respondents (for a total of 227) were chosen: learners, teachers, supervisors, administrators, agents of sponsoring and collaborating institutions, etc. Both Shona and Sindebele language areas were covered. People working at the headquarters of ALOZ were also interviewed. Results indicated that, in Zimbabwe, literacy has come to be a part of the definition of adulthood. Without exception, learners claimed that literacy had improved their lives, irrespective of the level of literacy attained. The most important consequences of literacy appeared inside the home in regard to the change in family relationships, with women and children benefitting from this change. Other areas influenced by literacy  included economics, health, and politics. Policy makers should be aware that literacy is at the core of human development. (MM)",

Subjects, 27 male and 45 female students from 6 classes in 3 public schools in central Oklahoma who read at an average of more than one year above grade placement, had their oral and silent reading rates measured for a variety of difficulty levels. Comparisons of the mean rates established by this study with mean rates established in previous studies indicate serious inconsistencies. The oral and silent reading rates obtained in this study indicate a decrease in the rate of reading in the past 20 years. Findings suggest that rate should not be considered as a factor in word recognition and comprehension tests but should be  measured as a separate component of the reading process. Instructional time should be directed to the improvement of rate and the development of flexibility in rate. (Two tables of data are included.) (RS)",

        "description":"The concept of inertia--the property by which a body in motion tends to remain in motion, and a body at rest tends to remain at rest--is analogous to a situation that occurs in reading. Some students, despite being able to read, choose not to read when other options are available. In terms of inertia, these students are at rest and tend to remain at rest, lacking the motivation to read. Several strategies and activities have the power to create an initial impetus toward independent and motivated reading. Reading aloud to children fosters growth in a number of reading areas, from developing a sense of story to improving vocabulary, as well as motivating students to finish a story started in a read-aloud session. Experiences in the school, such as field trips, guest speakers, and  films, often motivate students to read books on related topics. Books themselves can be an experience that leads students into other books. Series books or books by a noted author can encourage a student to read. Daily sustained reading at school and at home can motivate students to incorporate reading into their own schedule. Cooperative activities, placing students in reading situations in which they have some responsibility for the success or failure of a group endeavor, also motivates students to read. If teachers can set students' reading in motion using these strategies, the motion can often be enough to sustain itself into independent reading and learning. (MM)",

The case method approach is based upon one developed at the Harvard Business School. The case presents a situation or a problem that is real in terms of nature, players, and setting and for which there are a number of alternative courses of action. Students are forced to use the knowledge gained from teacher and textbooks to make decisions, to predict outcomes,  and to think critically and creatively. Reading education lends itself very well to a case method approach because there is currently no consensus in the field as to the best approach to the teaching of reading. Although there are criticisms of this approach, the reactions from students have been singularly positive. (RS)",

Several models of reading fluency instruction make fluency an integral part of the regular reading curriculum. For example, the Oral Recitation Lesson incorporates aspects of repeated readings, teacher modeling of fluent oral reading, and standards for student mastery of the text. Other recently developed curriculum models for fluency capitalize on the notion of pairing students into cooperative dyads and having them work together in supporting each other's growth in fluency and  general reading proficiency.

On the other hand, parents are viewed by many teachers and school officials as a source of frustration and difficulty in ameliorating children's reading difficulties and fostering growth in literacy. Parents' active commitment and participation is lacking in most attempts by schools to involve parents in their reading education program. Programs to help parents help their children in reading will not reach their full potential until parents are empowered. At the school level, parent advisory committees can be established to study the school reading program and create an agenda for parent reading programs. Parents can observe reading instruction as it takes place in the school. At the  individual classroom and parent-teacher level much can be done to empower parents. Teachers can ask parents what they would be willing to do at home to improve their child's reading. Parent volunteers in the classroom offer opportunities for empowerment. Teachers and administrators may initially find it difficult to share power and responsibility with parents. Strategies for overcoming this reluctance include holding seminars on the issue, and sharing experiences with teachers and parents who have successfully participated in such a program. Parent empowerment must be an honest and rigorous attempt to make parents equal partners with schools in the literacy development of their children. (MM)",

        "description":"Reading is best understood as a dialectic process where the influence of reader and text are constantly merging to create a jointly produced and evolving understanding. What occurs as the reader and text come together during reading is similar in form to a dialogue, a model for the reader-text relationship that has not been explored in the reader response literature. Establishing an empirical basis for the study of the reader-text relationship requires an ability to isolate the nature of the relationship as it exists at any one moment and then develops over time. The interruption method offers this ability by presenting the ideas, feelings, and associations of the reader for immediate analysis. This method consists of dividing the text into 12 sections and then recording the  reader's responses to each section on audiotape. The result is an assortment of actual data that allows for an analysis of the reader-text relationship over multiple parts of the reading. This kind of analysis will show that the reader-text relationship is a mutually dependent one composed of the interactive influence of both reader and text and the creation at each moment of a singular synthesis of meaning.

        "description":"This review examines 12 programs designed for use in classrooms to develop &quot;general thinking skills&quot; used in learning and problem-solving situations inside and outside classrooms. Analysis of program features focuses on the extent to which each program shows promise in helping students transfer the skills they develop through completing program exercises to other learning situations. It is argued that programs with multiple goals are more likely to promote transfer of skills than those that promote the single goal of particular skill development. Thus, programs that also focus on three additional goals (developing metacognitive awareness and strategies; conditional knowledge of contexts for knowledge and skill use; and attitudes and dispositions conducive to using the skills)  show more promise. Other program features that increase the likelihood of transfer are (1) program materials are content related; (2) teaching methods include a high degree of teacher mediation; (3) transfer of skills is directly taught; and (4) teachers are trained to use the materials. It is concluded that interventions to teach thinking skills can be useful tools, but they need to be used in conjunction with occasions for students to develop and use higher order thinking in subject area learning.

        "description":"A pilot study was conducted to contrast children's comprehension of inside view (where writers share the inner thoughts of characters with readers) and character plans in an original story and its basal reader adaptation prior to and following participation in a reading conference focused upon these aspects of character. Subjects were 12 students in Grade 3. The pilot study developed an instructional context for the reading of fiction which integrates the communicative and cognitive aspects of reading with a focus on literary content. It also created a methodology for evaluating the students' comprehension of inside view and character plans. The study questioned: how editorial changes which redesign the fabric of a story influence the reader's comprehension; and how the  instructional environment within which a story is discussed influences the reader's comprehension. Results of the pilot data suggest that the instructional context's emphasis on group storytelling, reciprocal teaching, and literary content encouraged the students to engage in comprehensive discussions on the texts' literary qualities as they monitored their comprehension of inside view and character plans. Despite the similarity of instruction across text groups, however, important differences in interpretation persisted. For this reason, the data suggest that it is the quality of the text which is of the utmost importance in helping students become intelligent readers.

        "description":"To illustrate the interdependent relationship between critical thinking and reading comprehension, and to show that critical thinking can be infused into classroom instruction using ordinary classroom materials (e.g. selections from a basal reading series), a study analyzed the transcript of a critical-thinking reading lesson for sixth grade students. The lesson was designed for &quot;A Stranger at the Door,&quot; a basal reader selection and short excerpt from the book &quot;The Death of Evening Star,&quot; by Leonard Everett Fisher. Students read the story independently and completed a written assignment before meeting to discuss the story. The assignment entailed gathering evidence to support two different hypotheses about the story that would be considered in the discussion. Analysis of the  discussion revealed that students used critical thinking when given the opportunity. Students gave reasons that could serve as evidence for two explanatory hypotheses, supported their judgments when they evaluated the strength of those reasons, and made inferences which integrated background knowledge with textual information. However, sometimes students' critical thinking was faulty because they misread the text or made unfounded assumptions. (Twenty-three references are attached.) (MM)",

        "description":"The best thinking and writing is at once personal and public, both infused with private meaning and focused upon the world beyond the self. The goal of writing teachers is to help students learn to negotiate between the two, to locate those dynamic points of connection where experience gives rise to inquiry. Notwithstanding the often eloquent dissent of those favoring the personal narrative, most composition instructors locate the center of their task in promoting facility with academic writing in all of its various guises, a goal which leads of necessity toward the expository. Such a focus diverts attention away from the narrative form, denying a clear vision of how it continues to mature and how it might also help nurture both the beginnings and development of expository  competence. Western culture's bias toward such &quot;decontextualized&quot; prose is powerfully reflected in a provocative essay by David Olson in which he delineates the relation of meaning to language as either &quot;extrinsic,&quot; as in an oral &quot;utterance,&quot; or &quot;intrinsic,&quot; as in a written &quot;text.&quot; As the world of ideas is mixed with the students' own lives and the stories they tell, the objective is brought into the world of personal meaning. Egocentricity is overcome, but not at the cost of subjective involvement. What is needed is not only a deeper appreciation of the poles of the continuum, but an understanding of the dialectic they can form together--how it informs the whole of cognition, and how it can inform the teaching of writing.

According to this metaphor, an individual learns a discourse through entering into the community that uses it, and by accepting the practices and values of those already in it. Yet an argument can be raised for a definition of discourse that is not tied to this view of community. Discourse can be seen as an inherited set of rules and constraints for using language. Teaching needs to be grounded in this view of discourse that centers on difference and change. The writing classroom is a space in which the differences between the discourse of the teacher, the university, and the students become strikingly clear. By viewing the classroom as a site where different discourses are contested  rather than as an entry point into an imagined &quot;community of academic discourse,&quot; teachers can center their work on an ongoing criticism of discourses both within and outside of the university. By dramatizing these conflicts, the writing class can create a set of chances for criticism to occur. The challenge lies in finding ways to make students' discourses into something they can question and work on. For example, in a class on writing about film, this means trying to get students not simply to read films more closely but also to question the ways they already have of looking at movies.

Results indicated that the degree of informality was negatively related to the degree of elaboration or exploration of knowledge, and the raters' positive/negative ratings were most highly related to degree of elaboration and knowledge exploration. Students conceived of journal writing as significantly more informal, private, unstructured and conversational than their conceptions of a &quot;good paper,&quot; indicating that students' perceptions of form influenced their writing.

Verbal speech can also be connected to print by reading aloud songs and poems, by communicating through &quot;written&quot; conversations, and by writing books from the children's verbal recounting of events in  their lives. Finally, teachers can help children understand the connection between literature and print by providing a large variety of books and ample time to look at them, by helping children understand and appreciate literature through book extensions, reading strategy instruction, and literature study, by integrating literature across the curriculum, and by reading aloud to the class.

        "description":"The American tradition of sovereign immunity and the Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution have provided certain legal protection to government personnel, including leaders of public elementary, secondary, and post-secondary institutions, but the concept of governmental immunity may be difficult to understand as it applies to educators. Generally, governmental immunity has protected educators in four areas: discretionary or judicial function, mandatory function, passive misconduct, and when state interests outweighed individual rights. On the other hand, courts also have held public educators liable in cases that involved: private function (proprietary), ministerial function (mandatory acts), optional or permissible function, creation or maintenance of nuisance  resulting in injury or death, active, positive or willful and intentional wrong, judicial waiver, legislative waiver, judicial appearance, state participation in federally regulated areas, Fourteenth Amendment violation, and Civil Rights Act of 1981 violation. There are basically two reasons supporting a rationale for governmental immunity as applied to public education: the theory of sovereignty and the concern for public policy. As instruments of the state and local governments public education and its officials have received sovereign and Eleventh Amendment immunity. However, when educators have looked to the doctrine of immunity as protection, they have found what could be expected from a rusty feudal shield in a modern war. An individual feels more secure while standing behind it,  but when the blast is over, the shield has offered no real protection. (Thirty-nine references are attached.) (RAE)",

Not only must the rhetorical acts of crusader terrorists be viewed as rhetoric, but they must also be considered a rhetorical genre. This genre, with the appropriate recurring forms, arises from the constraints imposed by the nature and purposes of terrorists and can be called the &quot;terrorist-spectacular.&quot; Although access to the media is the purpose of the terrorists, the long-term goal of the terrorist groups is to change the world according to some grand design. Another goal of terrorism is to demonstrate to terrorists their own worthiness and thus to claim a sort of moral victory over their  enemies. Given the important rhetorical purposes served by terrorist spectaculars, the prevention of terrorism cannot be realized through voluntary restraint or self-regulation by the news media. The most common approaches to terrorism prevention are erroneous because they are based upon false assumptions about the motivations which give rise to terrorism and about the rhetorical purposes served by violent actions. Terrorists and scholars can both benefit from the realization that terrorism cannot change the world. The carnage produced by the rhetors of terror serves no purpose. (Fifty-one notes are included.)

In an effort to refute this view the paper applies Kenneth Burke's dramatistic theory of communication to show that the motives and behavior of political terrorists can be explained without reference to the media coverage terrorism produces. The paper argues that terrorism would occur because of its symbolic and communicative values even if no media coverage were provided. Four assumptions are presented that have been refuted by existing research: (1) terrorists want a propaganda platform; (2) terrorists win sympathy for their causes; (3) coverage focuses on terrorists and their deeds; and (4) terrorism is contagious and the media spread it. The paper also contends that terrorism &quot;causes&quot;  media coverage, and not the reverse. The approach advocated in the paper is effective in helping to formulate a theory of terrorism, because it helps in understanding terrorism, in predicting the forms in which it will appear, and in learning how to control it. The paper concludes that even though terrorism cannot be controlled, knowledge of the purposes it serves provides hope that it may be possible to avoid the radical estrangements that necessitate this violence, or at least find other forms for radicals' expressions of order.

However, analysis using Kenneth Burke's dramatistic method can explain political terrorism without reference to desire for coverage. Terrorism would occur because of its symbolic value even with no media coverage. However, when terrorism passes into insurgency--that is, when terrorists find themselves capable of holding enemy territory and hence having traditional tactical and strategic objectives, the Burkean analysis may be less useful because communications to parties outside the inner circle of terrorists may serve instrumental objectives, while Burke's analysis best explains the consummatory functions of symbolic activity. Burke's  analysis of society can also be applied to terrorist societies to explain their violence. The dramatistic approach can make it possible to predict the forms in which terrorism will appear, and to pursue efforts to control it. And if the calls for censorship and other verbal victimizations and mortifications of the media can be explained, it may be possible to avoid falling prey to them when confronted with the plausible but unsubstantiated arguments that media coverage aids and abets terrorists.

Taking the best from quantitative and qualitative research methods, Q-Technique provides a new and creative approach to interdisciplinary teaching. The method seems particularly suited to humanities education by providing a means for students to formulate a Q-Sort based on content from many different fields. By using Q-Methodology, students can even test theories in the field they are studying to see if their thinking processes support the theories. Two major ways that the Q-Technique can be used in teaching  the humanities involve students or the teacher compiling a list of statements for a Q-Sort using literature as the source of statements and compiling a list of statements for a Q-Sort using interviews. Anyone using a Q-Sort should consider the various discussions about the advantages and statistical soundness of using a structured Q.

When children do not have ownership, they go through the motions, stand where they are told, say what they are told, and usually dread the experience. When children have ownership, their acting becomes secondary to the main reason for the whole exercise, which is to help them build relationships and to cope more effectively with all the situations life is presenting them. In a school, two musicals (&quot;Mary Poppins&quot; and &quot;Oz&quot;) were presented using the notion of ownership. Children were closely involved in every stage of the production; the  teachers served as dispensable coaches and facilitators. The children became so deeply involved in the production that many wondered what the teachers would be doing during the performance. Teachers and students shared the responsibility for the productions, for even when the children do own the story, they still need some help in the telling. When children own a production and teachers have genuine roles to play, the process and the production will be fulfilling personally and professionally for both teachers and children. (RS)",

        "description":"To examine how the contents of Korean television serial dramas have changed and to determine trends of their portrayals of male and female characters' lifestyles, a study analyzed Korean television dramas of 1977 and 1987. A sample of three channels' video--22 daily and 14 weekly episodes of 18 different television dramas during weekday prime time (7 p.m. to 10 p.m.) In September 1977 and September 1987--was used for the study. Analysis revealed that the setting for most dramas of both years was Korea. Dramas dealing with psychological problems in 1977 usually depicted people who were dedicated to some clear purpose in life with positive attitudes. However, in 1987 most dramas portrayed characters who were skeptical about their current and future lives. Regarding the fictional  characters on these dramas, the following differences were noted: (1) the number of characters per drama increased; (2) the number of supporting roles decreased, while the number of major roles increased; and (3) male characters were increasingly important in 1987 dramas. In 1987, both male and female characters were more often classified as active and independent than in 1977, and female characters were even more active and independent than male characters. In 1987, the dramas examined current problems, such as the loss of community ties and the break-up of the family, while in 1977 dramas reflected a nostalgia for the warm community ties that had been lost in the process of economic growth.

These aesthetic perspectives are elaborated in relation to specific historic, institutional, and political trends in American society. The paper traces public television usage and support as the product of confusing and sometimes contradictory cultural forces--forces whose origins predate both television and film. The paper argues that these broad forces continue to exert influence on the way many Americans, particularly public television enthusiasts, interact with this extraordinarily realistic medium. The paper also invites speculation on and reexamination of a number of widely held beliefs about television as a medium, and public television in particular: (1) the notion  that television is a monolithic medium; (2) misleading conceptualizations of television as a revolutionary medium; (3) the idea that television is a lower-status popular art form largely because the most prevalent American television practices have developed in opposition to both the precepts of formal education and the value hierarchy of consciousness in Western society; and (4) the views that television is an unusually coercive and explicit medium with a singular, and somewhat unavoidable message. The paper argues that changes in form, aesthetics, and content are evolutionary rather than revolutionary, and a long term perspective is in order.

        "description":"Defining defensiveness as a protective reaction resulting from fear or a threat to one's face or ego, this paper provides a perspective on both verbal and nonverbal aspects of defensiveness. First, the paper examines two trait-like communication predispositions--communication apprehension and touch avoidance--which arguably produce defensive behavior. Communication apprehensives are described as displaying three predominant interrelated behavior patterns characterized by withdrawal, reduced awareness, and tension, posited to be self-protective responses that paradoxically cause a negative spiral of fear, anxiety, and defensiveness. Similarly, while communication apprehension affects the likelihood of verbal contact, touch avoidance may affect the likelihood of nonverbal contact  and increased intimacy. Next, the literature on disconfirmation (defined as behavior that causes another person to value himself less, with disconfirming communication characterized as indirect, closed, and ambiguous) is examined for its contribution to the defensiveness construct. Three different yet overlapping styles of disconfirming communication are discussed in the paper: (1) indifference; (2) imperviousness; and (3) disqualification. Finally, research on nonverbal immediacy (viewed as the inverse of defensiveness) is reviewed to derive some additional nonverbal behaviors associated with defensiveness.

The subjects, 54 returned sojourners (i.e., students who had studied abroad), filled out a questionnaire to measure reentry shock and relational satisfaction. Subjects were also given questionnaires measuring their locus of control for affiliation beliefs and their interpersonal uses for communication. Correlations among the data indicated that: (1) reentry shock was not associated with internal or external locus of control; (2) locus of control beliefs for affiliation was moderately associated with uses for communication; and (3) internal and external locus of  control were associated with various uses of communication. A negative correlation was found between reentry shock and relational satisfaction. Results indicated that reentry was not associated with either internal or external locus of control in this study and that reentry shock can lead to improved interpersonal skills, improved relationships with family members, and even increased intrapersonal knowledge.

The subjects, 853 students from three western universities, participated in a survey soliciting information on the uses of uncertainty reduction strategies with a same-sexed, equal-status acquaintance. Results revealed significant gender differences in the uses of uncertainty reduction strategies. While both males and females used another person's self-disclosure to reduce uncertainty, the other person's disclosures were more important for reducing women's relational uncertainty. Also, men felt that their own  self-disclosures helped them reduce relational uncertainty, but women relied more on interrogation strategies and nonverbal immediacy to reduce uncertainty. Furthermore, gender differences were also noted in how these strategies were used to increase attributional confidence. While both men and women primarily used their own self-disclosure to elicit other's self-disclosure, women also incorporated use of interrogative strategies and greater use of nonverbal immediacy (smiling, eye contact, touching). Men tended to rely more on interrogation strategies. (Four tables of data and 38 references are attached.) (MM)",

        "description":"More than a decade ago the manner in which the North Dakota educational community related to the state legislature changed suddenly and dramatically. The North Dakota School Boards Association (NDSBA) employed a new executive director. Administrators in the state created a new entity, the North Dakota Council of School Administrators (NDCSA), and secured a new executive secretary. The North Dakota Education Association (NDEA) expanded its staff and diversified its services. The agendas of these groups suggested collaborative approaches to problem solving, and the mix of personalities permitted that collaboration to occur. In theoretical terms, North Dakota progressed from a &quot;locally based disparate&quot; to &quot;statewide monolithic&quot; linkage in a very brief period. The actors in the&quot;North Dakota monolith&quot; were those predicted in Iannaccone's (1967) theory. The scope and nature of collaboration among individuals and organizations and the resulting achievements are detailed. Each of the leaders of the three dominant state education associations was interviewed with a 17-question structured interview instrument in the spring of 1986. The interviews with these leaders, actual observations of their behavior in various settings and the products of that behavior, along with socioeconomic and demographic characteristics in the state, are related to current organizational theory.

        "description":"Although female teachers have dominated education, relatively few women have pursued administrative positions. In 1988, women in Ohio held only 4.5 percent of all superintendencies. The state generally lags behind the lackluster national average, according to a 1985 Project on Equal Education report. Because of changing U.S. demographics, future working women will take their careers more seriously than their predecessors. This paper discusses characteristics of future educational leaders, examines women's underrepresentation in leadership roles, explores women's leadership styles, and suggests ways for women to enter educational administration. Besides basic management skills, new leaders will need to possess vision, visibility, concern for people, power-building strategies, and  a cooperative, yet firm leadership style. Numerous theories exist to explain the dearth of female leaders, ranging from fear of success to denial of equal opportunity. New brain research suggests that neurological differences may account for gender variations in organizing reality and achieving identity. Women should not assume a &quot;male&quot; leadership style, but develop their own style within the framework of their femininity. Many &quot;female&quot; traits previously considered liabilities (such as cooperation, intuition, and open communication) may prove to be valuable assets for 21st century female administrators. Recent research has demonstrated the benefits of feminine culture in schools. Women administrators offer various suggestions for aspirants: (1) know yourself; (2) share goals; (3) find a  mentor; (4) network; (5) be prepared; (6) be above reproach; and (7) do not make gender an issue.

Chapter 2 outlines major criticisms of the effective schools movement, such as its (1) simplistic formula; (2) overblown research claims; (3) promises of quick results; (4) limited research population; (5) focus on narrow educational outcomes; (6) promotion of authoritarian techniques; and (7) overemphasis on test  scores. As the next chapter shows, the &quot;principal principle&quot; has been endorsed widely without considering underlying research limitations. Overreliance on the strong principal as a solution to school problems ignores more recent research findings and reflects the current top-down school organization inhibiting change and improvement. Contradictory evidence about the leadership factor demands a reexamination of the term &quot;effectiveness.&quot; Recent research favors a multidimensional definition of the principal's role. In the absence of comprehensive assessment tools and longitudinal studies, policymakers should be cautious about accepting instructional leadership as a consistent correlate of effective schools.

Data were collected with an adaptation of Bougon's (1983) Self-Q interviewing technique, in which respondents first ask themselves questions, then verify key concepts drawn from the questions, and finally indicate the causal relationships among the most important concepts and the nature of those relationships. Creating the individual cause maps involved moving from a broad, holistic assessment of the cause map to the delineation of subparts. At each stage, causal findings were interpreted against the substantive  content of the concepts evoked by the individual respondent. Examples are drawn from four individual case studies of first-grade teachers, and findings are summarized with regard to the nature of the concepts used by the teachers, their perceived level of influence, the utility of examining the causal structure of individual maps, and the systematic structural differences across individuals on some critical dimensions not fully examined to date.

In 1986 and 1987, legislation was introduced in both houses of the U.S. Congress that would have provided direct federal aid to school-based health clinics. However, the legislation died in committee, and no new legislation was introduced in 1988.

Traditional analyses are discussed on the premise that schools function like private firms, where either the classroom or the school is the producing unit and the teacher or the principal is the decision-maker who controls and shapes the teacher-learning process. This premise is found to disregard the key variables of school district administrative organization and its impact on teacher effectiveness. The report finds that school district administrations function primarily by political, not economic or even educational, criteria. A model of school production is proposed that is administrative/politically based and that allows the  underlying technology of school production to vary. A methodology for assessing the costs and \"effectiveness\" of alternative school district administrative organization is developed.

Part 1, \"The Crucible,\" describes the three conflicting images of teaching and administering from the earliest days of both occupations to the  present: political, managerial, and instructional. Chapters 1, 3, and 5 explore how these images arose, how they flourished, and how they created a set of constant tensions that continue to inspire and plague both occupations. The intervening chapters, 2, 4, and 6, illustrate this discussion by drawing on the author's personal experiences in teaching and administering. Part 2, \"Meanings\" (chapters 7 and 8) distills the argument and explores the significance of seeing teachers and administrators as sharing common experiences and performing similar functions within different settings. Notes are included, along with an index. (TE)",

Acceptance, meaningful work, meaningful compensation, and job security without institutionalization comprise the philosophical issues that the school board and community, building level and central office administration, and teachers must deal with if job enlargement schemes are to be successfully implemented. Procedural issues that district policymakers must deal with include the ladder's height, eligibility to apply for career positions, and the selection process for career ladder positions. Framing these issues requires the acceptance of the following conditions by school district personnel: (1) different responsibilities and  levels of compensation in a system that is traditionally and strongly egalitarian; (2) a system that has competition among teachers who normally only compete for a position at the time of hire; (3) a system which has limited security that must be earned by performance and peer acceptance; and (4) a system that may have limited union recognition.

The principals' ability to recognize disabling practices and to invigorate school environments through proven leadership and management, are key issues. Three \"model\" letters addressed to a new principal present a basis for constructing a universal job description for the principalship; for developing the university curriculum for prospective principals; and for evaluating  principals in practice.

A 20-minute personal interview public opinion survey (N=2,550) was collected and data were analyzed via cross-tabulations of 133 opinion variables and 19 demographic and control variables that included sex, race, age, education, marital status, family income, residence, years in state, employment status, status of school children, household size, housing status, political affiliation, political orientation, and voter status. Findings reveal that the Southeast is proeducation because it rates primary and secondary education the number one funding priority among public services; proequity because it strongly believes that school districts should be equal in the financial resources  devoted to the average child; and profinance because it supports a commitment to public school education by wanting it financed adequately even if that requires a tax increase.

Orientation activities, goals, participant expectations and reactions, and benefits of the program were discussed on the basis of two personalized perspectives on the use of mentoring. First, the operation of the mentoring concept in Bexley City Schools is described, including details of the general format for the work that brought administrative mentors and candidates together. Second, the personal reflections of one Danforth candidate are  presented as a way to articulate some of the more meaningful aspects of the overall preparation program. Suggestions encompass specific ways mentors might help aspiring administrators. An overview of some of the most important benefits derived by candidates throughout the program conclude the study.

Findings are discussed with respect to the principals' understandings of empowerment, the difference between these schools and more traditional schools, advantages and disadvantages of teacher empowerment, redefining the principal's role in teacher-empowered schools, changes in the principal's role, and teachers' expectations of principals in schools where teachers share in governance and decisionmaking. The  conclusion discusses nine important themes that emerged from these interview data regarding teacher empowerment and the principalship: (1) the language of shared governance and empowerment; (2) readiness for professional growth and empowerment; (3) the importance of the superintendent's leadership in empowerment; (4) time as a key resource for empowerment; (5) boundary spanning for school principals; (6) enhancement of teachers' and principals' professional image; (7) the importance of hearing teachers' voices; (8) shared professional thinking; and (9) dealing with power through empowerment.

        "description":"This paper highlights the findings of Gougeon's 1989 study of high school principals of schools with grade configurations 9 through 12 in the state of Washington, a study based on the Principal Leadership as Social Control (PLASC) theory. Accordingly, the first section describes the PLASC theory as social control of teachers through power- and authority-based interactions that bring teacher expectations into alignment with the expectations of the school. The PLASC theory explains social control of teachers through a matrix of six leadership dimensions, three authority-based and three power-based. In the PLASC instrument used in the study, these leadership dimensions are measured by means of Likert scales through which principals assess the importance they attribute to each  dimension, in both theory and practice. Results are reported for each of the six dimensions: (1) Organizational Functional Structures Dimension (OFS); (2) Teacher Experiences Systems (Authority) Dimension (TESA); (3) Principal Task Activities Dimension (PTA); (4) Power Structure Systems Dimension (PSS); (5) Teacher Experiences Systems (Power) Dimension (TESP); and (6) Principal Reward/Punishment Actions Dimension (PRPA). Remaining sections discuss dynamics of the leadership process and the meaning of leadership as social control. The study proposes three communication alternatives--official, personal, and structural--that principals can employ to gain effective social control over teachers. References are included. (TE)",

Frequencies were tabulated for the number of public schools participating in education partnerships and the number of partnerships. In addition, percentages were tabulated for the number of schools and students  participating in education partnerships and the types of partnerships in schools. Percentages describing the 1987-88 demographic characteristics in schools participating in educational partnerships were collected according to geographic region, metropolitan status, instructional level, size of school enrollment, and percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches.

The purpose of the surveys was to establish a data base upon which to predicate internal decisions affecting the district, the community, and the individual brothers. The data from the first survey were used to draft preliminary proposals for change. The second survey provided specific information regarding the personal perceptions of the brothers. The survey instrument addressed several  categories: community life style and training, brothers' perceptions of staffing policies, retirement data, and brothers' expectations of district administrators. The research data from both surveys are included (in the text and in appendix A). The survey findings showed that conservative attitudes were dispersed among young and old. Additionally, the surveys identified worksites that were undesirable to all groups as well as worksites that were viewed with mixed perceptions.

Project TEEM did not specify a standard transition model; rather, it specified a planning process for schools to develop their own individual transition procedures utilizing a broad-based planning team. The TEEM model identified critical steps in successful transition, and identified objectives and accompanying activities  which must occur in order for a school system to successfully develop and implement a systematic transition process. The report includes results of a project evaluation and a list of training, dissemination, and other activities conducted during the 3 years of Project TEEM.

The timing of the Federal Funds Survey coincided with the third quarter of fiscal year (FY) 1984; therefore, the amounts reported for 1984 reflect congressional appropriation actions as of that period, as well as apportionment and reprogramming decisions as of that time. Data for 1985 represent administration budget proposals that had not been acted on. A list of federally funded R&amp;D centers (with total federal obligations for R&amp;D and R&amp;D plant in FY 1983) is included. (JN)",

The rationale was that these loans would encourage students majoring in mathematics or science to prepare for teaching careers. Funds made available through the loan program were distributed to the 15 colleges and universities in the state that have teacher education programs. This study surveyed these institutions to determine the interpretation of guidelines and distribution of funds by subject area, the adequacy of the funding level, and the number of mathematics and science teachers available as a result of the program. Among the results  (presented as answers to nine questions) are those indicating that the number of students in mathematics and science teacher preparation programs has increased, more males than females received loans, and only one-third of those who completed preparation under the program were teaching science or mathematics in Washington public schools (it was noted that some individuals were still seeking employment). Recommendations based on these and other results include continuing the program and clarifying program guidelines. (JN)",

One of the persistent problems that has deterred universalization of primary education is the early dropping out of children from schools. Case studies describing the magnitude and causes of dropout and actions being undertaken to prevent dropout are provided for the countries of China, India, Peninsular Malaysia, the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. There is much variation concerning the dropout problem both between and within Asian countries. In general it can be said, however, that countries with high dropout rates also have high repetition rates, inadequate school provision, low female enrollment,  and disparities of dropout between urban and rural children. Because high repetition and high dropout rates usually occur in the early school grades, careful attention must be paid to grade 1 and preschool education. Community and nonformal educational resources must be used and incentives must be provided, especially to females. (RM)",

        "description":"Educators attending the 1984 Wingspread Conference discussed major challenges to improving world studies courses and identified strategies for addressing those challenges. The only opportunity the vast majority of American high school students have to obtain formal instruction about the world comes in a survey course of world history offered in the tenth grade. The survey course lacks an adequate conceptual base, attempts to cover too much content, and is difficult to teach. Practical steps that must be taken to strengthen world studies courses include (1) preparation of a handbook of alternative conceptualizations for world history courses, (2) collection of world studies course syllabi to be made available to teachers, (3) preparation of resources to facilitate the local  development of global relations courses, (4) development of world studies teacher education courses and leadership programs for educators responsible for staff development in their school systems, and (5) involvement of teachers in evaluation and research relevant to school needs. In addition, the role of academic disciplines in public decision-making processes that set standards for social studies should be strengthened. (RM)",

        "description":"Three publications (&quot;Dissertation Abstracts International,&quot;&quot;Social Education,&quot; and &quot;Theory and Research in Social Education&quot;) are reviewed to determine trends in types of social studies research conducted between 1977 and 1984. Using a four-fold classification system, 159 studies are surveyed. Results show an overwhelming predominance of analytic research, with 48.5 percent of the research labeled as analytic science research, 15.8 percent as conceptual theory research, 15.7 percent as particular study research, and 22 percent as global reflection research. Fifty-two percent of the dissertations in &quot;Dissertation Abstracts International&quot; were classified as analytic studies, with a focus predominantly on textbook analysis. Research in &quot;Social Education&quot; was reported to be the most  analytic of the three sources, with over 57 percent of its research classified as analytic. Again, textbooks were a major focus, with only 6 out of 25 issues not including articles about textbooks. The most favorable percentages of global reflection and other qualitative forms of research appeared in &quot;Theory and Research in Social Education,&quot; with 33 percent of its research labeled as global reflection and only 40 percent as analytic science. The second half of the paper calls for a broader perspective for social studies research and identifies a series of themes that may be used to support a more critical research agenda. The themes suggested are: (1) freedom versus control, (2) tradition versus change, (3) ethics versus rationality, and (4) desire versus reality. (IS)",

The attitudes and behaviors of the membership were found to be in agreement with the resolution. The majority were active in reading relevant literature, signing petitions, and engaging in informal discussions with others. Psychologists with a humanistic/existential orientation were most likely to have attitudes supportive of nuclear freeze and disarmament. Psychologists with children and older psychologists were likely to support peace organizations. Not wanting to survive  a nuclear war was related to antinuclear activities. No differences in attitudes and behaviors were found for the following variables: professional identification, gender, and personal experience of war. (Author/IS).",

Descriptions and analyses are provided of art criticism formats presented in art education literature according to format characteristics, theoretical and research rationales, anticipatory information, types of objects to be studied, and instructional cues. These dimensions, in turn, are referenced to a continuum of educational and philosophical perspectives. Feldman's (1973) four-step format, (description, formal analysis, interpretation, and judgment), traditionally used by art critics, serves as a generalized frame of reference by which 15 other works are compared. Separate sections  describe each of the five dimensions, the four steps of Feldman's traditional format, and applications of perceptual and learning theory in art criticism literature. Following a bibliography listing over 40 related references, two figures are provided to aid teachers in selecting a format appropriate to particular contexts and goals. In figure 1, the art criticism formats and their tabulated characteristics are cross-referenced with critical, educational, and philosophical continuum tendencies. In figure 2, critical, educational, and philosophical perspectives of art are listed on parallel continua that extend from an emphasis on external controls to a reliance on internal directives.

After further education, she began to campaign for a female seminary to train teachers. In 1821, the first such school in the United States opened as the Troy Female Seminary. Her educational philosophy stressed the importance of adjusting the material covered to the age of the child and developing reasoning rather than rote memorization. Her textbooks on geography and history were widely used and reflected the prejudices of her day. She was a crucial figure in  extending education to women; however, she did not consider herself a feminist. (IS)",

Chapter 1 provides an introduction and background information. Chapter 2 details interview procedures and methodology. Chapter 3 examines the questions asked about participation at live performances of jazz, classical music, opera, musicals, plays, ballets, art galleries, and museums, as well as questions about reading habits. Chapter 4 examines the methodology and gives a more detailed analysis of the questions considered in Chapter 3. Chapters 5 through 9 deal with the non-core survey questions.

        "description":"Designed for use in secondary school social studies classes, this guide provides activities for helping students understand some of the fundamental principles of government as well as its structure, politics, and effects on the individual. Information, articles, and cartoons from the Austin-American Statesman form the basis of the readings, along with background information from several texts and articles by public leaders, officials, and reporters. Forty-five lessons focus on levels of government, government and the citizen, reporting and interpreting government, the Texas legislature, special interest groups and lobbying, the executive branch, and the Texas judiciary. Some of the teaching strategies recommended include: brainstorming, gaming, mock trial and legislature  sessions, simulations, pictorial analysis, distinguishing fact and opinion, cartoon interpretation, role playing, discussion, and writing activities. Emphasis is also placed on higher level skills such as application, analysis, and evaluation. For each lesson, objectives, materials needed, a step-by-step lesson plan, and reproducible student handouts are provided. Appendices include teacher and student evaluation forms and maps showing congressional districts within Texas. Although the guide focuses on government in Texas, it can be used as a model for developing similar guides in other states. (LH)",

Data in chapter one build a case for action on aging. Several key points of the IPAA are made in chapter two. In chapter three, responses by the United Nations and by individual nations since 1982 are detailed, while chapter four focuses specifically on past and future responses of the United States. Appendices include a fact sheet on the American Association for International Aging, the complete text of the IPAA, an annotated list of trust fund projects approved or earmarked for funding, a state department report on the World Assembly on Aging, and the concluding chapter of Charlotte Nusberg's &quot;Innovative Aging Programs Abroad: Implications for the U.S.&quot; (LH)",

The second section describes the factors that have shaped U.S. security policy, examining security in Asia, the Near East and Southwest Asia, the Western Hemisphere, Africa, and Europe. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the strategic defense initiative are also examined. The role of arms control in U.S. security and the Soviet approach to arms control are examined in the third section. The fourth section reports on eight critical arms control challenges  and how the United States and its allies are addressing them. The challenges are: strategic arms reduction talks, intermediate-range nuclear forces, mutual and balanced force reductions, confidence-building measures, chemical weapons, space arms control, nuclear testing, and nuclear nonproliferation. The publication concludes by summarizing the prospects for arms control. An arms control glossary is provided. (RM)",

A responsible national security policy must include both strong deterrence and active pursuit of arms control.

Following an explanation of the global nature of environmental problems, a summary of the salient facts regarding the following six issues is provided: quality of the atmosphere, depletion of fresh water, loss of soil productivity, loss of genetic diversity, tropical deforestation, and toxic contamination and hazardous materials. In each of these cases, human behavior has disrupted the natural biogeochemical cycles of the biosphere, thereby generating chain reactions that multiply the problems confronting people and their governments. It is argued that regardless  of the policy positions of the government on international environmental issues, U.S. citizens are involved in all of the aforementioned global issues and many more. The essay urges the United States to return to a position of leadership in global environmental matters, based on the conclusion that the cost of regaining credibility and leadership in international environmental affairs could be much less than the ultimate failure to do so. A glossary of acronyms and a list of Stanley Foundation papers and activities are also included in the document. (LH)",

In drawing, students acquire a repertoire of approaches to record visual information, develop the ability to investigate visual relationships, communicate by developing technical competence and individual insight, and develop their skills at evaluation. In composition, students develop competence with the components of image, analyze the relationships among components of images, and express meaning through control of visual relationships. In encounters, students investigate the  sources of images, how art differs from culture to culture and through time, and the cultural impact of images. Specific objectives and concepts to be covered in each grade and for each of the three areas are given along with study approaches, resources, and evaluation approaches.

The project was based on the assumption that teacher education programs could incorporate research as an inquiry-based process for student teachers, cooperating teachers, and teacher education faculty. Three teacher education program sites in Nevada, Utah, and California used the inquiry-based process in their programs. A cross-site analysis identified variables associated with the different sites and the interactions among the variables. Little variation was reported among the three sites. However, there were some differences in the goals, initial planning, and the methods of intervention. A supportive  relationship between each teacher education program and its cooperating school district was important. While there were no clear results regarding change in classroom teaching behaviors, the perspectives of students and cooperating teachers toward the value of research became increasingly positive across all three sites. Achievement of the project goal of continuing and expanding networks among teacher education programs and local education agencies appeared promising. (Author/JD)",

A discussion is also offered on the recommendation that the GPA requirement for admission to administrator preparation programs be raised from the present 2.5 on undergraduate work to 3.0. Twelve negative comments are presented on recommendations to raise the GPA requirements for admission to both teacher education and administrator preparation programs, and it is concluded that no changes  should be made until six specific conditions are met.

The Helsinki Test is a simplification of the Rorschach-type technique, designed so it is possible for the constructor, using relatively simple mathematical procedures, to replace to a relatively great extent, the subjective evaluations that the Rorschach user is commonly confronted with. Instructions for using the test are presented in four sections: (1) experimental apparatus and environment; (2) scoring and different response variables; (3) evaluation of  intelligence; and (4) description of character qualities.

One interpretation of these findings emphasizes the shared values of all school participants which constitute the ethos of the school. This paper presents a conceptual framework for studying the processes of cultural transformation, focusing on teachers whose beliefs, values, and behaviors affect student learning. The study concentrated on schools known to be improving in order to increase knowledge about how cultural changes lead to school improvement. A description is given of a perspective that emphasizes the cultural elements in effective schools and the interplay of culture and change. The concept of culture is defined and elaborated upon,  identifying key assumptions about the cognitive and symbolic aspects of culture. Processes of cultural change and transformation are described. The paper concludes by describing five cultural domains or themes: (1) collegiality of faculty; (2) relationships within the community; (3) purposes and expectations of school leadership; (4) how work is conducted in the school; and (5) the knowledge base used for teaching by the school's faculty and administrators.

A brief discussion is presented on the viability of user participation as an evaluation strategy, with special attention to its potential for increasing the use of evaluation information. A number of program changes are outlined that resulted from an increased use of evaluation information by the program staff. An analysis is presented of why the program staff, in this instance, were very receptive  to the information generated by the evaluation study, and why they used it so readily to revise the program.

It appeared that collaborative planning between teacher and pupils was the key strategy contributing to the learning community characteristics. A second contributing strategy was the explicit management and organization system employed by the teacher. Examples are given of classroom events that illustrate how the teacher established a learning community classroom, what happened during collaborative curriculum planning, and the pre-planning techniques of the teacher for daily activities. Implications for  teacher education are discussed. Appended are the teacher's notes on the two units of study completed during the school year. (Author/JD)",

The process was designed to promote teachers' ability to establish and maintain effective classroom groups. Teachers' uses of group-development principles, cooperative-learning strategies, and related student outcomes were investigated. Analysis of interviews and observational data suggested the possibility that the teachers' motivation for learning to manage instruction through cooperative groups was critical to the differences in observed performance. Teachers who used group-development strategies primarily as a means of classroom management were less successful than teachers who used group-development strategies to increase  student responsibility, accountability, and productivity. Results of the study indicated the importance of having a teacher support group during initial implementation of new approaches to instruction. Colleagial problem solving proved to be a key factor in the success of the project. It also appeared that staff development programs that allow both direct and indirect contact with a teacher educator can be successful in accomplishing implementation goals. (JD)",

        "description":"In considering the questions of what sense teachers make of their professional education and what they learn during teacher preparation, two case studies are presented, based on an analysis of interviews across the first year of teacher preparation. The first student was enrolled in an academic-learning program which emphasized the importance of theoretical and subject matter knowledge in learning to teach. Field experiences were limited, brief, and connected with specific course requirements. The other student participated in a decision-making program, emphasizing generic methods of teaching and research-based decision making with personal reflection. Regular time was spent in classrooms aiding, observing, and teaching small and large group lessons. The studies reveal how  differences in personal history and formal preparation can help or hinder the transition from commonsense to professional thinking. They also suggest that very little normatively correct learning can be trusted to come about in teacher preparation without instruction that takes into account the preconceptions of future teachers.

A first-order factor analysis clearly identified the 13 facets of self-concept that the SDQ III is designed to measure. A series of hierarchical models clearly supported the separation of the 13 SDQ III facets of self-concept into academic and nonacademic components, and the academic facets into math/academic and verbal/academic components. However, support for the physical, social, and moral second-order factors was less clear. Third-order hierarchical models resulted in  a clearly defined hierarchical general self-concept that was substantially related to general esteem, and to physical, social and emotional components of self-concept, but not to the academic and moral values components.

This eight year project (1976-1984) was evaluated annually both internally and externally. The processes were monitored, student progress charted, and participant perceptions measured annually and compared longitudinally. This final report contains 1983-84 information, an evaluation of the entire project, and a brief presentation of the follow-up survey of almost 400 former program  participants. Some took only a course or two as needed, some completed only certificate requirements, and 129 completed degree programs. The East Texas State University Bilingual training project was very successful in institutionalizing the project into its regular system. Students viewed the program as worthwhile, and were, generally, successful in gaining their degrees, certificates, and the abilities necessary to teach bilingually and in English as a second language.

        "description":"This paper describes a system of built-in, or internal, evaluation used within the Botswana National Literacy Program (NLP). Launched in 1981 and targeted toward illiterate adults and youth aged 10 years and older, the program aims at eradicating illiteracy in Botswana by 1986. The built-in evaluation was implemented in 1983, using program officials trained in a series of workshops as &quot;barefoot evaluators.&quot; The practical realities of a Third World country with minimal infrastructure and scarcity of skilled manpower made classical methodological control impossible. The evaluation was therefore conceptualized as an experience creating a new culture of action within the NLP rather than as a technical experiment. Instruments served as frames for meanings rather than as yardsticks for  measurement. Evaluation results have been gratifying: NLP program participation increased by 60 percent. Most collected data were usable and provided a coherent and credible program picture. Results could be utilized before formal report release. The experience of constructing this built-in evaluation system reinforces the view that such humanized methods are much more useful in Third World countries than external evaluations in the sophisticated research mode.

        "author":["Flanery, Randall C."],
        "description":"Increasing attention is being given to the psychometric adequacy of recently published structured child interviews. Three published child interviews, The Child Assessment Schedule (CAS), The Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents (DICA), and The Interview Schedule for Children (ISC) were evaluated in terms of the available evidence of their validity. Four types of validity were examined: content validity; criterion-related validities; concurrent and predictive validity; and construct validity. A major obstacle to validity investigations has been the absence of a widely agreed upon criterion which is truly more valid than the interview itself. This issue has been dealt with by studying known groups, by comparing the degree of association between interview scores and  other measures of psychopathology, and agreement between child and parent on interview. All three interviews were judged to show reasonable evidence of content validity, although there are more questions regarding the DICA. The most common validity investigation has been of concurrent validity. The few studies of the ISC and CAS have found adequate validity. Studies of the DICA are of poor quality and have produced disappointing results. The predictive or construct validities of these interviews are virtually uninvestigated. The preliminary studies are encouraging but are of insufficient quantity to definitively judge their validity. (Author)",

        "description":"While the aptitude treatment interaction (ATI) approach to educational measurement emphasizes establishing salient learner characteristics, systematic formative evaluation provides ongoing evaluation for instructional program modification. Systematic formative evaluation appears more tenable than ATI for developing individualized instructional programs. This meta-analysis investigates the effects of systematic formative evaluation of educational programs on student achievement. Twenty-one controlled studies generated 95 relevant effect sizes, with an average effect size of .72. The magnitude of effect size was associated with publication type, data evaluation methods, and use of behavior modification. Findings indicate that unlike reported ATI approaches to individualization,  systematic formative evaluation procedures reliably increase academic achievement. This suggests that, given an adequate measurement methodology, practitioners can inductively formulate successful individualized educational programs. (Author/BS)",

The Honors Program includes Advanced Placement courses, Advanced Level courses, and honors level work in designated MCPS Program of Studies courses. Data were collected from three sources: (1) student and teacher interviews at six high schools; (2) systemwide enrollment and performance data for the first semester; and (3) telephone interview comments from school administrators and guidance counselors. The study revealed findings in four areas: honors policy compliance; description of participating students; satisfaction with the Honors Program; and emerging problems.  Findings show that the MCPS Honors program is in place and being implemented according to county guidelines in all areas except foreign language. The curriculum is differentiated and challenging. Honors program students believe they are learning more and better. Recommendations include: (1) continuing effort to encourage Black and Hispanic student participation; (2) adding and subtracting certain Honors Program Courses; (3) improving procedures for students exiting at mid-semester; (4) investigating the advisabiliy of Cluster Classes and independent studies; and (5) providing more training guides and materials. Appendices contain three tables with data on participation in each Honors Program course by race, sex, and grade distributions for these courses. (BS)",

This is the first follow-up study of MCPS's 10 special education schools' graduates (class of 1983). It investigates: (1) postsecondary education and employment activities; (2) students' and/or parents' perceptions of program quality; (3) the effectiveness of these programs; and (4) current living arrangements for graduates. Telephone surveys were conducted with 92 (of 179) MCPS graduates, 48 parents, and 36 employers. Findings show that most graduates are either working in relatively low-skilled job categories or attending training institutions. However both parents and graduates at some schools felt MCPS could improve  its job training programs. Employers are satisfied with the work of the graduates and rate their job performance very highly. The Appendix contains descriptions of the MCPS special education programs for mental retardation (Concord, Longview, and Stephen Knolls schools), multiple handicaps (Rock Terrance High School), emotional impairment (the Regional Institute for Children and Adolescents in Rockville, Bridge School, and Mark Twain School), hearing impaired (Rockville High School) orthopedically and other health impaired (Kennedy High School), and specific learning disability (Walter Johnson, Gaithersburg, and Kennedy High Schools).

In the spring of 1983, three career components were evaluated by the Department of Educational Accountability: (1) the Executive Internship Program for selected eleventh and twelfth graders, started in the 1970's; (2) the School-Based Internship programs offered in many MCPS high schools since the 1960's; and (3) the Career Education Infusion Process (at the secondary level), which integrates curriculum with career education objectives for grades K-12 and was initiated in 1982. Quantitative survey research methods were used to collect data on the two internship  programs from participants, parents, sponsors, guidance counselors, and school coordinators. Semi-structured interviews of teachers, principals and other staff were used for the infusion process program. The study found the two internship programs strong and successful as of May, 1983, however, findings on the Career Education Infusion Process indicated little progress, and many barriers to the implementation process. An addendum contains a rejoinder by the Department of Career and Vocational Education Staff with charts of the career education guidance and instruction components. (BS)",

However, the substantial reduction in funding from the amount originally requested required the elimination of several proposed programs and services that addressed problems of fragmentation and risk teacher attrition. The amended proposal focused project efforts primarily on professional preparation for inner-city teachers and the development of school-based organzational structures. Using data from CUME Educational Specialists' activity logs and questionnaires from inservice workshop participants,  this evaluation found the 1983-84 CUME Project in compliance with the amended proposal. In spite of the positive findings the CUME Project, reduced in funding and consequently scope, was unable to strongly impact inner-city school problems. Consequently, it was recommended that: (1) CUME be eliminated unless there is sufficient funding to address problems of fragmentation and high teacher attribution; or (2) major problems be addressed at only two or three inner-city schools during the 1984-85 school year.

A total sum of $57,966 in Education Consolidation Improvement Act (ECIA) Chapter II funds were granted for the first year of this proposed 24 month project of the Dade County Florida Public Schools. An evaluation of the ACE project was undertaken to verify that the schools currently included in ASBMP were monitored, and to observe and document the process of induction of new schools into the program. Personnel from the Department of Career Education were interviewed and their records examined. It was recommended that the Department of Career Education (DCE) indicate a minimum acceptable level  of supervision, or monitoring, for the regular ASBMP program, in terms of a measureable criterion. Should the DCE determine that the designated minimum level of supervision of the regular program cannot be maintained with the present level of resources, while the remaining schools are being inducted into ASBMP, it was recommended that any requests for additional funding to increase temporary monitoring capabilities be favorably regarded.

This preliminary evaluation describes the planning objectives, and instructional activities which characterized the program and identifies parental preferences for program features. Data were collected from questionnaires mailed to parents of all gifted students and a survey of program teachers through visitations at all program sites. Problematic areas noted by  parents included the amount of time taken to identify and place children in the program, their understanding of grading standards, their knowledge of groups interested in gifted education, and regular program versus gifted program interaction. Parents were most supportive of the program objectives of creativity, problem solving, and communications skills and content areas including qualitative pursuits and hard sciences. Teacher lesson plans, objectives, and activities appeared appropriate at almost every site. Based on these findings, seven recommendations are made for program improvement.

        "description":"Recent calls for educational reform have focused on secondary schools, but results emerging from a cross-national study suggest that the reasons for American students' achievement problems lie not only in American schools but also in American homes. In the study, American, Taiwanese, and Japanese first and fifth graders were tested in reading and math, parents were interviewed, and classrooms were observed. Results showed that the American students were behind their Asian counterparts in both reading and math. The data indicate that the results cannot be explained by differences in cognitive ability, parents' educational status, or teacher training or experience. Major differences did appear, however, in the amount of time spent in school and in the proportion of school time  spent on instruction (less for Americans in both cases). Other differences included the following: (1) outside school, American children spent more time playing, performing household chores, and sleeping; (2) American mothers were the most positive about their children's performance and the most likely to value ability over effort; and (3) American mothers believed communication and taking an interest in their children to be the most important factors in helping them do well in school; a much greater number of Japanese mothers favored helping the child with homework, reading, and other school subjects.

        "description":"In the last 20 years, social science researchers have used a variety of methods to investigate the Asian Indian sub-culture in the United States. A national mail survey of over 200 Asian Indians uncovered a number of facts. The income, education, home ownership, and occupational profile of the sample projected an affluent image of the Asian Indian community. Only a minority of respondents had experienced discrimination and only 25% were supportive of the concept of a \"protected class status\" for Asian Indians. A majority had definite ideas about the public policy priorities of the American and Indian Governments and were very knowledgeable about pro- and anti-Indian politicians. Many Asian Indians are troubled by the image of India in the Western media, and have to rely on the  weekly Asian Indian community papers to know what is happening on the Indian sub-continent. Also, while the Asian Indian community is, in general, well-educated and affluent, there is an emerging need for support services. Other areas of concern include the status of women, the immigration laws, the quest for harmony between Sikhs and Hindus, employment discrimination (especially within the medical profession), the difficulty of obtaining religious education for Hindu youth, and the elderly. Some of these needs are being addressed by the growing number of Asian Indian organizations, but many issues deserve a closer study from a scholarly perspective. (KH)",

        "description":"This work explores whether a &quot;psychological price&quot; is indicated in the affective domain of the weaker student in abilty-mixed settings; whether this price differs for various dimensions of this domain; and whether it is related to academic achievement. Existing research in the fields of ability grouping, streaming, curriculum tracking, and ethnic segregation and integration is analyzed and supplemented by an in-depth study of two Israeli samples. A major finding is that the level of classroom intellectual composition is negatively related to evaluations of learning motivation and academic self-image but positively related to sense of control (and sometimes to aspirations), and analogously related to the positive effect of classroom composition on academic achievement. It is  suggested that different socio-psychological processes may affect achievement and certain affective variables differently than they do other affective variables. In the cognitive domain, and possibly in the case of control and aspirations, the class is more likely to function as a norm resource. In contrast, comparative reference seems to be more effective in influencing self-image. It is concluded that even if enrichment of intellectual composition involves the psychological price of a lower academic self-image and reduced motivation for the &quot;lows,&quot; their academic achievement is not reduced but increased.

Blanton Elementary And Horace Mann Junior to Miami Shores Elementary and North Miami Junior schools. From a list of 471 transferees, 33 were randomly selected and interviewed. A majority indicated that they transferred because the new schools were &quot;better,&quot; i.e., they had less fighting, fewer problems, greater concern by school administration and teachers for student well-being, books to take home, better facilities, better discipline, a majority White student body, and a better overall program. A review of achievement results indicated that median percentile  scores (reading and mathematics) were higher in Miami Shores Elementary and North Miami Junior than in the other two schools. Interviews with students currently enrolled at Horace Mann also pointed to many of the problems perceived by the transferring students, but their overall perception was not as negative. In the future, the School Board might: (1) conduct an in-depth review of educational program offerings and discipline at schools losing large numbers of students through transfers; (2) conduct a public relations campaign to accentuate the positive features of Van E. Blanton Elementary and Horace Mann Junior; and (3) consider amending current transfer procedures with a view toward ending transfers to schools that are utilized beyond their capacity. (KH)",

The reports fail to recognize the unique context of urban education and, in general, tend to remove education from its social context. Surprisingly, in a country where over a quarter of all students are from ethnic minorities, the current reports are nearly silent on the special needs of these students. The recommendations for reform need to address school issues with a clearer understanding of their urban context in at least the nine following areas: educational goals; academic achievement  and diversity; student tracking and promotion; resources and planning; support services; curriculum and instruction; language instruction; vocational education; and technology.

        "description":"The Reagan Administration opposes proposed legislation (Senate 377) that would provide special assistance, including temporary stays of deportation, for El Salvadoran nationals illegally in the United States. First, such legislation will accomplish nothing that cannot be done better or more equitably under the Refugee Act of 1980, which established a comprehensive system under which any person, regardless of origin, can apply for and receive individual consideration of the merits of his or her claim to asylum or refugee status. Senate (S) 377 would circumvent the basic policy behind the 1980 Act and return to the ad hoc and discriminatory approach of the past. As for claims that S. 377 would eliminate discriminatory Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) policy against  Salvadoran asylum applicants, any such claims must be challenged. There is no discrimination against Salvadorans. Asylum applications that demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution are granted. Those that are poorly documented or patently frivolous are not. A second reason for the Administration's opposition to S. 377 is that it will undermine enforcement of the Immigration and Nationality Act. It will have a magnet effect, encouraging high levels of continuing illegal entry from Central America. It is unlikely that after expiration of the temporary stays, the Salvadorans will return home voluntarily or the INS will be able to locate and remove them. Thus, the Senate should consider S. 377 in the total immigration context and not support it. (KH)",

The fourth section discusses the difficulties of putting into practice the ideas put forward in the preceding sections. The next section provides a list of resources: (1) books and articles by and about Freire; (2) the application of Freire in the United States and in other countries, and other examples of liberatory education; (3) group dynamics and samples of exercises and activities; (4) facilitator training manuals, and plans for facilitator formation workshops developed by projects in the Educacion Liberadora Network; and (5)  resources not in any other category.

        "description":"On this 20th anniversary of the passage of the Arizona Civil Rights Act, the State is to be congratulated for its successes in civil rights enforcement. The significance of the passage of the Act is twofold: (1) it added the full weight of State law enforcement to the battle against unlawful discrimination; and (2) it underscored the continuing vitality of the Federalist system of Government. The Reagan Administration is committed to the Federalist system, and has fostered a newer and more lasting appreciation of the sovereignty of State and local governments, insisting that there is more than enough room for effective law enforcement at the Federal level without preempting all State and local powers. Congress, however, does not agree. The Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1985  proposed by Congress would introduce more comprehensive Federal civil rights legislation and usurp many of the State law protections already in place. Instead of going ahead with this legislation, Congress should survey the civil rights scene carefully and erect new legislative protections only as needed and only if carefully tailored to meet a demonstrated need.

Subcommittee on Oversight and Subcommittee on Public Assistance and Unemployment Compensation of the Committee on Ways and Means. U.S. House of Representatives, 98th Congress, 2nd Session.",
        "description":"Possible causes for the rapid increase in the poverty rate from 1980 to 1982 were investigated, with two factors in particular being considered: the impact of the welfare program provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (OBRA), and the recessionary economy experienced during that year. The basic study design used a computer simulation of four fiscal year 1982 economic and legislative scenarios representing the following: (1) a baseline poverty population during fiscal 1982 under the assumption of a stronger economy and without the OBRA changes that took effect; (2) the combined effects of OBRA and recession on the poverty rate; (3) the independent effects of OBRA welfare program changes on poverty; and (4) the independent effects of the weak economy on the  poverty rate. Major findings include the following: (1) the relative impact of the economy was greater than OBRA, but OBRA's impact on poverty among children and female headed families was stronger (while the economy affected working adults and married couple families more severely); (2) OBRA increased poverty by 2 percent and the weak economy increased poverty by 6 percent, for a combined increase of 8 percent. Following the narrative, study methods and poverty rate estimates are discussed in appendices. (Many statistical tables are included in the text) (KH)",

        "description":"The effectiveness of bilingual bicultural education as a means of increasing the opportunities of language minority students is examined in this report, which is addressed to educators and the general public. First, an introduction defines key terms, briefly outlines controversies which surround bilingual education, and describes the contents of the report. Three chapters follow, focusing on different aspects of the central topic. Chapter 1 provides a historical overview of language minorities and education and then focuses on the needs of today's mostly Spanish-speaking immigrants, and the recent public policies affecting them. In Chapter 2, the English as a Second Language approach is analyzed for purposes of comparison and the educational principles underlying the bilingual  approach are discussed. In Chapter 3, to clarify what bilingual bicultural programs are and how they work, selected bilingual programs are described, and information is provided on evaluation procedures for such programs. Finally, a brief conclusion discusses the report's implications and asserts that bilingual bicultural education is the program of instruction that currently offers the best vehicle for large number of language minority students who experience language difficulty in the schools. Appendices include discussions of the constitutional right of non-English speaking children to equal educational opportunity, and Federal and State policy on bilingual education. (KH)",

        "description":"In January 1982, the Maryland Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights conducted a forum in order to hear from community representatives, members of the Montgomery County School Board, and other local officials about the impact of school board decisions to close selected schools in the countywide school district. On the basis of the information gathered in preparation for, at, and following the meeting, the committee came to the following conclusions. First, while the committee recognized the need for school closings due to dwindling enrollments, it found that the decisionmaking process utilized by the school board did not adequately consider either the racial makeup of the county's schools or the special needs of the county's various minority  communities. Second, the school board's insensitivity to minority community concerns added racial tension to the controversy and polarized it in a manner that could damage community relations for a long time to come. And finally, in choosing schools to be closed, the school board deviated from its own racial balance policies; its actions would result in increased minority concentrations in schools in certain areas of the county. In the light of these findings, the committee urges the United States Commission on Civil Rights to conduct a national assessment of school closures necessitated by declining enrollments. Following the narrative, appendices present two responses to the committee's findings by the school board president and a school board member. (RDN)",

First, Title IX is discussed, with particular focus on its specific references to pregnancy and parenting and its outline of ways in which schools cannot discriminate against pregnant or parenting students or employees. Other laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of pregnancy or sex are summarized briefly. Next, a step-by-step guide is provided for assessing equitable treatment. A detailed process is outlined for evaluating equity in the four major areas where school-based discrimination against pregnant and  parenting students is most commonly found: (1) admission to programs and activities; (2) treatment in regular programs and activities; (3) treatment in special or separate schools, classes, programs, and activities; and (4) availability and quality of pregnancy-related health services. Two appendices contain the actual wording of the major portions of the Title IX regulations that deal with pregnancy and parenting, and charts for assessing equity in programs, policies, and services.

Examples of the violation of the due process clause would be to implement a testing program without adequate notice or to cover material not taught. Instructional validity must be shown, preferably by a formal study by an outside or unbiased agency. The Equal Protection clause is violated when a disproportionate impact due to present effects of past intentional discrimination is shown. Three cases that mark milestones in testing are Griggs v. Duke Power Co., Washington v. Davis, and Debra P. v. Turlington. These three cases show consumers of competency testing for basic skills or occupational skills that  documentation of different kinds of validity is necessary. Other cases have challenged the requirement of test passage as a diploma requirement, shown that tests can not be used for a purpose other than that for which they have been validated, and emphasized that tests can not perpetuate the effects of past discrimination.

Those interviewed expressed concern that the May 1984 reduction-in-force (RIF) at ETA has resulted in low staff morale, lost program expertise among ETA staff, and lost program efficiency and program delays. Concern was also expressed over the fact that the  States have received only limited policy guidance from ETA while, at the same time, having been subject to close scrutiny through audits and evaluations by OIG, ETA, and the GAO.

The BLS was asked to perform two sets of computer simulations in order to show the relative impacts of five determinants--gross national product (GNP), demand distribution, productivity, input-output coefficients, and staffing pattern ratios--on the 1995 BLS employment projections. In the first set of simulations, one determinant at a time was assigned its 1995 projected value, while the others were held constant at their 1977 values. In the second set of  simulations, BLS was asked to reverse the procedure used for the first set, to use 1982 as the benchmark year, and to make the analysis for all workers rather than solely for wage-and-salary workers. The results of these simulations suggested that labor productivity is likely to increase substantially and that changes in input-output coefficients will increase the demand for labor in the industries examined. (Attachments to this report include a detailed explanation of the BLS employment forecasting system and tables summarizing the results of the two sets of simulations.) (MN)",

From the 241 extension agents working in the 88 counties of Ohio, researchers selected a random sample of 101 agents. Included in the sample were 34 agriculture agents, 33 home economics agents. Included in the sample agents were asked to complete a survey questionnaire designed to collect data concerning personal, organizational, and job (environmental) factors. Of the 91 surveys returned, 89 were usable. The Ohio extension agents were found to experience a low to moderate level of burnout, with less than 20 percent of them appearing to manifest a high level of burnout. In general, the younger agents--those between the ages of 20 and 30--experienced higher levels of burnout. Males and females  experienced the same relative levels of burnout, with single individuals undergoing significantly higher levels of burnout than their married counterparts. Job satisfaction was the best single predictor of burnout when all significant independent variables were entered in a stepwise regression equation. As a group, the 4-H agents experienced more burnout than did the agriculture or home economics agents. (MN)",

A 30-item questionnaire was mailed to each of the 677 institutions across the United States that were identified as using either CACG system. Of those institutions contacted, 438 completed questionnaires, yielding a 64.7 percent response rate. Most of those institutions using a CACG system did so on microcomputers. The systems were used more widely in smaller than in larger schools. Some postsecondary institutions were using the systems as recruitment tools and, although neither system was designed for use by adults, adult students were said to be  requesting and receiving services involving CACG. In many cases, CACG systems were being used as an integral part of traditional career guidance and educational services. In many cases, however, institutions have not engaged in the planning, staff training, and evaluation efforts necessary to deliver services that allow clients to obtain the full measure of benefits possible with this technology. To improve the use of CACG systems, professional associations, system developers, and user groups must establish standards for the provision of services. (The survey instrument is appended.) (MN)",

In particular, the study examines how public policies affect the entrepreneurial process in America, and what the government's role should be in fostering an improved environment for economic growth and technological innovation. A basic conclusion of the study is that many of the shackles that stifled entrepreneurial activity in the past several decades have been removed, at least partially. As a consequence, America is now experiencing an economic rejuvenation in its old and new industries as a result of a vibrant entrepreneurial community. Entrepreneurship cannot be taught but it can be  nurtured by public policies that improve the climate for innovation. Some public policy changes that are contributing to the current entrepreneurial activities are (1) the rapid growth of venture capital resulting from changes in tax laws and pension fund regulations; (2) the complete turnabout in inflationary psychology after 1980 from one of high inflationary expectations to one of low inflationary expectations; (3) deregulation of domestic industries; (4) changes in patent regulations; (5) the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980; (6) lower tax rates; (7) a new macroeconomic management philosophy which emphasizes stable growth; (8) continued strong Federal support for basic research; and (9) continued strong resistance to domestic protectionists' pressures. The current  challenge is to continue the policies that are working and initiate others to continue and encourage growth in entrepreneurship. (KC)",

Completed surveys were returned by 1,586 (44 percent) of the facilities, of which 864 (54 percent of the respondents) are using computers. The users indicated that computers are most frequently used for administrative purposes, whereas production and rehabilitation services uses are much less frequent. A number of statistical analyses were significant. It was found that the facilities that are currently using computers are much larger in terms of the number of clients they serve, the number of employees, and the size of their annual budgets. The users also provide a wider variety of rehabilitation services than the nonusers. Almost one-half of the current computer users own a  microcomputer, one-quarter own a minicomputer, and only a few own a mainframe computer. There were sizeable differences in the costs of purchasing and operating these three classes of computers. However, there was no difference in terms of user satisfaction between the three classes of computer users. The results indicated that there is a substantial need for both customized software and for short-term training on how to use computers effectively in facilities. It was also found that the use and ownership of computers by facilities is likely to rise dramatically in the near future. Most of the facilities that will be acquiring a new computer system will be purchasing a microcomputer. (Author/KC)",

This report addresses the perceived needs and levels of independence experienced by these two distinct populations as a result of a follow-up study conducted in July, 1984. The questionnaire used in 1983 was revised to focus upon services used and levels of consumer satisfaction. Areas addressed were demographics, education, employment and training, income and benefits, housing, recreation and leisure time, transportation, medical treatment, counseling, advocacy, and legal issues. The objective of the study was to  determine the level of consumer use of and satisfaction with community-based services, use of and satisfaction with independent living services, and what, if any, differences exist between those in institutionalized and non-institutionalized groups regarding perceived needs, levels of independence, and satisfaction with available resources. Although the sample size was too small to yield definitive results overall, the findings indicated that people living in the community reported greater satisfaction and better use of both generic and categorical services. When services were not used, reasons given included lack of transportation, prohibitive cost, or lack of interest. (Author/KC)",

To investigate local approaches, chapter II surveys five leaders in one sample state (Iowa) in which community colleges participate actively in local economic development strategies. It offers a consensus opinion on what guidelines a community college should follow when becoming involved in local economic development efforts. Chapter III focuses on how community, junior, and technical colleges work together at the State level to pursue economic development in  States with varying emphases and levels of commitment to organized economic development. Relevant activity at the National level is also reviewed. Chapter IV contains practical information and ideas in the form of case studies of seven projects undertaken by community colleges to advance economic development at all three levels.

After a technical advisory committee generated and prioritized a list of tasks typically performed by child care administrators, a tentative course overview was developed. Eighteen of the 24 child care administrators who expressed an interest in taking the course were selected to receive training on the use of word processing, file management, electronic spread sheets, and accounting as these apply to administration of child care programs using a microcomputer. The 15 individuals who completed the pilot course were quite satisfied with the course in general as well as with the course instructor and the materials covered in  class. (Appendixes to this report, which comprise 75 percent of the document, include a project time line, a list of administrative tasks for a child care facility, results of advisory committee brainstorming, the questionnaire designed to prioritize the tasks involved in administering a child care program, a course publicity brochure, a course interview form, tentative and revised course outlines, weekly class evaluations, and an outline for the project-developed resource guides for students and instructors.)

These modules were designed to provide supplementary instruction in five content areas critical to the safe and efficient operation of motor vehicles by young drivers--speed management, alcohol, restraint usage, hazard perception (pedestrian and cyclist hazards only), and energy efficient driving. Research activities determined what should be taught and how knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors should be communicated for maximum efficiency. Ten instructional modules were prepared--three in the area of alcohol, four on restraint usage, and one each in the other three content areas. An evaluation of module effectiveness  indicated that the speeding module, the restraint modules, and an alcohol module focusing on the need to intervene when others are in drinking-driving situations were capable of improving behavior. The other two alcohol modules and the fuel-efficiency module improved knowledge and attitudes but failed to induce behavioral change. Neither was behavioral improvement observed in connection with the hazard perception module. (Forty tables and eight figures are provided.) (YLB)",

        "description":"The federally funded Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs) Program was designed to permit centers the structural flexibility to meet a wide range of local conditions. Although centers differ along many dimensions, it is possible to classify them into two basic structural models based on whether inpatient care is provided by the grantee directly (Inpatient Provider CMHCs) or indirectly through an affiliate (Inpatient Affiliated CMHCs). Changes in funding, clientele, and services from 1971 to 1980 were examined cross-sectionally and with cohorts for Inpatient Provider and Inpatient Affiliated CMHCs. The results indicated that Inpatient Provider CMHCs grew in revenues and shifted from reliance on federal funds to revenues from services and states, while Inpatient Affiliated CMHCs  fell in revenues and changed little in their proportional reliance on federal dollars. Inpatient Provider CMHCs also averaged more additions and episodes of care than Inpatient Affiliated centers. Inpatient Affiliated centers grew more from 1971 to 1976, but from 1976 to 1980 Inpatient Provider centers grew, while Inpatient Affiliated centers dropped or grew less. The data support the notion that organizational structure is an important differentiating variable in describing and evaluating federally funded CMHCs. (The appendix contains three tables and nine figures depicting revenue changes and service additions for CMHCs from 1971 to 1980.) (NRB)",

        "description":"Many surveys of school psychologists have documented their desire to devote more time to consultation--an indirect service delivery system in which the school psychologist interacts with a consultee (teacher, parent, other professional) for purposes of solving a client problem. To expand the work of Martin and Curtis (1981) on school psychologists' attributions regarding consultation outcomes, questionnaires were completed by 234 school psychologists who reported their attributions for success and failure in consultation. The results indicated that the type of problem presented for consultation was predominantly a student problem involving behavior or academic difficulties and the client was most likely to be a boy in elementary or middle school. The results from chi-square  analyses were highly significant, indicating that the psychologists attributed approximately 22 percent of successful cases and only 6 percent of failures to themselves. Conversely, they attributed 42 percent of successful cases and 77 percent of failures to the consultee. Respondents were more likely to report failure with teacher consultees compared to parent or parent-teacher consultees. Comparisons of psychologist characteristics with reasons for success or failure revealed that psychologists with a wide range of experience and characteristics were similar in their attributions. (Suggestions for training programs in school psychology drawn from these findings are discussed.) (NRB)",

        "description":"Considerable evidence has been found to support the hypothesis that actors' and observers' attributions diverge. It is also becoming clear that this divergence is not the result of a single process, but is the result of factors which co-occur and differentiate actors from observers. Observers' beliefs about their similarity to actors were manipulated in two studies to see whether attributional differences between actors and observers covary with informational differences. In the first study, 90 male undergraduates served either as actors, similar observers, or dissimilar observers. Actors either succeeded or failed in changing another's attitude. Significant actor-observer effects occurred on most attribution measures: open-ended internality, actor's motivation, task difficulty,  and luck. Similar observers' attributions almost always fell between actors' and dissimilar observers' attributions. In the second study, 175 observers rated a fictional other's personality as less dependent &quot;on the situation&quot; when s/he was more dissimilar. The results support an informational, rather than a perspective or motivational explanation for the actor-observer divergence. (NRB)",

        "description":"Little is known about the power strategies adolescents view as effective in influencing an intimate partner to have or avoid having sexual intercourse. These strategies were examined in a pretest survey of 203 adolescents who reported their agreement or disagreement with strategies used to have protected sex or to avoid having sex with a girl/boyfriend. The results indicated that in avoiding sex, adolescents preferred a direct and unilateral strategy; in seeking protected sex, they preferred a direct and bilateral strategy. The unilateral, indirect approach was the least preferred strategy regardless of sexual goal. The findings also showed that gender, age, and ethnicity were significantly related to agreement with power strategy use; minority, female, and younger adolescents  agreed more, in general, to all strategies to avoid and to have sex. A posttest survey was completed by 146 adolescents who had completed a Health Belief Model training project designed to train adolescents to use effective strategies in intimate relationships. Posttest results indicated that the project had little influence on the overall preference rankings of strategies. Participants gained in terms of desirable strategies to have protected sex, but were not generally affected in terms of strategies to avoid sexual intercourse.

The quality of life in our society increasingly has been influenced by human service professionals. Motivational problems for these professionals can adversely affect their performance and can occur anytime in their training or careers; however, there is evidence suggesting that initial career experiences can be particularly important. An in-depth, longitudinal study of 28 new human service professionals (lawyers, nurses, mental health professionals, and high school teachers) revealed that the work motivation of many new professionals declined during the first year of their careers. The amount of motivational decline seemed to be  strongly related to the degree of stress which they encountered in their jobs. Four aspects of the job were particularly important as sources of stress: ambiguity, professional-bureaucratic role conflict, professional-client relationship, and the absence of formal, organizational concern about the quality of work life. These stress areas suggest several motivational strategies to be employed in pre-service training and on the job that could help new professionals sustain their motivation, e.g., interpersonal helping skills, organizational conflict resolution skills, and management development.

Yet, middle adulthood has been neglected as an area of theoretical and empirical examination. Adults (N=251) in middle adulthood (age 35-55) completed instruments measuring current health status, health locus of control, health value, health habits, self-management effectiveness, stressful life events, social support, genetic predisposition, gender, level of education, and income. The results indicated that internal locus of control was positively related to total self-management, health self-management, and health habits, while chance locus and powerful others locus were negatively related to  these behavioral variables. The strongest predictors positively related to health were internal locus of control and health habits. The strongest predictors inversely related to health were powerful others locus, genetic predisposition, and less-than-high school education. Although some factors not readily modifiable for middle-aged adults were found to contribute to health status, modifiable attitudinal and behavioral varibles were also found to be important: even in cases with high genetic predisposition to disease, good health habits appeared to make a significant difference.

Groups have been organized for therapeutic, supportive, or orientational purposes with general medical-surgical patients. Group work for the medically ill may serve not only to prepare members to understand and use medical technology but also to assist them in accepting change in their health status and in continuing as a functional part of the family and community. The holistic health movement lends impetus to the use of group interventions by providing evidence that the presence of an empathic support system may have beneficial effects on physiological  functioning, and that information may aid ill persons to retain a perception of control over their health, thus promoting optimal physical functioning. Investigations of group work in medicine have revealed nine therapeutic factors which can help patients: information, clarification, universality, catharsis, peer support, interaction, helper therapy, modeling, and confrontation. Data from these studies suggest that the use of groups for psychosocial intervention is an effective tool in the care of the physically ill. (NRB)",

To explore the training and employment patterns of doctoral level counseling, developmental, educational, and school psychologists, data were gathered from 45 doctorate-granting universities, 55 comprehensive colleges and universities, and the second 100 largest corporate employers. In addition, the linkage strategies used by these respondents were examined. Participants from these training programs and industrial corporations completed questionnaires on their anticipated training and employment patterns for selected behavioral scientists over the period 1983-1988, and on possible strategies to cope with changing employment patterns. Usable data from 45 academic  respondents and 13 industrial respondents indicated that admission patterns varied widely among the different training programs, and suggested that these programs required varying numbers of years of graduate training. Employment patterns for the selected doctoral level psychologists indicated that inexperienced Ph.D. psychologists would find no employment in industry, but that new Ph.D.'s in counseling and school psychology would have more employment opportunities in academia than would developmental and educational psychologists. The findings indicate that training programs are doing little to enhance their students' marketability with industry.

Subjects were randomly assigned to either a highly structured or a less structured version of the same program. Data from pre- and posttest structured interviews were used to classify clients' belongingness type (isolate, dyad, cluster, variant). Treatment outcome was measured by length of stay in the program and rate of relapse. The findings indicated no significant relationship between program structure and belongingness level change. There was a  significant relationship between belongingness posttest level and length of stay, and between belongingness posttest level and relapse rate. Program structure was found to have a significant relationship to length of stay but not to relapse rate. These results support the importance of a high level of client belongingness to successful treatment outcome. However, the results indicate that the highly structured program format should be questioned as to whether or not it is the most effective strategy for achieving desired results. (NRB)",

The cognitive approach (Beck) posits that depression derives from negatively distorted beliefs that must be challenged in the context of cognitive therapy until they are replaced with positive and realistic thought patterns. The behavioral approach (Lewinsohn) views depression as a consequence of reinforcement deprivation, suggesting that treatment be directed toward increasing the frequency and variety of pleasure-producing activities. Clients (N=40) seeking service at a university counseling center were randomly assigned to one of four treatment conditions (cognitive, behavioral, combined, control). Pre- and post-test measures of  depression included four cognitive measures, three behavioral scales, and two diagnostic inventories. Analysis of data revealed that the cognitive treatment factor produced a consistent and durable impact on devices reflecting cognitive manifestations of depression; some generalization to the behavioral domain occurred as well. The behavioral factors failed to produce improvement within the corresponding behavioral assessment battery or on any cognitive device. The obtained pattern of convergent and divergent outcomes indicated considerable construct-valid strength for cognitive therapy applied to a moderately depressed population. (Author/NRB)",

Blacks and other ethnic minorities are also under-represented in allied health and other health professions. Yet it is anticipated that an increase in the number of minorities trained as health professionals will result in higher quality health care for minorities. A study was undertaken to determine whether sex-role stereotyping by high school counselors posed a significant barrier to black males interested in allied health careers. A three-part questionnaire was mailed to 360 high school counselors. The first part obtained counselor ratings of the percentage of males and females working in nine health professions, and their perception of the level of ability needed  for each profession. Part II consisted of three student profiles, a rating scale for student ability, and a list of nine professions from part I; the third part of the questionnaire asked for demographic information from respondents. The results of data analyses showed that in general, careers selected for males were perceived to be male dominated and careers selected for females were perceived to be female dominated across ability levels. The only exceptions were high-ability black females and average ability black males. The mean of the male/female scores for selected careers for all students at each ability-level was lowest for average-ability students (with the exception of average-ability white males) and the highest for high-ability students. The findings indicate that counselors  demonstrate less bias toward male dominated careers when advising average students, suggesting that average ability black males are more readily advised toward allied health careers than are high-ability black males.

The aim of this unit is to explore aspects of social policy relating to child welfare by focusing on policy development, legislative framework, and the application of principles to practice. Because this module was developed for use at the University of Southern Maine, some material pertains specifically to Maine's child welfare law and may require modification for use in other states. An overview of the course is provided, five learning objectives are listed, and the course outline is presented. Materials in this outline examine child welfare from several perspectives. The history of child welfare services in this  country is reviewed, key issues faced by decision-makers regarding the welfare of children are identified, and recent federal and state legislation affecting the delivery of child welfare services is discussed. The unit then focuses on a specific example of social welfare policy-making by examining recent changes in Maine's foster care program. The course outline is followed by six questions for discussion and a list of suggested readings. (NRB)",

The extent to which older persons' assessments of their lives are influenced by their place of residence was examined through structured interviews with a random sample of 400 persons aged 60 and older, living in a middle class urban community. Subjects completed the Life Satisfaction Index A and measures assessing personality characteristics, demographic variables, socioeconomic status, life stage, activity patterns, and environmental experiences. The results revealed statistically significant direct effects of nine social and physical environment experiences on older people's life satisfaction. In addition, nine  individual variables were found to independently influence life satisfaction. The individual differences and environmental experiences together explained nearly half of the statistical variation in the older people's life satisfaction levels.

In this light, it is suggested that students in graduate programs in school psychology could benefit from specialized education and experience in applied neuropsychology. A neuropsychology graduate training model, which capitalizes on the applied psychometric and learning theory emphasis in school psychology training, is offered as an accent to school psychology. The objective of this training is presented as the preparation of psychologists who could apply neuropsychological principles to the understanding of problems which arise as the child interacts with the educational process. The  5-year doctoral training model is presented in outline form. Courses are listed for two semesters per year for the first 4 years, with the fifth year dedicated to an internship and dissertation.

There is increasing evidence that emotional distress is an occupational hazard for physicians. Measures exploring the relationships between occupational stress, social support, locus of control, and depression were administered to a group of 210 family physicians. The results indicated that occupational stress exerted a direct effect on depression. This relationship was moderated directly by family social and emotional support and indirectly by the influence of locus of control on family social support. Support from peers was not significantly related to depression.

Although children can expect to play a minimal role in supporting their parents until the parents reach old age, a divorce in the parents' middle years may lead them to call on their children for help. Male (N=16) and female (N=16) college students who had experienced the divorce of their parents completed questionnaires about patterns of family support. In follow-up questionnaires, the students rated changes in the amount of support they both give and receive from parents, siblings, and grandparents. Questions focused on financial support, emotional support, and provision of goods and services. The results revealed that the majority of sons  and daughters experienced altered patterns of exchange with their parents following divorce. Generally, their exchange relationships intensified, as both parents and children increased the assistance they provided one another. The analyses suggested that the gender of the child influenced post-divorce patterns of support; sons were more likely than daughters to increase the support they received from their parents following divorce. The gender of the parent also emerged as an important determinant of post-divorce exchange patterns. (NRB)",

Because subjects display variability in patterns of behavior change, increased understanding of these individual differences could be beneficial to interventions.

Adolescents provided data on daily drug, alcohol, and cigarette use for an 18-month period, along with school report cards and periodic self-report inventories. The intervention consisted of (1) identifying undesirable events; (2) assessing antecedents and consequences through weekly meetings; (3) focusing on the complaints; (4) teaching the family  problem-solving techniques; and (5) encouraging consistent contingencies and modeling desired behaviors. The first two adolescents in the program showed widely differing patterns in almost every index except outcome; they both showed improvement by the end of follow-up in the two targeted behaviors (school performance and drug use) and showed no change in the two control, non-targeted behaviors (alcohol and cigarette use).

Data were collected by nine social service/health agencies on 50 cases of abuse/neglect and 50 control cases. Through a series of discriminant function data reduction analyses, nine risk indicators were identified which were 94 percent accurate in classifying cases into abuse/neglect and  control groups. Three questions directed to the elderly were significant (did anyone take money or property, did anyone threaten to hurt the elder,and are the elder's needs being met), as were two characteristics of the elder (no related cause of symptoms, elder seen as source of stress), and four characteristics of the caretaker (tried to make elder act against own best interest, inappropriate awareness of elder's condition, financial dependence on elder, and persistent lying).

The method presented equips teachers with an eight-step strategy for helping students think through everyday decisions and stressful situations. The materials target situations that children face while interacting with their peers and adjusting to school. Five major tasks facing new middle school students are identified: (1) managing shifts in role definitions and expectations; (2) managing shifts in social networks and group membership; (3) reorganizing personal social support resources; (4) reappraising oneself and one's life situation; and (5) managing the stress related to uncertain expectations, goals, and abilities. An action-research  methodology designed to develop sound curriculum materials for the fourth and fifth grades is presented. Empirical findings concerning the impact of stressors related to the middle school transition on students and the effects of this training on their ability to cope with these stressors are reviewed. Finally, there is a description of a new, ongoing experimental extension of the elementary school program through the discipline system of the middle school, the focus of this effort being to help students think through situations that result in frequent school discipline episodes.

        "description":"Consultants' goal is to have clients understand and accept their findings and to use them for constructive reform, yet unwelcomed findings may be dismissed, suppressed, or distorted. There are several strategies which consultants can use to communicate unwelcomed findings. The consultant can prepare the groundwork in the original negotiation of the contract to establish honest self-appraisal, and, in order to avoid ethical dilemmas, refuse consultations which are likely to be exercises in flattery or scapegoating. They should also be aware of and reduce their anxieties about giving certain findings and be aware of their own motives for giving either welcomed or unwelcomed findings. The timing of information to clients is important; it is often useful to give informal feedback  along the way, and giving too much feedback at one time can overload the client. Too often consultants stop at the analysis of the problem. It is important to move beyond unwelcomed findings to solutions. Ideally, a consultant should put the findings in context, and communicate neutrality toward the findings, but empathy toward the client. These techniques can improve consultants' chances of having unwelcomed findings used for constructive change. (NRB)",

The theoretical and empirical literature on the intersection of work and family roles is reviewed from two analytical approaches. From the individual level of analysis, the literature reviewed reveals three theoretical models which assert: (1) that work and family are separate role environments (segmented); (2) that work and family roles are antithetical (compensatory); or (3) that work and family roles are fundamentally similar (spillover). Literature from the couple's level of analysis is then reviewed which presents evidence for the existence of an inter-spouse relationship. Based on this review, a conceptual framework is  proposed. Included is a table which lists all possible combinations of work and family involvement between two spouses. These 24 combinations are then collapsed into four general patterns: all roles symmetric; all roles asymmetric; symmetric family-asymmetric work; and asymmetric family-symmetric work. Each of these patterns is described and their place in the existing literature is examined. (Author/NRB)",

To determine if and how these programs produce youths who can find and keep a job, 3-year follow-up data were compared for a national sample of 419 employment training program participants and 356 non-participants of comparable background. Analysis of results showed significantly more months of employment and significantly higher wages for the participants than for the non-participants. These differences were sustained after controlling for the effects of age, sex, race/ethnicity, economic status, local unemployment rate, and preprogram levels  of education and reading ability. These effects were greatest in programs which emphasized work experience or on-the-job training. Participant-control differences in months of employment were greater for minority than non-minority youth, and greater for females than for males. Despite these significant results, background, previous education, and local unemployment rates were shown to have a greater effect on economic outcomes than did program participation. (Author/MCF)",

        "description":"This paper examines the potential influence of school reform policies on the high school dropout rate. We summarize a diverse set of reports on American education which recommend increasing academic standards in schools as a means for improving secondary school performance. We also describe our understanding of the processes by which youngsters drop out of school. In light of these diverse literatures, we show that raising standards may have both positive and negative consequences for potential dropouts. On the positive side, raising standards may encourage greater student effort and time on schoolwork, and thus lead to higher levels of achievement. On the negative side, raising the standards may increase academic stratification within schools and cause more school failure, with  no apparent remedies. Because of these potential negative consequences of raising standards, we assess the literature on intervention programs designed to reduce delinquent behavior and school dropout. We suggest that alterable organizational characteristics of schools can help buffer the potentially negative consequences of raising academic standards for students at risk of dropping out. We conclude by calling for rigorous evaluations of the implementation and measurable effects of school reform efforts, in the context of a &quot;full enrollment model&quot; of program effectiveness.

        "description":"A study focusing on anxiety and its interaction with reading explored the undetermined potential of prequestions for treating high reading-related anxiety. The research sample was comprised of 151 members of the freshman nursing classes at a large southeastern university. Evaluation materials included commercial reading tests as well as questions developed by the researchers. After all students were tested initially, 49 found to have high reading anxiety and low comprehension skills met in the next session for subsequent tests. Results show that serious evidence can be promulgated for considering poor ability as a contributing factor to high reading anxiety and not the inverse. High anxiety related to poor reading ability had no effect on reading comprehension tasks, even when  adjunct prequestions were provided and anxiety was relatively high. It seems likely that a history of reading failure acts to inflate anxiety related to reading, so the direction may be from poor reading ability to high anxiety. Poor readers with high anxiety need more and better reading skill improvement. Teachers eager to use prequestions should consider alternative reading aids. (DF)",

After identifying four strategies that merited investigation, the instructional mode (reciprocal teaching) was selected. The metacognitive environment in which the instruction was instituted was then analyzed, and the basic instructional package was investigated in a series of five studies in which the teacher was either the investigator, a volunteer reading teacher, a recruited reading teacher, or a peer tutor. The setting was a resource room or classroom; the content was either selected  expository passages from basal texts or science material; and the students were seventh graders having difficulty in comprehending. Results showed that dialogue and comprehension improved substantially over time. This work suggests that an effective reading instruction program requires the identification of complementary strategies that are modeled by an expert and acquired by the learner in a context reinforcing the usefulness of such strategies.

        "description":"An organizational framework consisting of the following four components is useful in exploring questions about improving textbooks: learner characteristics, learning activities, the critical task (for measuring student performance), and the nature of the materials. In considering learning characteristics and the materials, it is important to remember the crucial transition for children from basal reader prose to the prose in content area textbooks. In a study focusing on children's interest in social studies textbooks, it was shown that children find these texts uninteresting and difficult. This may be because their textbooks do not foster the learning skills necessary for understanding and remembering information. Some fundamental changes thus need to take place concerning what  content area textbooks should be. Rhetorical textbooks that use metadiscourse to convey both content information and the author's attitudes toward it may advance the goals of learning from written texts and producing texts. Striking text differences between conventional and unconventional textbooks emphasize the need for an indepth study in order to improve the quality of all textbooks for children, not just those in social studies.

Since this process has not been explored in great depth, a study examined the relation of the production rule representation to transfer of training. Subjects learned procedures for operating a simple piece of equipment by reading step-by-step instructions. By measuring the reading time on individual steps and the accuracy of execution of the procedure, the acquisition of individual production rules was tracked. Since the procedures are related, some transfer of training was possible from procedures learned earlier. Results show that  production rules, as a way to represent procedural knowledge, can provide a detailed account of the learning process, and that the transfer process is more similar to comprehension processes than to conventional practice mechanisms or Anderson's (1982) learning principles.

Seventy dictated stories created in an earlier study, along with 4 first-grade level stories from the &quot;Reader's Digest Skill Builder&quot; series, served as the pool for various analyses. Factors of traditional readability, interest, story structure, and reality were examined to learn why children infer better on student-generated texts than on adult-generated texts. Analyses showed that interest, natural language leading to longer sentences, and social and conceptual schema matches hold higher explanatory power than traditional measures of readability and  story structure. Teachers who may have been reluctant to use student-generated texts because they are not &quot;controlled&quot; can be assured that strong factors support the readability of such texts.

This essay discusses the rights and responsibilities of that relationship by presenting writing and reading as a rhetorical situation--an interaction between author, reader/learner, text, and the world--that involves the structuring of meaning. The point of providing students with opportunities to structure ideas through writing is to help them develop schemata for idea structuring, which they can transfer to the reading situation. With these schemata, readers can uncover the author's structure more successfully, or impose their own structure on a text. The text, rather than bearing meaning explicitly, represents  meaning or gives clues to meaning. The author must provide enough clues for the reader, and the reader must appropriately use the author's clues. It is possible that students who have previously experienced various text types by writing them will be better readers and recallers of those same text types. (HTH)",

Specifically, it examined what happens when writers are asked to read about an unfamiliar topic and then use that information to write an argument. A student was requested to complete four tasks that represented stages one might go through to write an argumentative essay: reading a passage, recalling the passage, planning the argument using the reading material, and writing the argument. Results of this case study show that there are certain things to consider in writing based on reading. For example, text has such an influence that it is often difficult for writers to move beyond the ideas and even the original language of a text. In addition, the ways writers generate and elaborate ideas from  reading for writing show the influence of the writers' real world knowledge and experience. The knowledge writers have about events and situations plays an important part in comprehension and production. The ability to comprehend unfamiliar information from reading and then to use it to write for a different purpose requires calling upon existing knowledge structures to accommodate and assimilate new information. Also, reading and writing interact and influence each other. A strategy that helps promote the creation and elaboration of ideas in writing, analogical reasoning, encourages writers to reason from the familiar to the unfamiliar. Given that most learning at the college level involves reasoning from reading for writing, students must learn how to write and reason with information  from their reading. (EI)",

The subjects--38 seventh graders who had a one to three year vocabulary deficit, according to the \"Iowa Test of Basic Skills\" pretest in vocabulary--were divided into two groups, Sample A (control) and Sample B (experimental). Sample A was given vocabulary instruction using the computer program, while Sample B was given the same lessons using the print-out from the computer. The computer corrected the control group and the students corrected the errors with the class in the experimental group. Results of the study showed no significant difference between the two methods of instruction. However, there was a slight difference in favor of  the experimental, teacher-directed group, showing that computer-assisted instruction is an educational tool but not a replacement for teachers.

All three groups received the same set of instructions for drafting and revising their essays and questions. Students' pretest and posttest writing samples were scored for development, organization, syntax, coherence, diction, attention to audience, and overall quality. Results indicated that attending to audience during revising was an effective strategy for improving some features of students' writing. (Author/HOD)",

Three tenth grade girls were interviewed about their family lives, interests, preferences for and experiences with reading, general expectations for fiction and exposition, and experiences with whole class and small group discussions. Individual responses were collected and tape recorded following the readings and following small group discussions. Analysis resulted in the following generalizations about the three readers' responses and expectations: (1) each girl had a preferred pattern of response common to both the short stories and textbook  selections; (2) purpose for reading informed all other general expectations for fiction and exposition; (3) establishment of text-specific expectations was central to responses to short stories, but not to textbook selections; (4) both text types were evaluated according to the match of a reader's general expectations and knowledge with text form and content; (5) all three girls benefited from the group discussions; and (6) each reader identified the strengths and weaknesses of the other girls' responses and examined her own responses in light of the others.

        "description":"Speech communication theorists have defined certain rhetorical characteristics that may improve the use and production of written texts. In order to determine whether social studies textbooks have rhetorical characteristics--containing both content information and the author's attitudes toward it--and whether these characteristics have the desired positive effects on students, two studies were conducted. A typology of metadiscourse was used to describe the types and amounts of informational and attitudinal discourse in nine social studies texts for students from third grade to college level and nine texts written by social scientists for adults, ranging from nonacademic to academic periodicals and monographs. Findings showed consistent differences in the use of informational and  attitudinal metadiscourse, with nontextbooks using more attitudinal metadiscourse and appearing more lively than textbooks. In the second study, with 120 sixth graders, a chapter from a social studies textbook was modified by adding informational and attitudinal metadiscourse and interpersonal voice as variables to determine their effects on retention and attitude. No overall significant main effects were found, although results indicated that metadiscourse was helpful for some subgroups of students, depending on whether interpersonal voice was used.

        "description":"In comparing 50 English as a second language (ESL) compositions written in class to 50 ESL compositions written at home, accuracy on the syntactic level and fluency on the discourse or rhetorical level for the home and class conditions were examined. The subjects, twenty-five undergraduate foreign students enrolled in special sections of freshman composition for international students at the University of Southern California (USC), were randomly drawn in a stratified random sample to represent the five largest foreign groups at USC. Each contributed four essays to the data base. Two were written in class and two were written at home. Syntactic accuracy was measured using a ratio of words per error. The measure used to evaluate discourse fluency was a holistic score designed to  measure adherence to organization and coherence only. While tests showed no statistical significance to the differences in class and home preformance, many of the subjects did show improved performance at home on an individual basis. The comparison between scores achieved for syntactic accuracy and discourse fluency shows no relationship between the two scores on individual compositions. The report concludes that time does not buy much for students in the improvement of either their syntax or their organization, and that the level of performance in these two areas is not interdependent.

        "description":"A case study examined purpose in the writing of four college freshmen enrolled in a basic composition course. Discourse based interviews were conducted with the subjects before and after they responded to each of three writing tasks designed to provide them with different choices for audience, mode, and focus. The data revealed two central ways in which students conceptualize the purposes for their writing. They are either class-directed in the development of purpose, or rhetorically flexible--able to accommodate their writing to different kinds of tasks with different topics and audiences. The results suggest that, in contrast to the predictions of current functional discourse taxonomies, these conceptualizations are more apt to grow out of the students' models of writing and  literacy than the specific features of the tasks to which they are responding. The results support a writing pedagogy in which a qualitative reformulation of students' discourse modes is more central to their continued learning than the quantitative acquisition or mastery of discourse-specific skills.

While theories of reader-response or deconstruction may seem to have had little effect on the practice of teaching literature, they do hold much in common with the way many teachers try to teach writing. The works of Roland Barthes and William Coles present theories on how to teach students to write effectively. Both men are preoccupied with the intertwining of language and the self, with the ways our sense of who we are is not only expressed by but also composed in our language. There are in the teaching of writing two common approaches to the question of style. One associates style with proper usage and trivializes it; the other equates style with  integrity and sanctimonizes it. Barthes and Coles offer us a view of style based on neither correctness nor sincerity but on complexity. They show us the dialectic of writing and the self. We are what our language makes of us, and what we can make of our language. (DF)",

On a separate sheet accompanying the first questionnaire, respondents were asked to indicate whether they would consider participating in the second stage of the research, a more open-ended and detailed questionnaire designed to more fully identify a spectrum of collaborative writing forms and strategies. This second survey was sent to 12 selected members of each of the six professional associations. The last stage of research involved on-site case studies with between four and six respondents who regularly write as part of a team or  group. This part of the research has not been completed. Results of the research thus far have revealed three problematic areas: (1) the concept of writing, especially authorship; (2) the lack of a vocabulary to describe what people do when they write; and (3) affective responses to group writing. These results confirm the hypotheses that collaborative writing is a well-established phenomenon among major professions, and that writing, rather than being a solitary act, is one that is essentially and naturally collaborative.

Public relations is a phenomenon within society and has existed long before the name was first applied to the work of building relationships between social groups. Public relations deals with the very core of human experience: relationships. If art may be understood as an interpretation of the human experience, then the public relations function is an art because it interprets the culture through the instrument of myth. The degree of success that the public relations practitioner enjoys or which the profession itself enjoys in its effort to interpret culture through myth becomes the basis for constructive criticism. Macro-myth is a process of social self-identification, which has seven stages or  characteristics, including an experience shared by a group of people, the institutionalization of the event, and a belief system that formalizes elements associated with the event into religious institutions. The myth experience thus affirms for the socially cohesive group a self-understanding, and because of this it is myth that offers the key to the critical evaluation of the public relations function.

These advertisements were studied for type, size, and content relating to categories of nonproduct or institutional advertising. The data revealed that Knoxville banks responded to the community banking crisis by increasing the number of ads during the 1982-83 crisis period but did not continue the increased activity in 1984. Moreover, product ads contained elements of nonproduct content, but the nonproduct ads did not increase markedly during any time period when compared with industry-wide standards. The ads appeared  to emphasize how well the banking industry could serve the people of Knoxville, and did not address economic troubles. Strength and growth potential did appear in the ads but not in conjunction with any banking problems the community may have been facing. The institutional ads contained traditional content, such as mergers, growth history, diversifications, and so forth. (HOD)",

        "description":"A study investigated the influence of television program type and scheduling characteristics on patterns of program choice. The problem to be explored was the relative contribution of program content to patterns of audience flow. Soap operas were scheduled on competing channels with the assumption that audience duplication between pairs of these programs should be higher than among pairs of similarly scheduled nonserials. Diary data collected from 1,629 randomly selected New York area heads of households in May 1981 provided the database from which a subset of all female heads of households were analyzed. Results strongly supported the hypothesis that predicted greater within-channel audience duplication among pairs of serials than among pairs of nonserials. The results failed to  support the hypotheses that predicted that between-channel duplication would be greatest for adjacent pairs of serials. In conclusion, the preference for types of program content plays a significant role in determining patterns of program choice. Indeed, the phenomenon of adjacent program audience duplication, or inheritance effects, appears to be facilitated by sequentially scheduling programs of a type. In addition, the study indicates the complications that actual patterns of program scheduling introduce to analyses of viewing behavior. (EL)",

        "description":"The fact that students have not learned to listen may be the reason some of them cannot write. Listening is an active process requiring the same skills of prediction, hypothesizing, checking, revising, and generalization that reading and writing demand. The following three exercises were designed to make students conscious of themselves as active listeners who create the voices they hear as they read/listen and write/listen. In the first exercise students were asked to retell the story of \"1984,\" and in the process learned some lessons about composing: (1) strategies of organization--beginnings, middles, ends--are not set by the form of the narrative itself, but developed by them as they retell the story; (2) general and specific ideas occur naturally as they both tell details of  the story and attempt to move to the next point by generalizing; and (3) retellings of the same plot can take many forms. The second lesson was begun by an oral reading of Dorothy Parker's \"You Were Perfectly Fine,\" and the students were to listen for details and generalities to use in retelling the story. In the third lesson the story of King Lear was told to the students, and they were asked to listen and retell it. Then they were asked to write a sentence or two that generalized what they felt about what the writer-voice seemed to tell them. The experiment taught students that listening is composing; what people listen for determines the form, style, and content of the responses they write. (EL)",

Problems relating to the construction of writing tasks, the allocation of writing tasks, and the scoring of student scripts were addressed. The most appropriate scoring system combined a holistic, overall-impression marking and an analytical marking.

        "description":"Using the &quot;pattern approach&quot; is a means of teaching students to be confident and competent writers. In this method, the writer uses a device called a planning blank to establish purpose, audience, topic, and role as a writer. Then the overall structure can be planned. A good writing plan should suggest not only a beginning, middle, and end, but also a form for the content of each of these parts of the work. The planning blank allows form and content to be planned on a single page, even for long works, without losing sight of audience and purpose. Instead of a traditional outline, a general pattern--such as a how-to pattern, a narrative pattern, or a problem-solution pattern--is selected first. Then a topic sentence outline is developed by supporting details. By using the pattern  method students can write such business and personal communications as letters, memos, reports, market projections, analyses, recommendations, proposals, and evaluations. The following can be noted about this approach: the pattern is less important than whether the form chosen accomplishes the purpose with the audience; patterns can be varied and combined to suit the writer's purposes; the length of the writing is irrelevant to pattern; no one has turned into a robot from using this approach; and the method can be used in all content areas with all levels of student and professional writers.

After suggesting that a report invented the story of the O'Leary cow kicking a lantern and starting the fire, the first portion of the paper describes the dry and fire-prone conditions of the city at the time, the O'Leary family, and the fire's destruction. The middle portion describes how the four Chicago newspapers, their offices destroyed, still managed to publish in the days immediately following the fire. This section also examines initial newspaper accounts of the fire, which did in fact begin in O'Leary's barn,  and traces the origins of the &quot;irate cow&quot; story. The next section explores accounts published in papers across the country, discussing why the stories were so sensational and inaccurate. These include a story stating that the fire was the result of a communist conspiracy. The last portion of the paper describes various witnesses and their testimony before the Board of Police and Fire Commissioners--most of them exonerating the O'Learys of blame for the fire--and then discusses the most likely causes of the fire, and the likelihood that the &quot;cow story&quot; had been a hoax intended to make the story more lively.

The profession agrees that literacy is the encoding and decoding of meaning, but there is little agreement on the term \"meaning.\" Sociolinguists define literacy as a cluster of linguistic, psychological, and social skills that rely on the conventions of the alphabet and of print, but also on purpose, difficulty, and interest. Other problems in defining the term are the differences and the relationships between the skills required for reading and those required for writing, and the question of permanence, or retention, of these skills. Literacy is distinct from mastery of the standard dialect, and it is not  schooling, cognition, or merely \"reading.\" Neither is it the same as culture. What seems to emerge from these distinctions, however, is a connection between literacy and culture. Among the cultural determinants of literacy are religion, economics, and politics. Only by searching the maze of relationships among humans and their cultures can the profession move toward a definition of literacy. (HTH)",

        "author":["Furner, Beatrice A."],
        "description":"Assuming that some handwriting will be necessary in the computer age, questions remain as to the instructional techniques that facilitate learning in handwriting, whether the cost and time required to teach two forms of writing can be justified, and which form is learned more easily and is better suited for use in a technological age. Effective instruction must be based on recognition that handwriting is a perceptual motor skill. Principles of instruction that are important to teaching handwriting are based on theories of perceptual learning, and research supports the use of perceptual learning techniques. Characteristics of computer assisted instruction (CAI) include individualization of the rate of learning, adjustment of difficulty, feedback, and reinforcement. Comparison of  the instructional techniques shown to be important in perceptual learning in handwriting with the capabilities of CAI suggests that computers have the potential to facilitate learning of handwriting. Although the development of CAI in handwriting is in the early stages, available research supports the conclusion that carefully designed computer-based programs of instruction can be of value for some, if not all, learners. It also appears that continued research in analysis of handwriting processes and products can lead to refinement in forms taught and materials used for writing by children and adults. (Recommendations for the development of handwriting programs involving CAI are included.) (HTH)",

        "description":"Because the quoting of anonymous sources in journalism has received a great deal of attention recently, a study was conducted to focus attention on the broadcast media by examining the quoting of anonymous sources on network television newscasts. Four research questions were formulated: (1) What percentage of television news stories contain anonymous attribution? (2) How frequently are unnamed sources quoted? (3) What types of stories contain the most anonymous attribution? and (4) How are unnamed sources described? In the fall of 1982, two weeks of network television newscasts were selected randomly and videotaped. The resultant 27 newscasts and coded stories were analyzed according to a number of variables, including subject matter, type, and presence of anonymous contribution.  About 55% of the 416 stories contained at least one quote that was attributed to an unnamed source. About 59% of the CBS stories, 57% of the NBC stories, and 47% of the ABC stories contained anonymous attribution. Subject matter of stories did not seem to affect the use of unnamed sources very much, and &quot;neutral&quot; anonymous sources were most often quoted. In light of these findings, network news organizations might consider restricting their granting of confidentiality to sources and letting viewers know more about how the information in news stories is confirmed.

        "description":"Journalism historians in recent years have made good use of agenda-setting theory in research, but there has been one drawback: in concentrating on the political and economic views of publishers, editors, and reporters, the agendas of those working behind the scenes, the public relations men and women have been overlooked. The public relations agenda was particularly important in the 1920s, when it was estimated that over half of all stories in the &quot;New York Times&quot; and other major newspapers originated in public relations offices. Ivy Lee, the &quot;father of modern public relations,&quot; had an agenda that can best be understood through an analysis of his economic and theological beliefs in an early twentieth-century context. Lee was one of the first public relations practitioners to  oppose competitive enterprise and espouse alliances of large corporations with each other and the federal government. He combined sophisticated economics with &quot;situational ethics&quot; developed through assimilation of popularized Darwinian theory and Freudian thought. Lee's beliefs concerning economics and theology allowed him to conceal his major objectives with almost total assurance that he was working for a greater good. This helps to explain why Lee had such great success in dealing with the press: He was seen as a proponent of the economics of the future, and his liberalism proved influential. (Author/DF)",

        "description":"This study examines the relationship between deviance and newsworthiness. A general explanation of deviance and definitions for five types of deviance--statistical, pathological, normative, labeling, and self-conception--are provided in the first sections of this paper. Next, the relationship between deviance and communication is explored, as are four approaches to communication: (1) content as function of media routines, (2) content as influenced by journalists' socialization and attitudes, (3) content as resulting from social and institutional forces, and (4) content as a function of ideological position. Major indicators of newsworthiness--such as novelty, conflict, sensationalism, and prominence--are also discussed, as well as other criteria, including timeliness, proximity,  importance, and interest. A theoretical explanation for the relationship between deviance and newsworthiness is then provided. The summary points out that half of what is newsworthy can be interpreted as being deviant and that to the extent that deviant people and events bring about the opportunity for change, publicizing deviance is a prerequisite for controlling the direction and extent of social change.

        "description":"A study was conducted to explore the process of learning from television news and the relationship between audio and visual channels. The subjects, 82 undergraduate journalism majors enrolled in five newswriting classes, were randomly assigned to experimental conditions. Newscasts were recorded from evening newscasts aired by networks, and scripts were written in typical broadcast style. Video was edited to the audio to produce the strongest possible match between two channels. In one condition (high redundancy) all stories had redundant audio and video. In the second newscast (medium redundancy) half of the stories were covered by video that did not match the audio. The third condition (low redundancy) had video that did not match the audio in any of the stories. Two other  conditions were created to provide baseline measures for single-channel recall. The audio from the high redundancy condition was played to one group and the video from the high redundancy condition was shown to another. Resulting data showed that close coordination between audio and video improved audio recall of television news stories and that redundancy aided story understanding and audio information recall.

Responses indicated that, overall, the communication-technician role, with a focus on writing and producing messages, stood out as quite distinct from other roles. However, the dominant role-orientation factor, called \"decision-making,\" combined elements from the roles of problem solving process facilitation, communication process facilitation, and expert prescriber. Some communication-technician-oriented educators  appeared to stress the physical production of messages, while others focused on writing, planning and media relations broadly defined. Overall, educators showed a strong felt need to train generalists for public relations careers.(HOD)",

Representing different news policies and structural constraints, 1,164 religion news items from the &quot;New York Times,&quot; Minneapolis &quot;Star,&quot; and the Richmond (Virginia) &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot; were content analyzed from June through August 1981. The results indicated consistent differences between the work of the two groups of journalists. As predicted, the specialists obtained most of their news information from religious sources, while the nonspecialists more often relied on secular sources. Although the two groups of journalists produced similar proportions of multiple-source stories, the religion specialists used those sources to provide several  religious perspectives on an issue or event. The nonspecialists more often focused on the secular viewpoint, giving just enough information from a single religious source to give a religious angle to the article. The religion specialists at all the newspapers produced stories emphasizing change and cooperation more often than did the nonspecialists. Religion writers at each of the newspapers reported primarily on conflict within the religious community while the nonspecialists provided most of the coverage of conflict between religion and society.

While no formal hypothesis was tested, it was thought that coverage would reflect the general news policy at each particular paper to the extent that the religious beat has lost its stigma as a second-class beat. Twenty-eight religious stories from the &quot;New York Times,&quot; 141 from the Minneapolis &quot;Star,&quot; and 165 from the Richmond &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot; appearing in issues from June through August 1981, were content-analyzed. When all the stories had been coded, a list of stories from each newspaper was prepared. From those lists, a random sample of 26 stories was selected and each was recoded. Each of the three newspapers followed a distinctive news style intended to attract and meet the needs of  its particular audience. The analysis of results indicated that religious news was not treated significantly different from other kinds of news during the study period, and that religious stories seemed to match their respective papers' general news format. The study found that there were similarities in the religion news coverage of these three papers, consistent with previous studies suggesting that religious stories are longer, broader in scope, and more issue-oriented than they once were. The data also suggest that both differences among papers and among previous research findings are more likely explained by the news philosophy of a particular paper and its structural constraints than by any preconceived assumptions about the nature of religious news.

The intent was to explain the marked changes that occurred between the periods and evaluate the newspaper's possible influence on the course of local events by considering the experience of the black community in Parsons before and after the 1890s. The analysis revealed that the early &quot;Blade's&quot; inside editorial and local news pages protested oppression and projected to blacks an image of themselves as participating members of society. But its  clippings endorsed the status quo of American society, which perceived individual blacks as threatening and ignored the existence of a black community. The 1897 &quot;Blade&quot; lacked a sufficiently developed national communications network that in a more systematic way could have offered evidence to show that the increasing black consciousness and the white reaction against it were not simply local phenomena.

Following an introduction citing studies on the educational uses of soap operas, the paper explores the following components of these serials: the audiences and their reasons for viewing soap operas, the basic plot structures, general demographics of characters, female characters, black characters, elderly characters, relationships between characters, and the use of time. The paper concludes with a 7 page bibliography of books and articles dealing with soap operas and education. (HTH)",

        "description":"A survey was conducted of 102 active quality circle members drawn from five organizations to determine how quality circle participation affected communication, as perceived by members themselves. The survey consisted of two parts. The first part contained ten open-ended questions inquiring about the respondent's personal experience in quality circles. The second part of the survey consisted of the communication portion of Likert's Profile of Organizational Characteristics. Follow-up interviews with 24 survey respondents provided secondary data. Analysis of the data revealed that quality circle participation had positive effects on perceived individual power/influence, communication with superiors, subordinates, and to some degree, with peers. Most respondents viewed their  organization as either consultative or benevolent authoritative. Among the areas of organizational communication not affected by quality circle participation were opportunities for advancement, belong/acceptance by others, and tangible rewards.

A course was designed to teach students to apply basic concepts in the field of organizational communication to &quot;real life&quot; communication problems in organizations. The objectives included increasing student knowledge of organizational operation; organizational communication; the identification, analysis, and solution of organizational communication problems; career preparation; and the development of practical research skills. The course used three teaching methods--lecture/discussion, case studies/role plays/group exercises, and the communication audit, and two types of evaluation: an informal assessment  based on student comments and a brief questionnaire administered to all students. The communication audit was found to contribute significantly more to student achievement by sending students into places of business and other organizational settings. Before using the audit for classroom use, instructors need to consider a number of issues, including the selection of organizations, grouping students, maintaining a working relationship with the organizations, research methods, and scheduling.

Chapter one discusses the drama philosophy, goals, and objectives, the continuum of child growth in drama, and teacher resource texts. Chapter two deals with physical, intellectual, emotional, and social characteristics of the child, along with implications for the  teacher and examples of how to use those characteristics in drama. Chapter three focuses on organizing the instruction and includes separate sections on the function of the teacher and the child in drama, followed by an explanation of the functions, program plans for teaching drama, and a suggested dramatic form sequence. Chapter four covers skills, concepts, and resources, and includes the following dramatic forms of expression: dramatic movement, mime, choral speech, storytelling, dramatization, puppetry, choric drama, readers' theatre, story theatre, playmaking, and group drama.

        "description":"A performance appraisal interview is a primary and important context for the supervisor and employee to work together to achieve superior performance. A survey of the research literature reveals that the appraisal interview functions to provide feedback on performance, to counsel and provide help, to discover what the employee is thinking, to teach the employee to problem solve, to help the employee discover ways to improve, to set performance goals, and to discuss compensation. In addition, the literature reveals three reasons that determine frequency of interview: the nature of the goal of the interview, the kind of position the employee has in the organization, and the characteristics of the employee's performance. Research on climate is centered on praise, criticism and the  superior-subordinate relationship, while that on employee involvement in the performance appraisal process is divided into preparation and actual participation in the interview, including goal setting. Future research in this area should investigate employee development, credibility and interviewer style, evaluation and climate, and rhetorical strategies of the interviewee. (HOD)",

Finally, the principle helps to define the relationship between the introductory public relations course and other courses, both within the speech communication curriculum and outside the discipline. Topics that might be covered with an emphasis on corporate advocacy include audience identification, public relations tasks, media availability, strategic options, and sound argumentation. Another public relations  function that should be included in such a course is issues management--the process by which the corporation can identify, evaluate, and respond to those social and practical issues which may have a significant impact upon it.

        "description":"Although the use of video playback of classroom assignments for students who are communication apprehensive, shy, or unassertive has received widespread adoption, a review of the literature suggests that its use is potentially harmful. Typically, those with high anxiety about communication are characterized by excessive fear of evaluation, irrational beliefs about being the focus of attention, low self-esteem, negative expectations of success, inability to accept success evaluation, tendency to negatively interpret their own actions, and unwillingness/inability to self-disclose. Video feedback focuses attention on self and magnifies communication performance difficulties and so might increase fear of communication, reinforce negative self-perceptions, and further reduce  self-esteem and expectations of success in communication. Stress reactions to video feedback have been found in a few studies. Research has also shown some practices of video feedback to be successful, such as the use of self-modeling, using video models of others, preparing the students for videotaping, focusing feedback, and using several videotaped exercises to reduce novelty effects.

The findings of these commissions vary since each commission has its own concept of education, its own political purposes, and its own sources of data. Still, their general recommendations stress similar themes common to periods of conservatism. The reports can help identify weaknesses and focus public concern, but fail to offer practical information on change implementation. The reports also tend to disregard research on educational change, in some cases promulgating inappropriate recommendations and in others leaving state and local agencies without appropriate guidelines. The recommendations provided fall into three  categories: ideas known to be good but difficult to implement, ideas that are practical but prohibitively expensive, and appealing but empty statements. The reports have led to substantial activity by state legislatures, the impact of which may prove insignificant or even negative. Automatic acceptance of the recommendations may lead to implementation of unsuitable policies, disregard for negative consequences, creation of the illusion of change, the derailing of existing improvement efforts, the loss of gains made in other educational areas, and the inappropriate channeling of scarce energy and resources.

This paper focuses on three concerns that educators must face when fitting general recommendations to specific school settings. First, the improvement to be sought must be defined. Educators should focus energy and commitment on one or two efforts to maximize impact, selecting those most pertinent to the school, most likely to be supported, and least likely to detract from other efforts already underway. Second, activities in support of the change process must be designed and conducted. Since change is a complex process involving initiation,  implementation, and institutionalization of the new program or idea, and requires alterations in the behaviors of individuals and groups as well as in the materials they use, each step must be planned thoroughly. Third, the roles of the many participants in the change process must be specified. These participants include state and local policy makers and administrators, local facilitators, and building administrators. Relevant innovation implementation research is cited throughout the document. (PGD)",

The shorter, 5-year strategy targets conventional schools and is intended to help raise student achievement and professional competence. The process focuses on the implementation of proven practices--typically classroom level instructional practices offered through nationwide dissemination networks. The strategy depends on active professional interest and sustained efforts at identifying viable practices. Researchers can help practitioners understand and publicize their results while adding to the general pool of innovation information. Funding for the process should be made a  national and state priority. The longer-term strategy is aimed at innovators who must develop drastically new forms of schooling. The first step in the process is to define the characteristics of the desired educational product. Second, practical strategies for achieving these ends, incorporating reevaluated roles for professional and nonprofessional participants, must be developed. These strategies can be tested in settings in which traditional educational regulations (including certification) would be revised. These experiments would eventually provide procedures suitable for dissemination using the short-term strategy discussed earlier. (PGD)",

The first section gives a brief overview of education in Sweden at the end of the 1970's. The second section is concerned with the last three decades of development of Sweden's educational system, including discussions of the development of the school system as one part of the development of Swedish society, comprehensive school and upper secondary school, the accessibility of schools, student choice of a specialization, and equality between the sexes and freedom of choice. In addition, the following topics are covered: the schools and society; differentiation--a difficult issue; who makes decisions on the schools?; education for adults;  universities and professional colleges during the 1950's and 1960's; higher education for new categories of students; and the location and structure of higher education. The third section considers the emerging pattern in Sweden of alternating periods of education and work. The strategy and instruments of educational reform, with focus on educational policymakers and administrative agencies, are examined in the fourth section. (DCS)",

        "description":"South Carolina's comprehensive Education Improvement Act of 1984 includes provisions for the development and implementation of statewide incentive pay programs for teachers, principals, and schools. The provision affecting teachers mandates the development and field testing of up to three programs between 1984 and 1986 and the implementation of the final, selected program during the 1986-87 school year. Teachers will participate in developing the incentive program, which will be evaluated by a team of principals and teachers. The incentive pay program for principals will be produced through a similar development process, but on a timetable calling for final implementation during the 1987-88 school year. The incentive program for schools will make incentive grants available  through the state department of education to reward schools and districts for exceptional performance in improving student achievement, attendance, and attitudes; teacher attendance; parent participation; and other factors promoting or maintaining high levels of achievement. The funds are to be used for further improvement efforts. The incentive pay programs are expected to increase accountability in the areas of certification, evaluation, instruction, promotion, and expenditure. The support of South Carolina's governor, Richard Riley, is cited as a major factor in obtaining funding from the legislature. (PGD)",

        "description":"The educational reform movement has helped bring the principalship into new prominence. Among the forces affecting current attitudes toward the principalship are the effective schools literature, which has stressed the centrality of the principal's role; the anticipation of retirement by a large proportion of principals; the increased research on the principalship; analysis by principals of their own roles and responsibilities; the development of incentive pay programs for principals; and shifts in school governance toward state centralization and local district decentralization simultaneously. In response to these forces, local school boards and major national commissions are redefining the principal's role, and state legislation and federal policies are focusing on the  principal's leadership functions. Principals can participate actively in the changes that are occurring by becoming experts in personnel evaluation, thinking in terms of results rather than activities, increasing cooperation between their schools and the community, developing new loyalty to public education, and improving their control of time, their priorities, and their goals.

Effective functioning in the present requires a common body of knowledge, including mathematics, language skills, and geography, along with generalized skills for making adjustments in the body of knowledge (thinking skills, communication skills, and good personal habits). Adaptability is necessary because of the rapid pace of change; accordingly, emphasis on highly specific job-related skills is likely to be a disservice to students. The \"bottom line\" for schools is not to produce employability, but rather, to enable graduates to  achieve improvement in the quality of their lives. (TE)",

        "description":"This report on a preventive law institute held in Texas in 1981 includes an introduction, three papers, a summary of discussions, and a concluding statement. In the introduction Christiane Hyde Citron defines preventive law as decision making that takes constitutional and case law into consideration and that includes four basic steps: (1) anticipation of legal challenges; (2) evaluation of legal merits of challenges; (3) consideration of policy issues raised by potential challenges; and (4) modification in response to the first three steps. In &quot;State Regulation of Textbook Selection and Private Schools,&quot; Mark Yudof cautions that educational law is crisis oriented, constitutional law is fuzzy, and the public sector lacks market constraints. As a result, more constitutional  challenges to school library and textbook decisions have occured during the past 10 years than in the previous 100 years. Outlined are the basic regulations for textbook selection; court decisions are cited, and recommendations are made for established, fair procedures to avoid court litigation. State education agencies must apply evenness of control and equal application of rules toward public and private schools. &quot;Advocates Perspective on PL 94-142&quot;, by Jim Todd, presents the perspective of the suer in handicapped student litigation. This is usually a publicly funded advocacy agency which has an interest in resolving conflicts without litigation. A list of suggestions to prevent handicapped student litigation is provided. James Deatherage, in &quot;School Districts Perspective on PL 94-142,&quot;  outlines the legal framework governing the education of the handicapped; the sources and causes of conflicts; preventive actions; and alternative approaches for preventing litigation. &quot;Group Interaction and Consensus Building&quot; summarizes the major topics of discussion during the institute. In the concluding statement the practice of preventive law is presented as an important tool with which educators can control their futures. (MD)",

        "description":"This paper summarizes barriers that work to keep women in traditional positions within the work world and at the lower levels of organizational hierarchies within educational administration. Three general categories of barriers are outlined. In personal barriers, the first category, personality characteristics, background influences, and socialization patterns function to inhibit women's progress in educational administration. The second category, interpersonal barriers, characterizes the interactions between aspiring women and the dominant power groups (which tend to be white and male). The major types of interpersonal barriers are sex role stereotyping and intergroup polarization. These barriers function to perpetuate myths and biases about women's abilities and group women  together in such a way that all women suffer from the failures of a few. Organizational/structural barriers (the third category) occur in many aspects of an agency's functions: recruitment, selection, placement, evaluation, giving rewards, use of power and authority, and other norms and expectations. If educational and occupational equity are to be achieved, it is imperative that barriers be removed. Some strategies for combating these barriers are consciousness raising, career planning, management training, information sharing, mentoring, networking, and retraining. A list of further readings on the subject is provided. (MD)",

Tools for controlling and monitoring routine maintenance activities are in common use. These include defect and fluid consumption reports, work order systems, historical maintenance records, and performance and cost summaries. While these tools are necessary, they are not sufficient for effective maintenance management. Current management methods should be supplemented by strategic planning tools to improve maintenance performance and to control costs. The techniques having the greatest potential for improving cost effectiveness are work methods analysis and standard job time and cost analysis. Failure history analysis and workload and budget forecasting  procedures are also expected to improve strategic planning capabilities. These methods logically lead to the development of maintenance policy testing applications. Most of the data required to implement these methods are captured in current reporting processes, but special attention to maintaining accurate and accessible historical records is essential for use of these methods. This report is divided into the following sections: introduction, background, current methods, new techniques, summary and conclusions, references, and appendixes. Thirty-seven exhibits and 25 references are provided. The three appendices offer references to related reports and papers, examples of shop and garage reports, and several vehicle replacement decision making models. (Author/DCS)",

Responses indicate that the process of assuming supervisory responsibility was not yet complete, though more complete in senior high schools than in junior high or middle schools. Likewise, indicators of the beneficial effects of this program on building maintenance and cleanliness were reported more often at the senior high than at the junior high or middle school levels. Benefits of the change reported by the principals included greater ease in ordering custodial supplies, greater authority over the custodial function, and a  closer working relationship with the building engineer. The major disadvantage of the program was seen to be the amount of administrative time it requires. Suggestions were offered for followup conferences and additional staff development sessions.

Part 1, &quot;An Attempt to Restructure Elementary Schooling,&quot; consists of three chapters describing IGE. Chapter 1 delineates the assumptions of IGE in the context of school reform efforts of the past quarter century. Chapter 2 outlines the intentions, components, and implementation strategies of the IGE program, while chapter 3 describes the plan for evaluating IGE. In part 2, &quot;The Effects of Planned Change,&quot; five chapters summarize the evidence gathered in the IGE evaluation project. Chapter 4 summarizes the data concerning whether  IGE &quot;really happened&quot; in schools, while chapters 5 to 8 summarize the findings from each of the four phases of the project: a large sample causal study, on-site validation of IGE implementation, a field study of six IGE schools, and five curriculum studies. Part 3 concludes the book with a single chapter (chapter 9) discussing the implications of IGE and its evaluation. A list of presentations and publications associated with the project is included.

        "description":"This report describes a project which targeted two-person teams of leadership-level personnel in special education and speech/language pathology for training in child language to serve severely handicapped non-verbal children. A \"pyramid\" training model was used and these primary trainees conducted additional training with teachers and clinicians in their home districts/agencies upon completion of their own training. Five primary workshops, each including five to seven interdisciplinary teams of leadership-level, inservice professionals were conducted over a period of about 2 years. Training consisted of 6 days of intensive workshop activity which involved reading, group discussion, and viewing of eight instructional videotape programs. The content areas covered included: (1) an  overview of the nature of human communication and language; (2) cognitive bases of early communication and language; (3) social bases of early communication and language; (4) early stages and processes in the development of receptive, expressive and discourse linguistic skills; (5) nature and role of caregiver-child interaction in early communication and language development; (6) specific taxonomies or units of analysis to describe child performances; (7) principles of communication assessment and treatment for nonverbal students/clients; and (8) principles of communication assessment and treatment for language using, but severely language-deficient students/clients. Project staff also followed up with each team of primary trainees to obtain feedback on the applications that were made of  this material in each trainee's home agency; and to assist trainees in planning, implementing and evaluating training activities they conducted in their home agencies. The evaluation of this project focused on both effectiveness and cost benefits. In terms of long-term impact, these trainees provided training to an additional 826 inservice professionals and impacted on a total of 12,853 severely handicapped children. (Author/CL)",

In study 1, 114 LD students received a randomly assigned treatment combination twice a week for 6 weeks. Four individual treatment components included electromyographic biofeedback monitoring, handwriting practice, prerecorded relaxation tapes, and homework. Results of pre- and post-test scores on a battery of tests revealed that biofeedback training and listening to relaxation tapes, especially in combination, appeared to enhance general attention level and verbal facility. In a second study, it was found that teachers can deliver a relaxation program within the school and obtain significant improvement in the basic academic skills of their learning disabled  students. A final study field-tested a self-contained instructional training package for use by teachers of learning disabled students. The studies suggested that trained clinicians were able to bring about greater gains in academic performance than were teachers who had little clinical training, especially with the complex biofeedback instruments.

To identify factors related to parents' involvement in specific types of parent programs and activities, the Parent Needs Assessment Inventory (PNAI) was developed. The PNAI consisted of four instruments measuring family background data, feelings about having a handicapped child, involvement in the community, and educational program ratings. A recording system was also devised to determine level of parent involvement in parent activities and programs. Using data from the PNAI, profiles of parents were established for those likely to be or not likely to be involved in the following specific  program options: parent counseling, parent-provided programs, parent education, and direct participation programs. Field test data on the PNAI are reported for 208 families, as are profile analyses. Findings suggested that family involvment is related more to program design than to noneducational family background variables. Extensive appendixes, which include documentation of project activities, correspondence, and assessment tools, comprise more than half of the document. (CL)",

        "description":"Evaluation of eligibility for extended school year (ESY) services was made based on informaton contained in school files in a stratified sampling across Pennsylvania. Subjects had been classified as severely and profoundly mentally retarded and were divided into groups based on eligibility for programming in excess of 180 days or ineligibility for these services. The variables related to the eligibility criteria set forth in &quot;Battle v. Commonwealth&quot; including the nature and severity of the handicaps, self-sufficiency, and skill regression. Also, several administrative variables were examined. The analysis revealed that the ESY group had received more diagnoses of health impairments and had had more school initiated contacts with parents. The ESY group also had more objectives  that were incomplete and of indeterminable self-sufficiency. Results are reviewed for recommendations for future research and practice. Appendixes contain correspondence and data collection sheets. (Author/CL)",

        "description":"This investigation examined whether advance organizers would help learning disabled (LD) adolescents to more efficiently process information on selected academic tasks. There were three phases: First, 51 LD and 63 normally achieving (NA) subjects participated in the development of a test to measure important and unimportant information. Second, eight LD adolescents, one NA adolescent, and 10 secondary content teachers participated in a study to investigate the use of advance organizers in an applied setting. Using two multiple-baseline designs across teachers and students, teachers were trained to use advance organizers, and students were trained to listen for advance organizers. This phase generated information regarding how organizers might be used and constructed in a natural  setting. The third phase involved examining the effects of advance organizers under more controlled conditions with 46 LD and 51 NA adolescents. The test developed in the first phase of research was used to measure how adolescents performed on measures of important and unimportant information under treatment and control conditions. Results of the study conducted in the applied setting demonstrated the efficacy of using advance organizers in secondary classrooms. All teachers learned to use the advance organizers in their classrooms with minimal training, and all students showed increases in their awareness to teacher use of advance organizers after training. In the final investigation, the advance organizer treatment significantly increased test scores of the LD group, but not for the NA  group. A significant interaction was demonstrated for the LD group on the type of information learned. LD students in the treatment group identified more important information than the control group, while LD students in the control group identified more unimportant information than the LD students in the treatment group. In addition, LD students performed significantly poorer than NA students on measures of both important and unimportant information. However, this distance was minimized when the advance organizer treatment was present. Results of these investigations support the postulation that advance organizers can exert a positive influence on the learning of LD adolescents. (Author/CL)",

Hierarchical cluster analysis techniques resulted in a six-cluster solution which demonstrated good internal validity. Each of the six subtypes displayed a deficit in speed of recoding but differed from each other on sustained attention, phonetic and semantic encoding, short term memory capacity, and long term memory organization. The subtypes were marginally differentiated by the five reading subtests of the \"Woodcock Reading Mastery Test.\" These results indicated support for the heterogeneity of strengths and weaknesses in  cognitive processing for this group of learning disabled readers but suggested caution regarding the role of specific processes in reading failure.

Factor analysis for older and younger Ss revealed four main findings: (1) the factor structure for the total deaf group differed from the hearing group; (2) differences in cognitive structure was evident by age level for the deaf; (3) differences existed between cognitive structures of hearing and deaf Ss of the same age; and (4) a similar abstract thinking component existed for hearing and older deaf Ss.

All-day compliance programs resulted in findings that were difficult to interpret. Repeated mandates used to improve the compliance of severely handicapped students appeared to be a promising approach.

        "description":"The proposed theoretical framework emphasizes the interaction between sociocultural, linguistic, and school program factors in explaining the academic and cognitive development of bilingual children. It is theorized that bilingualism that is cognitively and academically beneficial can be achieved only on the basis of adequately developed first language (L1) skills. This position is based on two hypotheses. The \"developmental interdependence\" hypothesis proposes that the development of competence in a second language (L2) is partially a function of the type of competence already developed in L1 at the time when intensive exposure to L2 begins. The \"threshold\" hypothesis proposes that there may be threshold levels of linguistic competence that bilingual children must attain both in  order to avoid cognitive disadvantages and to allow the potentially beneficial aspects of bilingualism to influence their cognitive and academic functioning. This model of bilingual education explains educational outcomes as a function of the interaction between background, child input, and educational treatment factors. Attention is also directed to problems with bilingual education program evaluations that fail to consider these potential interactions. A review of relevant literature and studies is included.

        "description":"Issues concerning bilingual education are discussed, with a focus on the effect of social class on educational outcomes. While bilingualism tends to be associated with some educational advantages for the upper class, it often appears to result in an additional handicap within the lower ranges. In many educational outcomes affecting bilinguals, social class rather than bilingualism per se may be the factor of primary importance. Two hypotheses concerning the reason for educational underachievement of the poor are identified: the deficit and the difference hypotheses. During the war on poverty, a frequent debate concerned the hypothesis that educational failure of the poor was related to a mismatch of their native language and the language of school (i.e., the poor speak a  different dialect or language distinct from middle class English). This linguistic mismatch hypothesis was applied in public schools through the Bilingual Education Act. Also considered are the effects in the schools of the Lau decision (1974) and an Office of Civil Rights' decision. Three possibly valid explanations of different effects of upper class and lower class bilingualism are also proposed. The effects of immersion of lower and middle/upper class children for the purposes of second language teaching is discussed in some depth. Additional topics include the effects of motivation, limited English speaking children, the threshold level and additive vs. subtractive bilingualism hypotheses, and local flexibility concerning bilingual education policy.

General points and things to avoid in material selection for cloze are outlined for grades kindergarten  through 6, high school grades, and adult classes. For the analysis of classroom cloze reliabilities, a chart indicates for each grade and section the number of items, the language, the administration mode, the number of subjects, the score type, and the reliability coefficients. Correlations of the cloze procedure with results of other achievement tests are also provided.

Attention is briefly directed to methodological problems of experiments, such as controlling classroom events in various ways, and to conceptual weaknesses with study variables. In contrast, classroom-centered research, which involves observation, assumes that the description of classroom activities is a prerequisite to research on second language learning effectiveness and that formal instruction's contribution to language acquisition cannot be studied without measuring actual classroom activity. To illustrate the approaches employed by the experimental study and classroom-centered research, a hypothetical study about teacher correction of  learners' errors is considered. Three vital roles played by nonexperimental investigations of the second language classroom are identified: (1) identifying variables whose importance for classroom learning should be investigated experimentally, (2) discerning the unique character of the second language classroom, and (3) developing new conceptualizations of the second language classroom. The view of the classroom largely guiding second language classroom research is that of an interaction between teachers and learners. Alternative views of the classroom have also arisen based on observation and analysis of the second language classroom. (SW)",

The children were enrolled in the Individualized Bilingual Instruction (IBI) program for at least one year from preschool through grade 3. About 30-50 children were tested at each grade level, and a like number were tested in a neighboring school for a comparison group. IBI children and the comparison group of Spanish-speaking, migrant farm worker children did not differ significantly on pretests. For the followup study, about 10 IBI children and about 15 comparison group children were tested at each grade level, grades 4-6. At this time, IBI children had been out of the IBI program from 1-5 years. IBI  children had special instruction one hour a day. During the winter months, they were taught in the home base area, while special instruction was continued in temporary locations in the north during the migrant work season. The instructional materials were structured and sequenced, and the lessons were individualized. Frequent mastery checks were also provided. For the followup study, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test and the math and reading subtests of the Wide Range Achievement Test were administered to students. FIndings include: (1) IBI children learned English much faster than children in the comparison group; (2) IBI children maintained and improved their Spanish; (3) IBI children achieved much higher scores in reading and arithmetic than comparison children; and (4) the IBI  children's superiority was maintained at upper grade levels after they left the program.

Included is a review of the state of the art in bilingual education that covers demographic projections, historical deficiencies in the definition of language minority students, and the progression of research trends and perceived needs. In addition, attention is focused on communicative competence and second language acquisition theories, as well as the framework for bilingual education.

        "description":"The kinds of testing of listening skills that could be introduced for Foreign Languages in Elementary Schools (FLES) in the early stages of instruction (e.g., in the third grade at the end of 10-20 clock hours of instruction) are discussed. It is suggested that listening is rarely tested in isolation, but normally is mixed with speaking or writing. At least three types of test item responses exist for listening: action response, evaluation response, and communication response. All are intended to create a response that can be used to evaluate listening (comprehension) skill without resorting to the other language skills or with only minimal use of simple utterances that make little or no demand on the speaking skill. In an action response one hears a command and physically  carries out the command. The complexity of the teacher's utterance and the degree of familiarity of the utterance could become factors in the determination of scores. An evaluation response calls for the learners to give some indication of whether an utterance accurately portrays reality, or which of a set of possible responses is the correct one. Action response and evaluation response items call for little or no use of speaking, while communication response calls for oral response. The students' utterance involves not only their perception of the teacher's message, but also its intent and the formulation of an appropriate response with well-chosen linguistic structures. (SW)",

        "author":["McLaughlin, Daniel"],
        "description":"Literacy of Navajo Indians within an isolated community of a northeast Arizona Navajo reservation is discussed, based on an ethnographic investigation. Functions for English and Navajo literacy in two community settings where Navajos use standard and vernacular print are described. Using literacy artifacts, participant observation, and interview data collected over six months, attention is also directed to ways of participating in situations where people construct meaning from print; beliefs individuals share about literacy; and roles that institutions and power play in the overall functioning of literacy. Navajos exemplify a traditionally oral people who are both undergoing rapid modernization and, in certain church, school, and home domains, developing uses for vernacular  print. Most Navajos, however, do not read and write nearly as effectively as school, business, and government institutions demand. Findings thus far indicate that an oral-literate diglossia exists whereby Navajos typically communicate in Navajo but read and write in English. Interaction within the chapterhouse and the church are discussed and illustrated using chapter notes, field notes, interview transcripts, and excerpts of a communion service. Cochran-Smith's (1984) idea about multiple layers of context is used as a framework for the analysis. The Navajo community's literacy events can be viewed as circles around a center, involving the physical and behavioral structure; functions for speaking, reading, and writing; a level of beliefs; and a level structured by power.

Data were obtained from 679 Australian and 98 U.S. department heads, using similar instruments developed by the Nebraska-Lincoln Task Force on Management Practices in Higher Education. The university differed from the CAEs and state colleges in emphasizing graduate education, offering more majors, and enrolling more students. Respondents indicated whether 61 tasks were part of their responsibilities and whether they needed professional development on the tasks. The tasks can be categorized as: budget planning, development and control, student relations, human relations and personnel  administration, internal/external relations, internal administration, personal/professional development, and curriculum and instruction. Findings include: Australian chairs engaged in fewer tasks than the U.S. chairs; university chairs engaged in fewer tasks than state college chairs; and Australian chairs did not engage in the budget planning, development and control, and student relations tasks.

        "description":"The challenge posed by a decline in minority enrollment and a new push to raise college admission standards is discussed. State governing board members must consider whether to institute more stringent and systemwide admissions policies and must weigh the effect of such policies on prospective minority enrollment. Policymakers need to protect the basic principles of fairness and opportunity in higher education. To assist policymakers with decisions on systemwide admissions policies, the Educational Testing Service initiated a study by Hunter M. Breland on the impact of the following five admissions models on minority enrollments: single index model, multiple index model, either-or model, sliding scale model, and predicted performance model. Another study, conducted by Richard  Duran, which used data on Hispanic performance on admissions tests, raises important issues for state boards of higher education. An example of the difficulty of shaping a fair standard across colleges is the recent controversy over the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Proposition 48, which stipulates academic standards for freshmen athletes. The College Board has developed guidelines for systems or groups of colleges that use College Board tests for admission purposes. (SW)",

        "description":"Educational financing patterns of full-time undergraduates in New York State were compared for Asians, Blacks, Hispanics, and Whites. Compared to Whites, the minority students had lower incomes, were more likely to be financially independent of their parents, and were more likely to attend the City University of New York (CUNY) or proprietary schools. Minorities more often than Whites exhibited need gaps in excess of $100 between total educational costs and the sum of family contributions plus financial aid. Minorities were likely to receive more need-based grant dollars than were Whites, who were more likely to utilize Guaranteed Student Loans. However, the average total amounts of financial aid awarded for both grants and loans did not differ dramatically by ethnicity. Minority  respondents were more likely to consider financial aid necessary to attending college. Special Opportunity Programs for economically/academically disadvantaged students were significant to minority access to college. Findings are shown for the State University of New York, CUNY, the independent non-profits, and proprietary sector. A seven-page bibliography of related reading is provided.

In examining the function of paradox in adaptation and renewal, it was found that individuals who can simultaneously focus on opposites, or paradoxes, are tolerant and flexible. Differences in cognitive styles lead to differences in leadership and decision-making styles. Four types of institutional forms exist: hierarchy, market, clan and &quot;adhocracy&quot; (i.e., dynamic systems with maximum innovation). These institutional forms vary on the dimensions of flexibility/control and internal/external emphasis. Each of the four organizational types exists in American higher education. Certain activities are effective at institutions  where leaders and information processing styles are congruent with the organizational forms (e.g., clans are led by father/mother figures and strategies are centered on cohesion and human resource development). Institutions that tended to improve their effectiveness from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s possessed paradoxical characteristics: they were likely to be both clans and markets. In addition, schools faced with problems such as declining enrollment and revenues adapted successfully when simultaneously opposite strategies were implemented. (SW)",

        "description":"In recent years, clinical and developmental psychologists have been practicing in health care settings, including public health programs and hospitals. Psychologists have struggled to develop an identity in the health care setting and a medical-psychological theory for practicing as a consultant with medical patients. Because consultation/liaison practice requires practitioners to leave their offices and come into hospital wards and because of uncertain payment for this kind of practice, the participation and status of psychiatrists in this role is uncertain. In addition to preventing and treating psychological symptoms, the liaison psychologist or psychiatrist provides continuing education programs to help medical and nursing personnel handle patients' psychological needs.  Psychiatrists and hospital administrators have developed a delivery system staffed by social service employees at a less expensive rate than paid to psychiatrists. Recent legislation in several areas allows hospital privileges for psychologists, who enter the hospital as autonomous and competent agents, rather than being employees under the supervision of psychiatrists or other physicians. A training model for psychologists that embraces the autonomous practitioner in the health care setting is needed. (SW)",

        "description":"A variety of special financial aid practices that colleges have created to meet the needs of adult students are described, based on a 1983 survey of financial aid directors from more than 100 colleges. Information is provided on campus-based sources of financial aid such as: credit for prior learning programs, financial and career information services, loans, modified tuition plans and related support services, scholarships, and student employment. Also covered are community-based resources, including banks and lending institutions; business, industry, and unions; military, and voluntary, civic, and not-for-profit agencies. Profiles are presented for 70 financial aid practices/programs. Each profile covers the details of the practice, how it originated, its eligibility  requirements, the number of participants, and the college office that coordinates the practice. The profiles are divided into two sections: practices utilizing campus-based sources of financial aid, and those using community-based sources of financial aid. It is noted that the most widely available community-based aid source for adult students is business and industry, which often has tuition aid plans for employees. Company-sponsored instruction is also a widespread practice. (SW)",

The first study determined that many systematic errors in programming were due to programmers' high-level misconceptions of the nature of the computer and of the syntax and semantics of the programming language. The second study found that many misconceptions could be remediated effectively through a combination of (1) explicit training about the syntax and semantics of specific constructions in the programming language, (2) requiring learners to predict outcomes of short programs, and (3) providing students with interactive computer feedback. The third study examined methods used by high school  teachers in computer programming instruction, and the fourth considered students' use of their existing knowledge. Findings indicate that, when Pascal programming functions are embedded with other functions, the embedded functions are evaluated incorrectly by novice programmers more often than when they are evaluated in their unembedded form. Results suggest a lack of a standard curriculum at the high school level and weaknesses in high school courses and textbooks in their treatment of debugging. Four references are listed. (LMM)",

Production work groups of one to eight students planned their productions and wrote the accompanying scripts. Achievement for both the experimental and the control groups was measured by the Metropolitan Achievement Test (1978 edition). The experimental group showed a significant increase in both reading and language arts achievement test scores; however, only the medium  reading achievement experimental group showed a statistically significant increase in reading scores. The added time required for the media projects did not require the elimination of existing objectives. The use of media projects increased student interest and motivation as observed by the teachers involved, and reluctant learners became involved in language activities, especially reading, writing, and speaking. It was concluded that students gained valuable technical knowledge about media and greater understanding of the communications process. Five references are listed. (LMM)",

Teams of data-collectors went to nine different parts of Nepal and conducted interviews with more than 400 adult villagers from the following groups: Thakuri, Brahmin, Chhetri, Muslim, Bhote, Magar, Gurung, Maithili, Limbu, Rai, and Tharu. None of the villagers interviewed had ever been to school. The researchers showed the villagers a variety of pictures and colors and noted their responses. The main findings of the  study, and what they mean for National Development Service participants and other village development workers, are summarized in this booklet, which is also available in the Nepali language. Among the findings: villagers tend to &quot;read&quot; pictures very literally and do not expect to receive ideas from them; villagers do not necessarily look at a series of pictures from left to right, or assume that there is any connection between the pictures in a series; pictures that try to convey ideas or instructions often use symbols which are not understood by villagers; villagers are interested and attracted by pictures, even though they may need help to interpret them; realistic pictures, with a minimum of background detail, are the easiest for them to understand; and pictures showing a lot of  different objects are not well understood.

Distinctions are made between learning about computers, learning with computers, using computers as educational tools, and using computers with specific student populations. The results of three surveys of  computer use in elementary and secondary schools are cited. Section three notes the response of faculties of education to the challenge of preparing practicing teachers and student teachers in the intricacies of applying computer technology in their classrooms.

The first two papers address the question of what is required for a student to become a reasonably proficient programmer. The first--\"Mapping the Cognitive Demands of Learning to Program\" (D. Midian Kurland, Katherine Clement, Ronald Mawby, and Roy D. Pea)--reports a study of high school programming novices who participated in an intensive summer programming course. The second paper--\"The Development of Programming Expertise in Adults and Children\" (D. Midian Kurland, Ronald Mawby, and Nancy Cahir)--examines how expert  programmers acquired their skill, with attention to the amount of time invested and the type of resources available when they were learning to program. The last three papers look beyond programming to the issue of transfer. The third--\"Issues and Problems in Studying Transfer Effects of Programming\" (Kate Ehrlich, Valerie Abbott, William Salter, and Elliot Soloway)--examines whether learning to program helps students solve problems in other related intellectual domains. The fourth--\"What Will It Take to Learn Thinking Skills Through Computer Programming?\" (Roy D. Pea)--discusses research on the transfer of high level thinking skills from programming. The final paper--\"Making Programming Instruction Cognitively Demanding: An Intervention Study\" (John Dalby, Francoise Tourniaire, and Marcia  C. Linn)--describes a study in which a curriculum was designed explicitly to make programming more cognitively challenging. A concluding commentary by Jan Hawkins discusses the issues raised in the papers and offers thoughts on current and future directions for research in this field. (THC)",

Current approaches to the use of computers as devices for problem solving, reasoning, and thinking--i.e., expert systems and intelligent tutoring systems--are reviewed. Some characterizations of cognitive development as the construction of an invariantly ordered sequence of universal stages are followed by a review of recent challenges to these universal descriptions. Major challenges to developmental psychology posed by the coupling of human and computer intelligence are discussed. These challenges, which range from conservative to radical in their implications, include the use of computers as tools  to help children with proximal development, microworld pedagogic systems, pedagogic cognitive trace systems, pragmatic cognitive tools for higher level achievements, and systems for the coevolution of human-computer intelligence.

        "description":"This report describes an interactive video system developed by Active Learning Systems which utilizes a cable television (TV) network as its delivery system to transmit computer literacy lessons to high school and college students. The system consists of an IBM PC, Pioneer LDV 4000 videodisc player, and Whitney Supercircuit set up at the head end of a cable TV network. Accessed via modem by a computer located in a school using a customized version of the communications package, CONNECT, the system makes it possible for interactive video designed to run on an IBM PC to be delivered on an Apple, Commodore, TRS 80, a dumb terminal, or any other computer that uses a TV as a monitor and uses a phone modem. The report includes a review of the system's technology; an outline of its  benefits; and discussions of system difficulties and how they were addressed. Such difficulties included expense, crashes, response time, conflicting programs, readability, clarity, graphics, hardware, phone connections, switchboards, and distance. A final test in which lessons were delivered via microwave transmission from the head end of a cable network to a high school about 20 miles away is noted. Future implications of the system for education, entertainment, and marketing are discussed, and lists of personnel and companies involved in the research and distributors of interactive video computer literacy products are provided.

The account is organized chronologically, first describing the pilot period when microcomputers were placed in the classrooms and LOGO became part of classroom activities for 2 months before the school year's end; then the experiment's first year, including a recounting of the teacher's expectations, classroom work which shifted focus from LOGO as a learning environment for general problem solving skills to LOGO as a context for learning about programming and computers, and reasons for the  shift; and finally, the second year, when teachers developed instructional strategies and revised classroom work to provide a particular type of structure to LOGO learning. Subjects were 25 third and fourth graders (11 boys, 14 girls) and 25 fifth and sixth graders (11 boys, 14 girls) encompassing a variety of ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds and a range of achievement levels.

The SMLN is a cooperative group of 56 libraries located within the five counties of Allegan, Berrien, Cass, Kalamazoo, and Van Buren. It is one of 15 regions of cooperation (ROCs) organized to provide an opportunity for all types of libraries to share resources and to fill interlibrary loan requests within the region, if possible, before referral to the major reference research libraries in the state. Following a preface, the document covers the history and development of the SMLN including its organization, funding, relationship to other  cooperatives, and accomplishments. A section on interlibrary cooperation and resource sharing covers legislation, establishment of multitype cooperatives, and cooperative services and programs in Michigan's ROCs. An overview examines cooperatives in several other states and provides detailed descriptions of activities in California and Texas. Issues and concerns in multitype networking generally are then outlined, followed by conclusions and recommendations to the SMLN. Data and additional information on multitype library networks are appended, and an extensive bibliography is provided. (THC)",

Phase One addressed the nature of the training needs common to library staff in rural public and school libraries, and began to investigate methods of delivery training to such a thinly distributed population that would be cost-effective, and ways of organizing the resources of many types of institutions into a delivery network to deliver this training effectively. This report presents the results of an extensive survey of the target group, as well as the results of a literature  search, discussions with library consultants throughout the province, and a survey of human and materials resources. An 11-page questionnaire designed to elicit data on the demographics of the target group (education background, types and sizes of the libraries in which they work, kinds of services offered, perceived training needs, and preferred learning experiences) was mailed to 246 public librarians and 668 school librarians, and received a 53% response rate.

Modules based on a common set of instructional objectives and examples were developed and delivered using three formats: a print packet, a videotape, and an interactive session at a computer terminal with print support. A total of 51 subjects from 2 library science classes and a set of student library workers were assigned to the treatment groups. The instructional sequence (script) presented an overview of the automated library system and explanations of the primary functions of the circulation system: searching for a book by author, title, or call number; placing a hold; and  obtaining patron information. (Appendix A presents the text version of the script.) The interactive version (Appendix B) used the same explanations, but subjects worked through examples at a terminal connected to the circulation database. The video version consisted of a narration of the script with displays of actual terminal screens for examples. A 15-question achievement test plotted procedural, interpretive, and general points on one dimension, and system overview, search, hold, and patron functions on the other. A 13-item questionnaire was appended to the final test instrument to obtain demographic data and comments (Appendix C). Although no statistically significant differences were found on the achievement measure, subjects in the video treatment group performed slightly better  than subjects in the text group, and both of these groups performed better than subjects in the interactive group. A discussion of the results and their implications and areas where additional research is needed conclude the report. (THC)",

In addition to discussions of each of the above issues, the report lists NCLIS commission members and commission staff, FY 1984 highlights, staff activities, international operations, and future plans. Appendices  comprise: the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science Act (Public Law 91-345); a summary of the report, &quot;Toward a National Program for Library and Information Services: Goals for Action&quot;; lists of NCLIS publications; projects and former members; and a fiscal statement for FY 1984.

Data were collected from six surveys. The first was a study of the population of scientists and engineers from nine fields of science conducted as part of a National Science Foundation study. It involved estimating many variables related to authorship,  journal use, library use, numeric database searching, and bibliographic database searching. Demographic information identifies scientists and engineers funded by the Department of Energy (DOE). The second, a survey of managers, administrators, operational professionals, and scientists and engineers engaged in research and development at Rocky Flats, Rockwell Energy Systems Group, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), obtained information about general reading, library use, awareness of services, and satisfaction with services. In addition, four surveys were conducted at the three library locations to obtain detailed information about recent uses of specific library materials and services. Detailed analyses including numerous tables and figures present the findings of these studies.  (THC)",

Among the basic elements required for staff and user training for the online catalog are a similar response and commitment on the part of the library to meeting the needs of both groups. The common requirements of the training programs include library personnel willing and qualified to lead workshops and meetings, and personnel able to write clear documentation and training materials. Other common features of training  programs for both staff and public users include; (1) database content, (2) communication requirements, (3) display content, and (4) change, e.g., new system features. For both the staff and the public it is necessary to accommodate different levels of background and preferences in instructional approaches. The individual program designed must be feasible within the organizational structure and size of the particular library, including attention to such things as content and frequency of training, and times and places in which it will be offered.

To achieve this goal, the college initiated an instructional delivery system that integrates academic courses, skills courses, and counseling services. The system teams up instructors, one representing an academic discipline and one representing a skills discipline, in curriculum development and instructional delivery. In addition, the instructors are teamed with a counselor in student assessment, guidance, and evaluation. This coordinated approach enables the college to understand and address the totality of a student's needs. The project report discusses the results of the  delivery system in terms of its achievements to date; the relationship of the program's achievements to its original objectives; changes made in program, resource allocation and staff from the original project proposal; and plans for the institutionalization of the delivery system.

Each of these key contributions suggests a number of policy issues at both state and institutional levels. This paper provides brief overviews of major influences with respect to each of these community college roles, and then raises a number of questions presenting pressing community college issues. Access issues are introduced by discussions of population trends projecting increases in both minority youth and older adult student groups; rural and &quot;exurban&quot; population and economic growth; challenges to the open door  philosophy; increased public attention to financial accountability and educational quality; and rapid social and economic changes and more varied student enrollment patterns. Questions related to economic development are raised within the context of the need for individuals and institutions to anticipate future developments and adapt continuously, of the growing needs of business and industry for specialized employee training, and of technological changes, particularly the use of computers, advanced telecommunications, and information technologies. Finally, issues are raised relating to community colleges' need to respond to state and local priorities in ways that combine responsiveness with accountability. (AYC)",

Following introductory material describing the ways in which postsecondary institutions respond to and contribute to economic development and change, the economic environment of the western United States is explored. Information is presented on personal income growth, employment patterns (1970-1984), unemployment rates, structures of the economies of the western states, and the occupational profile projected for the United States in 1990 as contrasted with that of 1980. In the next  section, trends in employment in major industrial categories are examined, along with projections for employment changes in specific occupational categories, a discussion of technological developments and their effects on industry, and an analysis of the characteristics of high technology industries. Finally, a discussion is provided of the role of community colleges in the maintenance and expansion of local economies. (AYC)",

A summary of the data, trends, and conditions presented indicates: (1) although there has been a general drift toward more reliance on state funds to finance community colleges, there is significant variation across states and from year to year within individual states; (2) severe constraints and fluctuations in major sources of support make it difficult for institutions to initiate necessary changes and plan for the future, with increased dependence on limited and highly variable  state revenues further hindering institutional initiative and flexibility; (3) substantial variations from state to state in support levels and expenditure patterns reflect different educational roles and institutional characteristics; (4) community college tuition and fees have increased sharply in many states, renewing debates over the appropriate level of community college charges in comparison to student charges in four-year institutions; (5) federal and other sources of support to community colleges have become increasingly limited in recent years, which in turn limits the ability of community colleges to provide employment training and educational access to lower income individuals; and (6) the financial outlook of community colleges is directly linked to state budgetary conditions  and political climates. Subsequent sections provide data and statistical analyses exploring the financial environment of the community colleges. (AYC)",

        "description":"Beginning in fall 1985, John Wood Community College (JWCC) is offering its students a guarantee that courses taken at the college will transfer to other institutions or the tuition paid by the student will be refunded. Each student applying for the Credit Transfer Guarantee must meet with a JWCC counselor. The student is responsible for indicating the institution he/she will attend and the courses to be transferred. The counselor consults articulation agreements and other sources and reports back to the student regarding the courses guaranteed to transfer. Both parties and the Dean of Student Services sign the agreement, which is official and binding. The guarantee is designed to encourage students to attend JWCC by reassuring them that the credits earned at the college can be  used at other institutions. In addition, the guarantee is intended to deal with the issues of transferability particular to Illinois, where each institution determines independently which courses it will accept and where virtually no courses are universally transferable. Early student reaction to the guarantee has been positive and may encourage students planning their future to attend JWCC instead of a four-year college. A copy of the agreement and informational materials for students are appended. (HB)",

Participants in the study were 29 families with an infant believed to be at psychiatric risk. Maternal depression was assessed at the time of family intake with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale; infants were assessed using both observational and psychometric measures at 7, 12, and 18 months of age. A closely matched control group was assessed at 12 and 18 months of age. Videotapes of 40 minutes of spontaneous mother-infant interaction were made in each family's home. A subsample of 13 mothers was asked to engage in a structured face-to-face interaction for 6 minutes after spontaneous interaction.  Findings revealed that the behavior of most mothers was neutral to negative in affect expression. Depressed mothers' involvement with their child was primarily intrusive or angry. In contrast to that of the mothers, infant behavior was more consistently neutral to negative in affect expression. Small but significant differences between depressed and case-control infants were found in mental and motor development. It is concluded that infants' affective and cognitive development may be undermined by daily interactions with a primary caregiver behaving in a disengaged or intrusive way. (RH)",

        "description":"This paper examines the validity of Vygotsky's interpretation of the private speech (PS) phenomenon on the basis of findings reported in the literature. A review of available findings provided support for an age-related shift from overt to covert means of verbal self-regulation and for an interpsychological to intrapsychological shift in the regulation of problem-solving behaviors. Several studies reported increases in self-regulatory PS following increases in task difficulty. Although correlational data suggested that these increases were associated with more successful task performance, further support for a self-guidance function was absent in studies that more directly examined the degree of correspondence between overt verbalizations and problem-solving behaviors. Relatively  little support was found for the curvilinear developmental hypothesis. A lack of self-regulatory PS was not a distinctive feature of impulsive children, who instead exhibited more task-irrelevant PS. Inconsistent findings hindered an interpretation of the influence of others upon the occurrence of PS. The relative absence of pertinent data precluded any appraisal of whether PS undergoes developmental changes in structure. While the above findings provided some basis for questioning the overall validity of Vygotsky's theoretical framework, this conclusion was tempered by a consideration of several methodological difficulties noted among the reviewed studies.

        "description":"This study examined the characteristics of the child's social network as it changes within the preschool period. Of particular interest is how the social network changes as the child moves from a more home-centered existence at 3 years to a more school-centered existence at 6 years of age. Also of concern is the effect of sex and socioeconomic status on the nature of the child's social network. A total of 85 children and their mothers were studied as part of a longitudinal research project. Each mother reported on their child's contacts with relatives, adults, and peers when the child was 3 and 6 years old. The results show that the child's social network composition and contacts change with age and vary as a function of the child's sex and socioeconomic status. For example, from  3 to 6 years children decrease contact with relatives and increase contact with peers and non-relative adults. Across age, but especially at 6 years of age, male subjects have more contact with male than female friends and female subjects have more contact with female than male friends. These findings illustrate how sex role socialization patterns are reflected in contact with same sex peers compared to opposite sex peers in the social network. In general, the findings suggest that the social network structure provides different types of interaction opportunities according to developmental level as well as sex and socioeconomic status of the child.

The personality characteristics conceptually associated with antisocial behavior were specified by seven psychologists using the California Child Q-sort (CCQ) to describe independently a prototypically antisocial adolescent. Next, CCQ descriptions of each adolescent in a longitudinal study of ego and cognitive development of 3-, 4-, 5-, 7-, 11-, and 14-year-olds were correlated with the prototype. The congruence between an actual CCQ description and the prototype was the index of antisocial personality. Undercontrol was operationalized similarly. Indices of antisocial personality and of undercontrol then  were related to indices of adolescent drug usage, self-concept, and parental child-rearing practices. Numerous external correlates distinguished between antisocial personality and undercontrol. Antisocial personality, but not undercontrol, predicted drug usage at age 14 in both sexes. The value systems of antisocial males reflect aspirations for wariness and uninvolvement. Parental child-rearing values foretold antisocial behavior and undercontrol more frequently in girls than in boys. (Author/RH)",

It is the premise of this paper that children's understanding of their emotional experience goes hand in hand with their understanding of social relations. The second part of the paper describes a study of how children conceptualize management of emotional expressiveness as a strategy for influencing interpersonal transactions. Thirty-two middle class children, relatively evenly distributed across grades 2, 5, and 8 and by gender, were interviewed regarding  their understanding of how emotional displays would be perceived by others. They also were asked if they thought children their own age and gender were more likely to show their real feelings to their peers or to adults. This question was followed by another asking the reason for their choice. Results indicate that children in this age span of about 7.5 to 13.5 years clearly recognize that emotional-expressive behavior impacts on others, whether it be genuine or dissembled expressive displays. Given such awareness of the communicative significance of emotional displays, they are also able to articulate who is the safer audience for seeing the genuine emotional display. (RH)",

        "description":"Examined were relationships between metamemory and strategic behavior in 130 impulsive and reflective children in fourth, fifth, and sixth grades. Of these, 77 had been tested 3 years earlier on multiple metamemory and memory tasks. At pretraining, children were assessed on metamemory, cognitive tempo, summarization skills, and teacher ratings of impulsive behavior in the classroom. Children in three experimental groups received prose summarization instructions, summarization instructions in conjunction with meta-cognitive training about the importance of a reflective approach to learning, or no instructions. Following training, children were again measured on tempo, summarization skills, and teacher ratings of impulsivity. Analyses of academic strategy use indicated superior  performance for children who had received both summarization and metacognitive training. Causal modeling analyses showed early metamemory as a causal antecedent of later strategy acquisition. Discussion highlights the dual importance of metacognitive knowledge as a precursor of later strategy acquisition and metacognitive skills as the &quot;executor&quot; for lower-level strategies.

More complex social pretend play was expected in the mixed age than in the same age condition. A second purpose of the study was to compare 5-year-old children's attempts to communicate pretend meanings with same age and younger partners. It was hypothesized that 5-year-olds would modify their attempts to construct social pretend play to accommodate the perceived ability of younger children. A total of 32 children 2 and 5 years of age were observed in same age and mixed age dyads as they played with a novel toy designed to elicit fantasy play. Each dyad was observed for 15 minutes. The complexity of social pretend play was rated in each  30 second interval. Meta-communication, teaching, attempts to direct, and imitation behaviors were recorded. Complex social pretend play was more frequent in mixed age dyads than same age 2-year-old dyads. The 5-year-olds used more verbal meta-communicative behaviors in mixed age than in same age dyads. In mixed age dyads, 5-year-olds more often performed teaching behaviors and attempted to direct the play, whereas 2-year-olds more often imitated their partners. (Author/RH)",

The purpose was threefold: (1) to determine whether older preschoolers were better decoders than younger preschoolers; (2) to see whether sex differences would be apparent throughout the preschool period or emerge only among older preschoolers; and (3) to test the hypothesis that male and female children are differentially sensitive to certain emotional cues. A total of 67 children 4 through 6 years of age from three preschool classes were shown six slides each of happy, angry, sad, surprise, afraid, and disgust expressions. Children's skills improved with age. Sex differences in the pattern of skills for the six emotions were present at all ages, although  they were significant only in the youngest group. The pattern of improvement across ages in decoding skills differed for each sex. (Author/RH)",

An additional 61 children were asked to draw pictures of germs. Results indicate that developmental changes in concepts of health and sickness as expressed in the interviews and drawings are basically consistent with developments reported in other studies of health-related concepts. Children above preschool age tended to be less egocentric and magical in accounts of illness and to use standard medical and cultural explanations of colds, germs, and  illness. Results neither affirm nor deny that operational logic is found in children's thinking about health and illness, but suggest that more intensive interviews presenting situations of complex, contrasting variables would be necessary before these forms of logic could be identified. The present study does support previous research in finding that younger children tend to have external, egocentric ideas about illness and that concepts of illness as internal processes come later.

The questionnaire included sections on strategy use, metamemory skills, and memory monitoring and control activities. Teachers were asked to characterize expected performance for children in their classes achieving at high, average, and low levels. Teachers predicted major differences in memory strategy use, memory knowledge, and memory monitoring activities as a function of classroom achievement level. Differences in responses across grade level occurred for items assessing memory strategies and self-testing activities, and for some of the memory  knowledge items. No differences in teachers' expectations at different grade levels were seen in evaluations of a rehearsal strategy, metamemory, or memory monitoring or control activities. Teachers showed reasonably veridical perceptions of memory development, especially in the area of memory strategies. However, findings suggested that teachers of the earlier grades may overestimate the metamemory, memory monitoring, and control skills of the children they teach. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to investigate the peer concepts held by 16 second-grade, 17 fourth-grade, and 17 sixth-grade students. A paired comparisons sociometric procedure was used to obtain children's descriptions of their classmates in the areas of reading, mathematics, drawing, and an athletic skill (running). In addition, the procedure measured children's liking for classmates. Independent measures of each child's actual skills or characteristics were obtained from reading and mathematics achievement test scores, a measure of running speed, and teachers' ratings of drawing ability and popularity. Analyses indicated little differentiation of ability attributes by either the second or fourth graders. Sixth graders viewed drawing ability and mathematics skill as quite separate from  other attributes, thus demonstrating partial differentiation of ability attributes. Accuracy of the children's choices relative to the objective measures showed increasing accuracy from second to fourth grade in judging reading skill, mathematics ability, and running speed. Decreased ability across grades was found in judging drawing ability. Moderate correspondence at younger levels, increasing through the sixth grade, was found between teachers' rankings of popularity and children's liking for peers. Findings thus indicated both the increasingly differentiated concepts of peers' abilities during the elementary school years and the limitations on concept differentiation resulting from changes in the salience of ability attributes over these years.

Specifically, cultural values and expectations held by adults who designed and worked in one infant/toddler center and the actual practices observed in videotapes of infants and toddlers at the center are explored. Findings are compared with results of three other studies conducted in the research setting, with the results of infant and toddler peer play studies reported in the literature, with responses of three other groups, and with &quot;standardized techniques&quot; of  childrearing advocated by early childhood professionals. It is concluded that (1) informants' views are similar to those of other adults who have been enculturated by training in early childhood education but are different from the views of adults who have not had this background; (2) advocated and observed practices are congruent with results of three studies of peer play done at the center; (3) results are congruent with informants' theory of success; and (4) results are congruent with literature in the field of early childhood education.

The sample consisted of 30 inner-city women with children younger than 12 years of age. Prior to the first general co-op meeting, mothers were interviewed and pretests were administered. Measures included the Life Experience Survey, the Behavior Stress Index, and the Social Network Assessment Scale. At the first general meeting, the Symptom Checklist 90-Revised, the Tension and Depression Subscales of the Profile of Moods States, and the Proxy Measure of Health  Status were administered. During the 28th week of operation, co-op members were reinterviewed and posttested. Two months after posttesting, a follow-up measure of co-op use was obtained. A steady increase in use of the co-op was observed as the women formed small groups and pairs that traded babysitting services. About half the women indicated that they found the co-op helpful. Co-op use continued after the study ended. Participation in the babysitting co-op did not have a differential impact on high- and low-stressed mothers. The implications of these findings are discussed. (RH)",

Conflict in families of adolescents was studied by examining three characteristics of family conflict (locus, content, and frequency) and changes in family cohesion and power in response to conflict. Using a clinically derived figure placement technique, 460 subjects including parents and 11- to 20-year-old adolescents represented their family twice, as it was typically and in an important conflict situation. Subjects were also interviewed about the nature of the conflict. At a descriptive level, conflict in both marital and parent-adolescent dyads was frequently  reported, and conflict over deviant behavior was described in addition to more mundane issues. Across adolescence, reports of parent-adolescent conflict increased, especially those related to autonomy. In general, conflict decreased cohesion and changed power relations in the representations of family structure. In particular, compared to others, conflict in the marital dyad was related to decreased cohesion and increased cross-generational coalitions, whereas conflict between mothers and adolescents was related to shifts in power. Both cross-generational coalitions and reverse power hierarchies were portrayed more often in conflict concerning deviant behavior. No gender differences were found. (Author/ABL)",

Subjects included college students whose parents were divorced (N=99) and college students from intact families (N=110) who completed self-report questionnaires measuring closeness, socioeconomic status, fathers' behaviors, parenting style, and divorce experience. In agreement with previous findings, divorced fathers received lower average ratings than did married fathers. Perceiving the father as accepting and trustworthy was strongly related to feelings of closeness to  him. When the effects of other variables were held constant with multiple regression, ratings of closeness to fathers were higher when fathers more frequently performed supportive behaviors for the offspring, more frequently initiated interaction with the offspring, avoided getting angry with the offspring, and avoided performing some general problem behaviors. Group differences may result from differences between the fathers on these variables or from other variables which are directly affected by divorce. (Author/ABL)",

        "description":"This publication is designed to help educators deal with the problems that arise after an adolescent's suicide. It recommends that teachers should be able to detect differences in students' responses to emotional problems. Following a preface and a brief review of the extent of the problem, the first chapter discusses which adolescents are vulnerable to suicide, noting that adolescent suicide is rarely precipitated by a single factor, but usually is a combination of factors. Risk factors described include depression; loss; moving; lack of attention from working parents; disappointments; substance abuse; chronic illness and handicaps; impulsivity; negative life events; and physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. The second chapter discusses dealing with the school situation after a  suicide, describing the bereavement and recovery stages of denial, anger, acceptance, and resolution. A 10-step crisis management plan for suicide and how to put it into action is discussed in the third chapter. Establishing a school crisis team for dealing not only with suicides but also with other crises, such as accidents, drug overdoses, tornadoes, earthquakes, bomb threats, even riots, is discussed in the fourth chapter. Three levels of a school crisis team are presented: individual building, central office, and community support groups. Finally, community education in suicide prevention for two key audiences, parents and the media, is discussed. The appendix includes checklists for at-risk adolescents, symptoms of suicidal youth, and suicide threat. A bibliography is included.  (ABL)",

It shows what to look for when adopting or adapting ready-made curricula, and suggests important lessons that ought to be part of any prevention-education sequence, including those developed by schools and school systems for their own use. The document opens with a summary checklist of the essential points to consider in selecting a prevention curriculum, adapting one for one's special needs, or designing one's own. This checklist is divided into three parts: before one begin, as one chooses a curriculum, and when the curriculum is implemented. These points are among those listed: (1) determine the nature and extent of the  drug problem in one's area; (2) develop a clear, concise policy against drug use in one's school; (3) commit to using a curriuculum that conveys the no-use message; (4) provide for keeping parents informed about the curriculum; (5) establish a schedule for implementation and monitoring; (6) provide regular assessment; and (7) maintain communication among all persons and groups involved in the drug prevention efforts. Curriculum guidelines are given for early childhood, upper elementary, middle school and junior high school, and high school levels.

        "description":"The general impression conveyed by the literature in the social psychology of aging is that various dimensions of the self, including self-esteem, are relatively fixed and stable by the later stages of the life cycle. Existing research implies that the self-esteem of older persons is higher than that of younger persons, and also more stable or resistant to external influences. This study examined the influence of social, familial, and eonomic factors on the self-esteem of older persons. Subjects (N=4,122) were adults age 55 and over who agreed to receive mailed questionnaires when contacted randomly by telephone. Self-esteem, marital satisfaction, relationship with neighbors, education, health, family income, and employment were assessed. Results showed that the self-esteem of  older persons was positively affected by education, income (for males), health, and frequency of interaction with friends. Marital satisfaction had a positive effect on self-esteem second in magnitude only to the effect of health; for males, the effect of marital satisfaction was stronger for the retired than for the employed. No other family related variables had significant effects on self-esteem except that never-married women had slightly lower self-esteem than others. Results suggest that self-esteem is still responsive to some social factors among older persons, and therefore should not be ignored in research or theory on the psychological well-being of the elderly.

Despite the importance of supervisor ratings to the training of counselors and therapists, very little attention has been devoted to the overall reliability (generalizability) of these ratings. This study examined the generalizability of supervisor ratings of counselors-in-training. Participants included 23 counselor trainees enrolled in a masters level prepracticum course and 9 doctoral-level counseling supervisors. Ratings of counselor and supervisor effectiveness were collected through the use of the Counselor Effectiveness Scale. At the beginning of the term, practicum trainees were randomly assigned to supervisors. Each prepracticum counselor audiotaped a counseling session with a volunteer client  on each of 6 weeks. Within a week following each counseling session, counselors met with their supervisors for a 60 minute supervision session. Following each supervision session, the supervisor rated the effectiveness of the counselor, and the counselor rated the effectiveness of the supervisor. Generalizability analyses were performed. Results showed generalizability of supervisor's ratings of counselor effectiveness were affected more by the number of occasions on which the counselor was rated than by the length of the rating instrument. Similar findings were observed for counselor ratings of supervisor effectiveness. (ABL)",

In addition, school psychologists must recognize that professional expertise brought to practice in the schools is not value free. It is imperative that those who see themselves as helping others, especially children, clarify their ideals, goals, norms, and standards of behavior. It is important to consider questions of individual responsibility in the face of authority or in the face of unethical or ineffective behavior on the part of one's colleagues. School psychologists must be aware of their own biases and weaknesses. They must also become aware of the values of the community, and finally, of the values of the individuals with whom they interact. While psycholgists make  every effort to reconcile any differences which arise, individual ethical integrity must remain paramount. The school psychologist who fulfills the role mandated by law, follows ethical guidelines, functions effectively in a bureaucratic structure, and when necessary, goes \"beyond the guidelines\" may still encounter ethical dilemmas. Psychologists must gain practice in dealing with the processes involved in resolving ethical dilemmas, and must receive the professional support needed to live up to standards and ideals. (ABL)",

        "description":"Thousands of workers have been dislocated from jobs in the textile and apparel industries as a result of recessions and structural changes in the economy. Because of the large concentrations of female workers in these industries, women have been particularly vulnerable to dislocation. This study examined job dislocation and factors that affect women's reemployment or retraining for other employment. Subjects were women (N=120) who had been dislocated from textile or apparel manufacturing plants and were unemployed, reemployed, or enrolled in classroom-based job training at a county vocational technical institute in 1985 and 1986. Subjects were interviewed face-to-face or completed questionnaires. Results showed that the job training group was significantly different from the  unemployed and employed groups, and that variables related to the stage of life cycle were primarily responsible for these differences. The job training group was younger and had more children at home. These findings suggest that younger women who had a number of years remaining in the job market and also faced the economic demands associated with earlier stages of the family life cycle, were more likely to believe that it was worthwhile to retrain for future jobs, and that older women were more likely to believe that retraining for their remaining years in the job market was of little value.

        "description":"A professional role that may be one of the most immersively demanding professions is that of the Roman Catholic priest. This internalized role creates psychological/emotional territorialities which regulate the person's sexuality, societal status, professional rituals/behaviors, social interrelationship expectations, and work rituals. The disciplining of one's psychology as a priest involves a process of the suppression of feelings which has been called professional protective emotional suppression (PPES). The alcoholic has held unexpressed and unresolved feelings throughout his/her life, creating a high state of internal anxiety. Compensation expressions are characteristics common in persons suffering from the disease of alcoholism. The role of a Catholic priest superimposes  onto the recovering alcoholic a layer of life complexity that may create and reinforce psychological unhealthiness. The dimensons of PPES may come together to create in the priest a ritualized suppression of feelings which has developed through the years. The priest is suffering from alcoholism and PPES. In treatment of the alcoholic priest the church needs to recognize that alcoholic persons in early recovery may react to their work responsibilities excessively and completely, thus camouflaging the real problem issues, and supervisors should receive some training in understanding chemical dependency. Recovering priests should be involved in Alcoholics Anonymous or the equivalent and counseling is recommended. More intensive prevention/precautionary education concerning alcohol/drug  issues needs to be introduced at all stages of seminary education. (ABL)",

Three groups of female tertiary students with a mean age of 20 (146 upper middle-class Anglo-Australians, 71 working-class Anglo-Australians, and 89 working-class Italian-Australians) were compared in a study of the influence of class and culture on self-esteem, life-satisfaction, and a number of measures associated with gender. There were no significant differences between the groups on any measure of self-esteem or life satisfaction, but the Italian-Australians were significantly less satisfied with their gender than were the two other groups. The three groups placed equally high value on working outside the home and perceived themselves as moderately  ambitious. The working-class Anglo- and Italian-Australian women had greater commitment to tertiary studies than did their upper middle-class peers. There were few differences between the two Anglo-Australian groups, suggesting that at least for young women who choose to pursue tertiary studies, social class is not an important variable when feelings about their gender, themselves, and satisfaction with their lives is examined. In contrast, the cultural comparison yielded differences on a number of measures associated with gender. (ABL)",

This affect produced in the partial match conditions may be a result of concerns regarding the interaction itself, and thus it could be expected that high self-monitors would experience more negative affect in the partial match conditions because the partial match does not provide the high self-monitor enough information to guide his behavior. This study  was designed to replicate the &quot;schema-triggered affect&quot; and to test this hypothesis on the effects of self-monitoring in the partial match conditions in terms of subject's concerns over the nature of the impending interpersonal interaction. High and low self-monitoring female subjects (N=8) were shown profiles of male targets whom they expected to date.

To investigate the effectiveness of two computer-assisted metacognitive strategies on the development of sequential reading skills of ESL fourth grade students, 68 randomly selected Spanish-speaking students from a public school in a low socioeconomic setting in Puerto Rico were classified in  combined language proficiency and reading ability levels and were randomly assigned to one of two treatments. Both treatment conditions used computer-mediated texts as the instructional materials. The Tutorial-Direct Monitoring Strategy (TDMS) consisted of A. S. Palincsar and A. L. Brown's three-step monitoring technique, skill modeling reading texts, and comprehension exercises, whereas the Schema-Direct Monitoring Strategy (SDMS) used reading texts, comprehension exercises, and a monitoring strategy in flowchart form. The results of the study demonstrated significant differences in favor of the TDMS.

Subjects, 89 students from several Midwestern suburban school districts and 15 inservice and preservice teachers enrolled at a nearby college, were asked to write definitions of 16 words, four each of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. The definitions were classified into seven categories: category, synonym/antonym, explanation, descriptional or functional explanation, instance, use in a sentence, and repetition or association. Results indicated that adults wrote more definitions that were classified as categorical than did the fourth graders. Results also indicated that significant variation existed in the categories of  definitions for the different parts of speech. For example, categorical definitions were most common for nouns but almost nonexistent for verbs. Adults showed similar definitional patterns. These results confirm that it is not productive to attempt to conceptualize a single definition frame or schema for all parts of speech but rather to assume multiple definitional schemata.

A 24-item Likert-style censorship scale was used to measure attitudes toward censorship. Strong agreement with affirmative items would suggest that a respondent was pro-censorship; the reverse was true for the negatively directed items. After completing the censorship scale, subjects were tested on the vocabulary subtest of the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, a 100-item multiple-choice test designed to yield a raw score indicating vocabulary knowledge. Following the vocabulary measure, subjects were tested with two separately administered cloze tests. The first cloze test was  constructed from a newspaper article strongly opposing censorship, while the second cloze test used an article strongly favoring censorship. Findings suggested that individuals with weaker vocabularies tended to have more favorable attitudes toward censorship than their counterparts with stronger vocabularies. Yet, comprehension as measured by the cloze tests suggested that attitude toward censorship had no effect on performance.

Discussion of whole language centers on a suggestion to redesign research report units to capitalize on student interest and to develop expertise on focused topics, and on a suggestion to use problem-solving journals in the elementary science classroom.

Among the reading skills assessed were single word identification, word attack, and reading comprehension. The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Tests-Revised provided an estimate of verbal IQ. Reading comprehension was assessed by the Canadian Test of Basic Skills. Accuracy of single word reading and of nonsense word decoding were assessed by two subtests of the Woodcock Reading Mastery Test, Word Identification and Word Attack. Three phonological awareness tests were  administered: (1) the Auditory Analysis Test; (2) the Odd Word Out task of Bradley and Bryant; and (3) a phonological task in which children repeated three- and four-syllable real and nonsense words pronounced by the examiner. Short term memory was assessed by the Digit Span subtest from the WISC-R (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised). Results indicated that digit naming speed, phonological awareness, and short term memory contributed variance to reading skills. However, phonological awareness tests were not intercorrelated and, with one exception, did not correlate with tests of naming speed or memory.

In the Story Workshop approach to writing instruction the elements from which everything else builds for the writer are seeing and voice, both of which, working together, generate and organize movement. Three principles underlie the Story Workshop emphasis upon voice and guide the specific techniques and coachings used by teachers in class: (1) the teacher must accept the students' right to their own language, their cultural background, and their skills level; (2) the class is inherently democratic in that it draws upon  capacities most students already possess; and (3) the syllabus takes students through a sequence of writing tasks beginning with familiar basic forms that call forth naturally their own distinct and most often used voices and proceeding through those which place an increasing demand upon more conceptual and analytical capabilities. A story workshop format moves through a series of exercises and activities that build sequentially: opening recall, oral reading of models, recall and comment on oral reading, word exercises, oral telling, in-class writing, oral read-back of in-class writing, oral reading of selections from student work, and final recall.

Kuhlmeier,&quot; giving educators the right to exercise &quot;editorial control over the style and content of student speech in school-sponsored expressive activities so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.&quot; A study explored the immediate reaction to &quot;Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier&quot; from professional press associations, journalism reviews, and newspaper editorials and used the results of a mail survey of high school advisers to assess the current level of prepublication review and controversial content and anticipated impact of the case on student publications in Tennessee. The study also reported survey results on the amount of attention the case received  in schools, the advisers' perceptions of attitudes of student staff members, faculty, and other adults in the community, and the advisers' own attitudes about the outcome of the case. Survey results indicate that &quot;Hazelwood&quot; had no immediate effect on Tennessee high school publications and few advisers anticipate changes in their publishing situations, a third of which (53% of newspapers) are already subject to prepublication review by school administrators. Professional and editorial reaction to the decision was mixed. (Two tables of data and 63 notes are included.) (MS)",

        "description":"In early 1988, the U.S. Supreme Court, in &quot;Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier,&quot; held that school administrators may exercise &quot;editorial control over the style and content of student speech in school-sponsored expressive activities so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.&quot; A positive outcome from this decision would be a renewed interest in the teachings of ethics in the high school journalism curriculum. Although there is a plethora of literature dealing with student-press law, little scholarly attention has been paid to the teaching of media ethics within the public academy. There is a growing feeling that teaching First Amendment rights is necessary, but teaching students to think analytically and to act with moral conviction is  just as essential. Since many practicing journalists receive their first formal training on the high school newspaper, it is imperative that their education be well-grounded in the ethical standards of the profession. This pedagogical objective necessitates a &quot;values oriented&quot; rather than a &quot;values free&quot; approach to journalism education. The teaching of journalistic values, whereby students are the passive receptors of knowledge, is a necessary but insufficient condition for ethics training. Students need to be more actively involved in this values-oriented education, and the pedagogical tool through which this can be accomplished is the &quot;case study simulation&quot; method based upon sound principles of moral reasoning.

        "description":"Word processing does not, in itself, teach revision. Students with incomplete revision strategies will not begin revising at a higher level simply by using a word processor. New computer strategies for teaching revision are needed--revision strategies that use the computer to reorganize, elaborate, and strengthen what has already been written. For example, the following revision strategies are more likely to occur with a computer than without one: (1) outlining; (2) creating a &quot;stairway&quot; of logically elaborated points; (3) writing cumulative sentences through the addition of noun phrases, verb phrases, and absolutes; (4) writing new introductions, using the insert function and the copy/move function of the software; (5) using the search-and-replace function to check style; and  (6) creating a computer monitor exchange, a &quot;collaborative revision&quot; which allows writers to act as readers and editors for fellow classmates. All of these activities can be implemented on the computer as lesson files--a planned sequence of activities operating as word processing text files, which offer directed help for a specific type of assignment, a specific grade level, or a specific type of activity. (A figure illustrating the &quot;stairway strategy&quot; is included, and three appendixes consisting of earlier reports on revising with word processing; four students' strategies for revision; and a student's essay with subsequent revisions noted are attached.)

Language arts teachers need to be thoroughly versed in content and methodology recommendations made by linguists. One such recommendation, for example, is that students should understand sentence patterns in English. These patterns include subject-predicate, subject-predicate-direct object, subject-linking verb-predicate adjective, and subject-predicate-indirect object-direct object patterns, among others. Students should also attach meaning to the concept of expanding sentences, sentences which can increase in size through the use of modifiers, appositives, dependent clauses, and compounding. It is also important for learners to understand concepts such as stress,  pitch, and juncture. Learners should be able to change sentences in functional writing and speaking situations from kernel sentences to those involving questions, negatives, and commands or requests. Finally, students, with teacher guidance, need to understand the concept of usage as it relates to standard and nonstandard English in oral and written communication of content. (MM)",

        "author":["Switzer, Jo Young"],
        "description":"As increasing numbers of postsecondary learners enroll in commuter campuses, speech communication departments can identify the characteristics which make commuting students somewhat different from their counterparts on residential campuses. Priorities of these two groups differ--students whose primary focus in life is the college experience contrast with commuting students with drastically different and demanding activities. The maturity level is also different, with commuting students tending to be older and more mature. A third area of difference is the focus of the students' academic interests. Vocationally-oriented majors have become increasingly popular. The implications of these basic differences are significant for speech communication faculty, and curricular adaptations  can be made to accommodate these differences. Commuter campus classes could, for example, require few assignments which mandate that students meet in specific groups outside of class. In classes, innovative teaching strategies can engage the interest of the commuter student, methods such as interdisciplinary orientation, peer teaching, and wide diversity of materials. Because of the maturity level of commuter students, faculty members may need to shift their orientations away from that of omniscient authorities. Finally, speech communication co-curricular activities can be modified for the commuter student by, for example, planning flexibility in practice schedules and moderating travel time for extracurricular programs. These adaptation can provide an impetus for development and  strengthening of the speech communication curriculum. (MM)",

Results showed that a significant number (nearly 56%) of public relations practitioners perceived a conflict between management's goal for public relations and their own. Practitioners tended to favor a &quot;mutual understanding&quot; definition of public relations' goals; they believed their managements tended to prefer publicity, public information, or persuasion goals. Finally, public relations  practitioners who perceived a dissimilarity between management's goals for public relations and their own, demonstrated significantly lower morale than practitioners who perceived comparability between management's goals and their own, as demonstrated by job satisfaction; similar differences were found with regard to predictions of likelihood of remaining with the same employer, and in the same career; and whether they would take the same job or enter the same career all over again, knowing what they know now.

Examples of such films include the &quot;Death Wish&quot; trilogy, and &quot;Sudden Impact.&quot; Categories of depictions of evil include: (1) expressions of evil in society (the breakdown of social order, wicked youth, corrupt justice systems); (2) expressions of evil in the appearance of the criminal and in the behavior of the criminal; and (3) the protagonist as evil (discussing the moral and physical journey from respectable, normal citizen through  physical danger and moral ambiguity to excessive, contemptible violence, i.e. the transformation from goodness through amorality to evil). The social implications of evil in the vigilante film include increased fear of victimization as a result of watching violence on television and in films, and the blurring of the distinction between good and evil.

Usefulness of the matrix was demonstrated by the analysis of a problematic set of FCC cases: those concerning the character qualifications of broadcast licensees. The matrix should allow for the common elements of disparate legal discourse to be revealed more clearly so that better policies can be made within the FCC via its application, not only in relation to the question of the character qualifications of licensees,  but in all commission legislative, executive and judicial functions aimed at promoting the general welfare through the powerful broadcast media.

Grips does this by creating and producing original plays that retain the idealistic moment of hope that social relations and people themselves can be qualitatively changed. &quot;Grips&quot; is a German slang term for wit, common sense, and imagination all in one. Its meaning, in the context of the company's title, is to use one's wits and imagination to overcome repression. In the 1980s, after nearly two decades of efforts by Grips to propogate the idea of a realistic, emancipatory theater for children and youth in the Federal Republic of Germany, the company remains very much in the  forefront of the theater scene in Europe and the exception to the rule for much of youth theater around the world. The sucess of Grips productions has prompted more playwrights to concentrate on youth theater. Most important for the effectiveness of Grips itself is its accent on continuity. The historical struggle of the Grips ensemble to develop collective theater work is exemplary, and their experiments with emancipatory theater have indeed brought children's theater to a new stage.

        "description":"Nebraska's Omaha Magic Theatre (OMT) and playwright Megan Terry are concerned with producing socially relevant, issue-oriented musical plays, focusing on young people and the adults who influence their emotional lives. OMT's &quot;Theatre of Process&quot; focuses upon the performing artist to develop and test ways to make theater more meaningful, exciting, and accessible to audiences. To help reach this goal, Terry listens to professional counselors, social workers, and OMT audiences in post-performance discussions to explore the causes of social problems besetting the American family. Each of her plays is constructed around a chosen conceptual theme, then grounded in a contextual situation. For example, &quot;American King's English for Queens,&quot; written in 1978, looks at the influence of  language and sexism on children's upbringing. In &quot;Goona Goona,&quot; Terry explores the cyclical effects of domestic violence upon the physical, emotional, and ethical development of children, using Punch and Judy imagery and acrobatic feats of physical endurance. These texts serve as acting exercises for student actors to explore thematic issues in a visceral manner, and they stimulate further discussions of adolescent issues. Though secondary teachers may choose to emphasize the didactic nature inherent to varying degrees within each text, Megan Terry's artistic approach ensures a thought-provoking, theatrical experience for mature audiences.

        "description":"Several forces are allowing, for the first time in the history of television, the creation of prime time texts with lesbian characters. Chief among these forces are the relatively marginalized position of broadcast television brought on by increasing cable penetration and home video ownership, liberalized censorship guidelines on the part of the networks, the demonstrated commercial viability of gay-themed material in other mass media, the appeal of emerging social issues in general as a backdrop for broadcast productions, and an increased public awareness of homosexuals triggered by the AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) epidemic. In order to examine these changes as they influence the portrayal of lesbians and to offer insights into a male-dominated industry, a study  identified and explicated some of the external forces that affect the development of prime-time texts and their choice as prime-time programs. Seven interviews with media activists from the gay community and with network executives were conducted, and television programs with lesbian characters were analyzed. The analysis revealed that lesbians are generally portrayed in a way that will reinforce mainstream cultural values, although there are exceptions on occasion. Findings suggest that before texts will be permitted to take more risks with the audience, television executives will have to be convinced that the potential financial payoff in terms of ratings makes such actions worthwhile.

Research demonstrates that at least 15 to 20% of all students suffer from debilitating apprehension when speaking. The number who experience moderate nervousness may be even higher. As a result of not asking questions, students may remain content with ambiguous information; seek clarification from a classmate; approach the instructor after class; or never think in different ways about the phenomenon under discussion. None of the choices fosters effective classroom learning. All things considered, an instructor's behavior plays a large part in determining whether students will open up when they do not understand or when they want more insight. The  following four areas form a framework for handling classroom questions supportively: 1) the creation of supportive classroom climates; 2) the importance of listening; 3) confrontational questions and ways of managing them; and 4) additional suggestions and caveats for handling student questions.

        "description":"A study examined structural determinants of opinion expression by merging two theoretical perspectives: the &quot;spiral of silence&quot; model advanced by Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann, and the structural approach to communication research offered by Phillip Tichenor, George Donohue, and Clarice Olien. The study also distinguished between different forms of opinion expression in terms of: 1) the degree to which the expression is public, and 2) the degree to which feedback is immediate and potentially hostile. Subjects, 478 mass communications students at a midwestern university, were asked their opinions on two social issues, the banning of pornography and the passage of a mandatory seat-belt law. They were also asked about their perceptions of majority opinion in their hometowns and their  willingness to express their opinions on these two topics in their hometowns. Results showed significant differences in willingness to express opinion in smaller communities, i.e., those in which the media serve a predominantly distributive function, than in larger, more pluralistic ones, i.e., those in which the media serve more of a feedback function in response to the presence of diverse social and political groups. Specifically, perceived congruity with majority opinion is a significant predictor of two forms of opinion expression in small, but not large, communities. Results suggest that &quot;fear of confrontation&quot; in smaller communities may inhibit opinion expression to a greater extent than the &quot;fear of isolation&quot; mechanism proposed by Noelle-Neumann.

        "description":"To investigate the temporally ordered process in image and issue learning as it affects the voting decision, a study conducted a secondary analysis of panel survey data from Wisconsin during the 1976 presidential elections. The study hypothesized that, because of the difficulty in understanding complex issues, voters rely on image evaluations for initial candidate preference--issue positions are then learned to support the image-based choice. The survey consisted of random telephone interviews: the first set of interviews was completed shortly before the first presidential debates between incumbent Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter; those who agreed to be reinterviewed were called again between the first and second debates. The third interviews occurred after the four debates but  before the election; and final interviews followed the election. A total of 164 respondents continued throughout the interviews. Measurements included vote intention, candidates' personal image, respondents' position on four political issues, ideological differences, and party identification and leaning. Precommitted or &quot;one-issue&quot; voters were eliminated, leaving 123 respondents for analysis. Causal analysis revealed that for Carter, images at an initial time period determined later candidate preference and issue learning. Also, image evaluations for Carter occurred at the beginning of the decision-making process. For Ford, however, images did not predict later issue learning and candidate preference--initial issues were the predictor. Also for Ford, vote intention played a significant  role in later issue learning. (Four tables of data, 4 figures, and 49 references are appended.) (MM)",

After a brief introduction, the second section of this paper compiles and discusses trends in female labor force participation in 136 countries. Section III reviews labor supply models helping to explain women's decision to seek jobs. Section IV explores factors possibly responsible for differences in the female labor force participation rate among countries and through time, with special emphasis on education's role. Section V  examines two related questions. First, are educated women more likely to participate in the labor force than uneducated ones? Second, will educated women participate for longer periods than uneducated ones? Results suggest that education positively affects the incidence of female labor force participation and women's lifetime length of participation in the labor market. In fact, an extra year of schooling results in two more years of participation. This finding is discussed in the context of alternative policies that may increase femals' role in economic activity.

Hodgkinson's values hierarchy was used to define actions that more rational frameworks might dismiss or explain inadequately. The hierarchy included three types of values: transrational values grounded in ethics or principles, rational values based on an individual's assessment of consequences or consensus, and subrational values related to personal preferences. Study data were collected through interiews with a school system's 15 principals and used to produce individual case studies and a cross-case analysis. Results showed that principals' personal values significantly influenced their actions,  particularly when the initial decision to adopt computers was made. Most principals based their responses on values of consensus and consequences. Principals whose perceptions initially favored either ethics or personal preference seemed to shift gradually over time toward consequences. Data relating to the influence of personal values provided additional insights extending beyond those furnished by planned change, school improvement, or principal effectiveness research perspectives. Because generalization from these study data is difficult, further research is necessary to determine if the value orientations examined here are characteristic responses to the adoption of computers only or typical for most educational innovations.

        "description":"While researchers can describe how some effective principals perform in some situations, little is known about what shapes their practice and what meaning they find in such practice. This report is part of a larger series exploring principals' problem-solving strategies and thought processes. This paper examines one problem-solving dimension (flexibility) as related to relatively unstructured and messy problems. The hypotheses were that (1) principals' problem-solving would demonstrate many of the same flexibility and inflexibility attributes found in problem-solving used by workers in other domains; and (2) principals demonstrating overt practices judged as highly effective would demonstrate greater problem-solving flexibility than their less effective peers. The study  interviewed 22 elementary school principals (1 female, 21 male) in subsets over a 2-year period; 6 were designated as &quot;expert&quot; by the principals' own boards and through extensive interviewing. Results showed that several inferential &quot;errors&quot; (or inflexibilities) influenced by cognitive factors were made, including overweighting vividness or importance, generalizing from a small or biased sample, and overuse and misuse of theories. Inflexibility asociated with motivational influences or the principals' mood were also common. Among certain principals, there was strong evidence of cognitive flexibility, expressed in &quot;opportunistic&quot; planning approaches to problem-solving. &quot;Expert&quot; principals avoided errors, controlled their moods, and responded to opportunities in the situation. Non-experts  made errors, were unable to control their moods, and were less opportunistic in the problem setting.

Since public school principals play a vital role in implementing court rulings, school board regulations, and state laws, their attitudes toward desegregation litigation is important. This study focused on principals' perceptions, because a 1983 study indicated that Texas schools continue to segregate Mexican-American children. The study attempts to determine the extent of agreement or disagreement toward desegregation rulings by a randomly chosen sample of 600 Texas principals. Using  chi-square and other techniques, the study found that a significant percentage of principals agreed with the court decisions. Years of experience and ethnic origin were variables influencing principals' agreement or disagreement with selected court decisions. Sex, type of school, and school district size did not seem to affect agreement or disagreement. Research is needed to determine whether principals' knowledge of school law influences their level of agreement or disagreement.

        "description":"This report presents a very detailed look at the elementary school principal's day-to-day activities. The executive summary highlights the study's chief findings and suggests where major problems exist. Although concerns have been raised about student behavior and discipline, results indicate that most elementary principals at the Montgomery County (Maryland) Public Schools (MCPS) can effectively carry out their roles as disciplinarians and a orchestrators of school climate. They are also doing good liaison work with parents and the community. The study did identify some pressing problems related to instructional leadership (curriculum implementation, testing, and training for new principals); staffing (allocation, selection, and evaluation); and communication among schools and  central offices. Recommendations for solving these problems are contained in the summary. The report then presents a typical day in the life of an elementary school principal. The remainder of the report describes the various activities and interactions encountered by MCPS principals as they fulfill their job responsibilities. Principals are seen as instructional leaders, staff leaders, creators of school climate, disciplinarians, and community relations and special program managers. Job satisfaction levels are also mentioned briefly. Two appendices are attached. Appendix A contains graphic information concerning principals' time apportionments. Appendix B contains tables presenting detailed findings for each study issue. (MLH)",

        "description":"Spain's transition from dictatorship to pacific and stable democracy without producing major national convulsions is remarkable in a world where many such attempts have been made and most have failed. Within the context of government reform, this study identifies and examines strengths and weaknesses of the regionalization process in education 10 years after the changes began. The study identifies the special characteristics of Spain's &quot;regional problem&quot;; the creation of 17 regional, decentralized governments intended to resolve that problem; and the forces behind discontinuing the decentralization movement until at least 1990. Data were gathered in Spain over an 8-month period, using a field study methodology. Interviews were conducted with classroom teachers, top Ministry of  Education officials, constitutional lawyers, senior politicians, distinguished writers, and regional officials. Results show that 10 years after regionalism began, coordinated educational planning encompassing the Ministry of Education Council and the six Autonomous Communities with delegated authority was nearly nonexistent. Coordinated actions between the six regional systems and the Ministry were noticeably absent. Tensions between regional educational officials in historic communities and the national officials are partly responsible for division of authority problems. Worsening debts though deficit spending have not facilitated agreement. Included are 58 endnotes in Spanish and English. (MLH)",

        "author":["Tyree, Alexander K., Jr."],
        "description":"This paper shows how, in two suburban high schools, Cherry Glen and Pinehill, teachers' work control interacted with normative and social integration in their effect upon teachers' engagement with their work. In each school, a two-person team initially observed, and later interviewed, eight teachers in English, math, foreign language, social studies, and science departments. The core sample of 16 teachers' interviews was supplemented by classroom observations, as well as additional short interviews with 10 other teachers or counselors at each school. After an initial review of the literature on teacher engagement, a brief account of the methodology, and contrasts between the school district communities and teachers, an extended discussion ensues of findings from each school. The  first general topic is normative and social integration of teachers, which includes such topics as participation, curriculum adherence, teacher camaraderie, technical updating, content/skills focus, and professional engagement. The second topic is the teachers' work control, which includes control of instruction and control of intrinsic rewards of teaching. (In the section on Pinehill School, gender-related differences in teacher engagement and control are also extensively discussed.) The final part of each section discusses the relationship between normative and social integration, work control, and professional engagement. The findings of this paper do not support reform proposals that would call for using universal increases in either work control or social integration as levers to  increase teachers' engagement in all schools. They do, however, support reforms that take into account the complexities of actual school relationships. A bibliography of 52 items is included. (TE)",

Findings from the reports were qualitatively integrated using propositional analysis, a technique that traces findings, generalizations, and recommendations and recasts them in ways that are relevant to the study. While these findings indicate a generally positive effect of MBO on productivity and attitudes, the study revealed four elements and processes in MBO that have been  linked with efficacy: participation, interaction between supervisors and subordinates, managerial support, and positive reinforcement. While MBO programs generally lead to improved productivity and attitudes, several factors leave the cause of the gains open to interpretation: the frequent absence of control groups, a failure to note specific management philosophy behind each MBO program, a lack of description of the implementation process and its effects, and a lack of detail about day-to-day decision making and its effects. A 24-item bibliography is included and 10 tables from the study are appended. (TE)",

        "description":"Maine Bill L.D. 1228, passed in June 1985, changed the groundrules for administrator certification, giving district-based administrators and others (as opposed to universities) the planning, support, and review authority over competency development of candidates for administrator certification or recertification. Between July 1985 and September 1987, three multi-dimensional sites tested the new law. This paper focuses on three questions that arose from these pilot attempts to place the responsibility for the development of administrator competencies in the hands of local collegial teams: (1) How did those responsible for certification or renewal assess the candidates' existing competencies at the outset of the project? (2) How were the growth plans conceived and carried out? and  (3) What procedures were used to assess the outcomes of the development process, and was there evidence of growth that could serve as a basis for certification decisions? Findings showed that Maine administrators and aspirants to administration were unable to make the Administrator Action Plan work cleanly for three reasons. First, field-based assessment teams lacked a common conceptual model for administrative competency against which to define and measure performance. Second, practicing administrators did not have time to provide continuous, first-hand observation of performance and personal feedback to candidates. Finally, the field-based administrator certification programs were afflicted with ambiguity about their goals. Nevertheless, the pilot programs did provide collegial networks  the support and responsibility for professional growth, and were therefore valued by participants. (TE)",

The experience of using the Concerns Based Adoption Model in formative evaluation of these  programs indicates that it can assist the evaluator in defining program elements and interpreting related teacher concerns and use, and that the data can guide the program staff in monitoring clients' use of the innovation, designing practical intervention strategies, and confidently attributing outcomes to the program.

        "description":"The research described in this paper was designed to assess how evaluative data were used in instructional decision making in the Portland (Oregon) Public Schools. Using the Level of Use of an Innovation (LoU) interview, a component of the Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM), along with data from the Portland Achievement Levels Test (PALT), the study assessed the relationship between evaluation use and student achievement, the correlation between high-achieving schools and the frequency and effectiveness of evaluations, and the factors of evaluation that link it with improved school achievement. Thirty-six principals and 82 teachers in grades 3-8 were randomly selected for interview by 9 certified LoU interviewers. The interviews focused on four key components of the use of PALT  evaluative data: (1) the use of student achievement reports; (2) the use of school administrative reports; (3) the role of evaluation reports in decision making; and (4) the decision situations where evaluation reports are used. Results are reported and tabulated for each of the four research questions. The use of evaluation was found to have a significant effect on 93 percent of the 126 teachers and administrators interviewed; these findings suggest that inservice support is needed to develop knowledge and skills in evaluation use, that personality traits may be a factor in movement of individuals to higher levels of use, and that the Level of Use interview technique produces rich descriptive information on how individuals use evaluative data in instructional planning and decision  making.

Six training sessions were developed. As a whole, the sessions help participants understand school organization and its impact on both the change process and field agent behavior. Individually, the sessions focus on different aspects of school organization, the change process, field agent activities, and the interaction among them. The training sessions developed are: (1) school context and school change; (2) site influence on the field agent;  (3) planning and participation; (4) spreading change; (5) promoting lasting change; and (6) getting started. Each session begins with a trainer's overview that identifies the session's purposes, outlines its goals and activity sequence, and provides an estimate of the amount of time that should be devoted to the session's guidelines. Following the overview are the presentations, skill development exercises, and case studies to be used in the sessions. Masters for handouts are provided at the end of each section. (SI)",

Petersen's observations are borne out by John Daresh's research paper, \"The Beginning Principalship: Preservice and Inservice Implications,\" and William Johnson's and Karolyn Snyder's piece, \"Instructional Leadership Training Needs for School Principals.\" They identify principal learning needs for more comprehensive and systematic school  leadership preparation. Vivian Clark's \"The Effectiveness of Case Studies in Training Principals, Using the Deliberative Orientation\" shows a \"hand-on\" case study simulation approach to training principals that conveys the job's sophistication. Bruce Barnett offers another training model in \"Peer-Assisted Leadership: Using Research To Improve Practice.\" Providing principals the opportunity to analyze their own behaviors in cooperation with a partner confronting the same kinds of challenges increases the trainee's reflective processes.

The methodology encompasses problem definition, fact finding, mission management, overcoming inertia, cohering programs tied to theory, feasible goal-setting, and normative personnel re-education. Nine issues influence the planning of program development structure for an entire school system: school system perspective (basic ideology and social beliefs), overall school district mission, personnel inertia (resistance to change), unity of program purposes (coherence), program objectives, program design choices, district norms, quality control, and persistence.

This discussion is divided into three major concerns: sociopolitical, professional, and student. Sociopolitical concerns include the impact of peace, war, human sexuality, environment, work and leisure time, multicultural relations, and economic class relationships on education. Professional concerns involve the dilemmas of curriculum reform, teaching methods, organizational management, decision-making, educational governance, and school-community relations. Student concerns encompass core curriculum relevancy, human capital investment, career choices and counseling, and labor market entry prognostics. That educational  policymakers consider the above concerns when making decisions comprises the conclusion of this treatise. (JAM)",

Methods of co-invention frame the discussion. The work reported in this paper derives from a project of co-invention now in its third year involving Brown University and Hope High School, Providence, Rhode Island. Part one focuses on the Hope High School Project's experimentation with the following methods of co-invention: (1) the use of crisis as a way to crystallize commitment to principles of school reform and curriculum development; and (2) the use of documentation or textmaking as way to keep track of the work  of co-invention. Part 2 centers on two texts actually used by the Hope Project to keep track of curriculum development generated by school crises and student incompletes. The discussion concludes by indicating that textmaking and co-invention are powerful tools to be implemented in school reform endeavors. (JAM)",

The IRQ focuses on school demographics, which resources administrators most commonly use to obtain both general and legal information, and administrator opinions about how well-versed a particular group should be in school law. From a random sample of 75 school superintendents (Ss), 75 secondary school principals (SPs), and 75 elementary school principals (EPs) in the Massachusetts Public Schools, 142 questionnaires were returned from 59 Ss, 40 SPs, and 43 EPs. Four major findings were: (1) newspapers are often read by school administrators; (2) administrators  rely on one another for information; (3) professional organizations at the state level are a more frequent source than are national organizations; and (4) Ss use a wider variety of resources to a greater extent than do principals. The school lawyer was identified as a key person in providing legal knowledge. Pressing issues were teacher evaluation, liability, and special education. Administrators almost unanimously expressed a need for school officials to have some knowledge of education law. The knowledge void existing among administrators is not due to attitudinal indifference. Ten data tables are provided. The IRQ, the cover letter mailed to the study sample, and the followup letter to nonrespondents are appended. (SLD)",

The study found teachers still uncertain about the value of integrating such children into regular classes after 1 year though their beliefs were not always supported by the data comparing the DS children with the contrast children in the areas of time on-task/disruptions, interactions with the teacher, compliance, social interaction, and affectionate behavior and mimicry. There was no support for the commonly held belief that DS  children are socially isolated during unstructured time with some DS children showing a greater range of abilities when interacting with peers in unstructured situations than in the classroom. All of the DS children maintained or surpassed their previous rate of progress after 1 year although teachers gave them much more attention than contrast children. Results suggested that integration of these children can be effective but that the services of an itinerant teacher are valuable and the use of novelty encourages more peer interaction in all children.

Clear definition of the teaching roles of &quot;individual helper,&quot;&quot;activity manager&quot; (who keeps children not being taught individually on task), and &quot;mover&quot; (who maintains flow by obtaining equipment, dealing with interruptions, etc.) are required. Application of the model to a New Zealand classroom of 10- to 11-year-olds using parents as helping  activity managers and individual helpers is described. Comparison of amount of time children were on task when either using parents as general assistants or when using parents following the RM model found significant differences in favor of the RM model.

A 1985 study of the author is summarized in which a training program resulted in commitment by 80% of teachers involved to identify and report child abuse and by 60% of teachers to further educate themselves in child abuse and educate children about child abuse. Teacher knowledge level was increased by providing inservice training. Content of the training program included increasing knowledge of: the definition of child abuse, incidence, causes, treatment, and attitudes. Teachers were encouraged to fulfill their roles to identify, report, support, and educate children who are or might become victims of child abuse. The paper concludes with a listing  of possible signs and symptoms of child abuse and signs and symptoms of parents who might abuse. (DB)",

Twenty mentally retarded adults and 20 nonretarded preschoolers were asked to sequence photographs of events depicted in familiar and novel contexts. Preschoolers were unable to sequence events depicted in novel contexts, suggesting that young children may not possess scripts for the events as depicted. Mentally retarded individuals were better able to sequence events depicted in familiar contexts than in novel contexts, suggesting deficits in generalizing social knowledge. Observations of mentally retarded individuals in naturally occurring events indicated that actual social behavior was unrelated to  event knowledge. (Author/DB)",

Paired support-group facilitators consisted of a successfully employed disabled individual and a professional service provider. The handbook is divided into three major sections. Section One consists of four chapters which focus on planning issues: \"Rationale: Why Set Up a Program?\"; \"Resources: What Is Necessary to Establish a Support Group?\"; \"Target Population: Whom Should the Group Serve?\"; and \"Facilitators:  How Recruit, Train, and Supervise.\" Implementation is the theme of Section Two, which includes the remaining eight chapters: \"Collaboration: How To Interact with School Districts and Agencies\"; \"Recruitment: Where to Find Youth\"; \"Transporation: How to Make Arrangements\"; \"Initial Implementation: How to Get the Group Up and Running\"; \"Interest and Attendance: How Can They Be Maintained?\"; \"Issues and Headaches: How to Solve Problems\"; \"Termination: How to End a Support Group\"; and \"Evaluation: Who Needs To Know How the Group Is Doing?\" Sample forms are included.

        "description":"Although knowledge of multimeaning words is important for reading comprehension, deaf readers may know only the most common meanings or nuances of high-frequency multimeaning words. Results of a study are reported in which 33 profoundly hearing impaired students stratified into three equal age groups (ages 10, 11, and 12) were administered a 60-item pictorial, multimeaning vocabulary test. Each item contained one target word and five possible responses in the form of contextual illustrations. Results indicated that knowing two meanings proved significantly more difficult than knowing one meaning of the same words. Selecting more than one meaning was not influenced by age, suggesting that deaf students may lack not only an in-depth knowledge of words, but also the ability to use  available context clues in deriving word meanings. To enrich vocabulary development, a three-step plan for teaching multimeaning words is described: (1) activate and enrich the students' prior knowledge; (2) develop activities that give students practice in applying newly learned word knowledge; (3) provide opportunities for reading familiar and new words in a wide variety of natural, meaningful contexts. Sample activities are provided to illustrate each step. (JW)",

The review of these practices reveals how, once the philosophy of using aversives takes hold at a program (to deal with seemingly intractable behaviors), its &quot;success&quot; can easily lead to a wider application of an increasing array of aversive techniques to less severe behaviors, without any attempt at more conventional treatment approaches which pose less risk of harm to clients. Recommendations to insure adequate safeguards for clients are offered and include securing the consent of the specific client if competent to provide consent, gaining permission for the use of aversive interventions from  a body external to the facility, and permitting the aversive intervention only after proof of the dangerousness of the targeted behavior and the ineffectiveness of other treatment interventions.

The study found that the annual reporting rate of abuse and neglect in these facilities was more than two times higher than for the state as a whole; it also found widely varying procedures and practices for reporting allegations of child abuse and neglect among different mental health facilities. Investigations of many of the reported abuse and neglect cases did not meet state guidelines. Other findings were that boys, children over 12, and children with conduct disorder diagnoses were high risk victims of child abuse and neglect and that unscheduled time periods and times when no clinical staff were  readily available presented higher risk times for child abuse and neglect. Recommendations are grouped into the following categories: Ensuring the More Accountable Reporting of Allegations; Promoting Accountable and Thorough Investigations of Allegations; Enhancing Prevention Efforts; and Strengthening Oversight of the Reporting, Handling, and Investigation of Allegations. Appendixes provide tabular statistics on the 80 reported allegations, and a response to the draft report by the New York State Office of Mental Health and the New York State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities.

Results revealed that the students believed that their lives were steadily improving, that they were more satisfied than dissatisfied with the quality of their lives, and that they expected to be happier in the future. Students expressed greater satisfaction than their parents perceived they were experiencing. Students' strongest interests were in social activities, followed by physical sports and home management. A greater percentage of parents than students perceived finding a job, managing money, and problem solving as areas of need; a large percentage in both groups  identified filling out forms as a priority. Regardless of educational classification, the students and their parents perceived that the students had the greatest need for development in social/community adaptation and problem-solving skills. Parents were also found to have needs for programming, especially in the area of setting goals for their children and utilizing community resources, while teachers indicated that a number of independent living skill areas were not sufficiently covered in existing curricula.

        "description":"This curriculum emphasizes successful transition from school to work and to a quality adult life for students with mild disabilities. The curriculum includes a scope and sequence outlining 11 subject matter content areas, covering tasks appropriate for learners from a developmental age of 1 month to 21 years. The 11 content areas include psycho-perceptual, early development, basic skills, comprehensive basic skills, essential skills, science, social studies, health/safety, basic living, social/emotional, and career education. Within the subject areas are listed 2,000 objectives for use in individualized education programs or individualized transition plans. A process is presented for aligning the transition curriculum with core curriculum content areas. Many objectives include  references to instructional materials. A computer-searchable set of the curriculum objectives are also available for Apple IIe and IBM PC computers; the curriculum text provides directions on accessing objectives on the diskettes, selecting them for printout, modifying objectives, and adding new objectives. The curriculum was designed so that sections could be used independently; many subcomponents can be modified or replaced to meet users' unique needs. Also described are student activities called \"transition projects,\" which parallel individualized education program goals related to transition and are performed in non-school environments. (JDD)",

This report contains a literature review which outlines recent approaches to addressing quality of life issues, including conceptualizations, methodologies, and ethical concerns. A field inquiry report summarizes the results of interviews conducted among individuals with disabilities. These interviews were conducted with 45 persons, ranging in age from 20 to 50. Eight domains were explored during the interviews, including: environment, employment/occupation, education/training, health, community utilization, personal management, leisure/recreation, and interpersonal relations. Three domains were mentioned repeatedly as areas needing improvement  or contributing to negative experiences/feelings. These three domains were: interpersonal relations, environment, and community utilization. Based on information from the literature review and interviews, a definition of quality adult life is presented as a working model. A copy of the form used to guide the interviews concludes the document. (JDD)",

Subjects were 30 elementary level special education teachers, assigned randomly to a dynamic goal CBA, static goal CBA, or control group for 15 weeks. Two pupils in each class were identified to evaluate the effects of the instructional intervention. In the dynamic goal condition, teachers employed CBA, and (1) modified instructional programs when student progress fell below expectations and (2) increased goals when student progress exceeded expectations. In the static goal condition, teachers employed CBA and modified programs when progress was below expectations, but did not systematically increase goals in response to progress that exceeded anticipated  improvement rates. Multivariate analyses of variance conducted on fidelity of treatment measures indicated that dynamic goal teachers increased goals more frequently and, by the study's completion, employed more ambitious goals. Multivariate analyses of covariance indicated that students in the dynamic goal group had better content mastery than control students, whereas students in the static goal group did not. Content coverage for the three groups was comparable. Implications for instructional goal-setting practice are discussed. (Author/DB)",

The study used data collected in 1982-83 from parent interviews, teacher interviews, and the student's school record. The distribution of estimated per pupil expenditures was examined overall and by primary handicap, by placement, by study site, and by background characteristics. Factors associated with variations in estimated per pupil expenditures were identified. Main findings included: (1) the mean per pupil expenditure for all special education students was approximately twice that of regular students; (2) instruction accounted for 68% of  expenditures, related services for 8%, and indirect services for 24%; (3) expenditures for instruction and related services varied considerably; (4) hearing impaired and physically/multiply handicapped students had higher per pupil expenditures than other groups; (5) within primary handicap groups there was considerable variation in per pupil expenditures for related services; (6) the least restrictive environment was also the least expensive and special classes were the most expensive placement; (7) there was no evidence of bias based on race, socioeconomic status, or gender in the levels of resources provided for instruction.

The UNIQUE Physical Fitness Test was administered to 203 cerebral palsied adolescents throughout the United States and from segregated and nonsegregated educational placements by 53 professional testers. Subjects were also classified on the basis of sport ability classifications used by the Cerebral Palsy International Sport and Recreation Association. A series of three way univariate analyses of covariance were performed utilizing intellectual classification, age, and gender as independent variables and functional ability as the covariate. A series of multiple regression analyses were  also performed and factor analytic solutions were derived. Findings indicated: (1) mild mental retardation was not a significant factor on the physical fitness test performance of individuals with cerebral palsy; (2) the physical fitness factor structures of mildly retarded and nonretarded adolescents with cerebral palsy are virtually identical; and (3) the sport ability classification system was more discriminating in regard to physical fitness performance than the stationary or locomotor classification systems associated with the UNIQUE Physical Fitness Test.

Steps are outlined for completing a program self-study. Then forms are offered for assessing the quality of specific program areas. A section on necessary relationships examines school district interagency cooperation/coordination and staff-parent interactions. A section on eligibility for services focuses on locating and identifying children with suspected handicapping conditions, screening, and assessment. Forms to evaluate program specifics cover program delivery models, therapy delivery models, staff qualifications, and staffing ratios. To assess the program's physical environment, forms are provided for  considering space and equipment, health and safety, and transportation. Forms dealing with staff-child interaction address classroom management and the curriculum's philosophy, organization, strategies, and materials. Evaluation of program administration calls for a review of general procedures, staff development, program evaluation procedures, and staff supervision. Each form lists several elements found in a quality early childhood special education program, along with space for indicating compliance with these elements and for making comments. (JDD)",

The model is built on the assumption that high school programs should be integrated, age-appropriate, community-referenced, future-oriented, comprehensive, effective, and should involve parents. The model defines these values in a way that allows them to be measured and defines target levels of performance. Classroom procedures have been designed to support achievement of those standards. This visitors' packet contains background information about the model, followed by a high school implementation checklist, which focuses on seven areas  of model implementation: student integration; development, monitoring, and updating of individualized education programs; effective instructional design and delivery; placement of students in supported employment; management of classroom tasks and resources; consumer satisfaction with classroom operation and student outcomes; and district policies that support the model. The packet also contains a sample individualized education program, a sample transition plan, definitions of job clusters, vocational training formats, answers to common questions about the Employment Training and Transition Model, and a resource list.

The program provides a comprehensive model of training and support services which link members of the target population to available community training/education programs and services. Project MEAL strategies call for creation of a service delivery model that includes: linkages between  local education agencies and providers of services for learning-disabled adults; provision of educational and vocational career assessment; assistance for clients in developing job readiness skills, specific job skills, and independent living skills; and job placement services. Described in this final report and replication manual are Project MEAL's referral and intake procedures; assessment procedures; curriculum and instructional program; development of Individualized Education, Training, and Employment Plans; tutoring services; financial planning; job development; job tracking; problems encountered while conducting the project; the case management system; and an evaluation of the project's effectiveness.

The study's objective was to determine how language users distinguish the essential from the peripheral information, to describe the summarizing process, and to apply the macrostructure theory to the process of summarizing. The summarized texts and the summaries were compared by &quot;sequences,&quot; or units constructed around a verb. All student summaries were based on a single original text, while each expert summary was based on a different text. Sequences were categorized as parallel, parallel-selective, selective, selective-generalizing, integrating, or commentary. Common traits of the student summaries were distinguished. Few differences between student and expert summaries were  found, the most salient being the more common use of integrating sequences in expert summaries. The summarizing process is described thus: the summarizer selects some sequences that are kept more or less intact, deletes one or several sequences, sometimes generalizes, and sometimes comments. The sequence analysis is proposed as a basis for semantic analysis, as suggested by the notion of macrostructure. (MSE)",

They were asked to get an unfamiliar item, one of nine swatches of different colors, shapes, and materials. In the first group, the children were told only one label (color, shape, or material), and in the other three groups, the objects were identified by a novel word contrasted with two familiar words from the same semantic domain (e.g., &quot;it's not yellow, it's not green; it's mauve&quot;). Five tests (sorting, hyponym, color identification, material identification, and shape identification tasks) were then administered to discover what the children thought their new words meant. Results suggested that some of the novel  words introduced corresponded to concepts the children already had names for (e.g., &quot;green&quot; to identify &quot;chartreuse&quot;). It was concluded that children may deal with new information in word learning by making the most of whatever information seems to make sense, given their prior knowledge and beliefs, while quickly ignoring or forgetting the rest.

In this experiment, the children accurately judged an object's size according to a stored mental (normative) standard and also made accurate perceptual judgments when presented with a comparison. No age differences were found. The second experiment set up a conflict between normative and functional standards and required each child to judge an object's size both by itself and in relation to a particular function (use by dolls of  different sizes). Children in all age groups performed above the chance level, and performance improved with age. In addition, children of all ages judged the size of the doll's clothing more accurately than tools for the dolls' use. (MSE)",

It is proposed that the source of complexity in grammatical constructions for the primitive rule usage group is not a function of an overriding primitive rule, but is in the children's capacity to retreat to their syntactically sanctioned causative analysis in experimental contexts. This finding obscures the understanding of what these children really know about the complement structure of the adjectives in question.

        "description":"A study examined use of passive and antipassive constructions in the spontaneous utterances and picture comprehension responses of young speakers of Quiche Mayan, aged 1-5. This usage was compared with use of similar constructions in English-speaking children. Quiche-speakers' usage was found to be precocious in comparison with English-speakers' usage in three senses: (1) Quiche children use non-active sentences much more frequently in daily conversations, reflecting the high frequency of these sentences in adult Quiche and suggesting that there is nothing inherently more difficult about these constructions; (2) Quiche children show early symmetry in their acquisition of the passive and antipassive voices, directly contradicting acquisition theories that appeal to canonical  linking rules and noun-phrase-movement to explain late acquisition of passives in English; and (3) Quiche children are precocious in their production and comprehension of nonactional verbs in nonactive voices, perhaps reflecting a little-understood aspect of the structure of the adult language.

        "description":"Three experiments investigated the processes by which 2-year-olds acquire the language to express category hierarchies. The first experiment studied how children use current linguistic knowledge to constrain the potential meanings of new words. This experiment compared interpretations of new words given to objects the children could already name with their interpretations of new words given to novel objects. In the second experiment, the children were taught new words for familiar objects, with the objective of learning why children use a new word for a known object to apply only to the object explicitly named. The third experiment further explored the results of the second, investigating whether children interpreted a new word for a familiar object as a subordinate or  contrasting basic category in comparison with known words. The experiments demonstrated that 2-year-old children interpret a new word differently depending on whether they already know a word for the object being named. In addition, the results suggest that 2-year-olds interpret a new noun applied to a familiar object as a subordinate category term, a surprising result because older children have been found to have difficulty with hierarchical relations.

This approach treats language acquisition as a process of change. It is suggested that it is possible, from existing data on child language, to arrive at general operating principles for language acquisition, or strategies for language construction, along with a characterization of the child's natural and growing organization of semantic and phonological space and basic syntactic principles. Recent research in this area has accounted for the development of morphological paradigms, canonical sentence forms, placement of  operators, and various patterns of over- and underextension of meaning. Research on grammatical morphemes is providing evidence that linguistic forms and constructions have a long developmental history closely tied to discourse functions. Attention to the mutual relationship between form and function is seen as essential to understanding both child language and historical language change. (MSE)",

Functionalism is defined as the belief that the forms of natural languages are created, governed, constrained, acquired, and used for communicative functions. Functionalism is viewed as the natural alternative to language theories that postulate the separation of structure and function or describe structural facts without reference to communicative goals or the capabilities of human information processing. These six misconceptions are addressed, then replaced with more viable functionalist accounts: (1) grammars reflect the interaction between cognitive content and cognitive processes; (2) symbolic and  indexical relations exist between form and function; (3) mappings between form and function are many-to-many; (4) grammatical mappings are inherently probabilistic; (5) functionalism is biologically plausible; and (6) functionalist claims are made at different levels.

Six theoretically derived theses on acquisition are presented and discussed: (1) the concept of language changes as new data come to light; (2) the crucial question for acquisition is not how the child learns which expressions are syntactically grammatical, but rather which interpretations he excludes; (3) the child cannot receive significant negative  evidence; (4) input information is contradictory; (5) subset violations show where principles apply; and (6) change in grammar over time occurs because an item is either ambiguous or parametrically contingent.

Two large groups of volunteers, college students of Spanish and Japanese, completed attitude and study strategy questionnaires and took initial language skill tests, and those who persisted for one year were  re-administered the proficiency tests. Exam scores and course grades were collected for each quarter. Analysis of the data indicated that certain study strategies were consistently associated with academic success, although some differences were found for Spanish and Japanese.

For both groups of students, the classroom was seen as the most relevant context for language learning. Specific classroom behaviors demonstrating cognitive rehearsal, such as repeating new forms and taking notes, were positively associated with achievement. Selected individual behavior items (such as socializing with second language speakers, not being afraid to use the new language, and seeking exposure to the new language through media) enhanced second language proficiency. The only differences between persistent and non-persistent students were in two areas. In  Spanish, the persistent students saw themselves as more interactive than the non-persistent, whereas in Japanese, the persistent students had more positive initial attitudes toward language study. It is concluded that progress and persistence in elementary foreign language study are shaped by several influences.

Results helped to establish patterns of language dominance in the bilinguals and to define different aspects of language proficiency in terms of semantic functioning (i.e., defining words and understanding relationships between words) and communicative competence in everyday activities. It was found that when tested in their weaker language, bilingual  children fell behind in basic reading ability and, in the case of early reading in English, group differences were more related to differences in language proficiency and lack of formal English instruction than to differences in cognitive ability and home experience. Results also show that Spanish monolinguals acquire some proficiency in English but at levels below those of other groups. A list of 27 references is included. (Author/MSE)",

Translation (1) encourages thinking in one language and transferring to another, with accompanying interference; (2) deprives teacher and learner of the benefit of working within a single language; (3) gives false credence to the idea that there is a perfect one-to-one correspondence between languages; and (4) does not facilitate achievement of generally accepted aims such as spoken language emphasis, controlled introduction and mastery of graded structures and lexicon, situationalized language, communicative language use, learner-centered instruction, and  seeing different world views. Grading translations is also difficult and contains some pitfalls. Careful text selection is seen as critical to good translation instruction, and can be guided by a few simple considerations. Several classroom techniques have been found to be successful, including: oral translation drills; random selected translation of parts of a text; translation of short, varied passages rather than one long passage; group translation work; and work on common translation problems.

One purpose of the study is to adapt to this university the Commission on Higher Education and the Adult Learner's &quot;Postsecondary Education Institutions and the Adult Learner: A Self-Study Assessment and Planning Guide,&quot; which reports 200 practices effective in the education of adults. Instruments incorporating modifications from the literature and suggestions of earlier &quot;Guide&quot; users were sent to all department and division heads, samples of faculty and academic advisors, and heads of the Division of Continuing Education (DCE) and University Without Walls (UWW).  Support-service heads were interviewed via Guide-based protocols. Measures of &quot;climate&quot; for potential adoption were calculated. Measures of adult-student satisfaction with services and environment were sought via the Student Opinion Survey, sent to 181 adult undergraduates in adult-degree programs and traditional majors. The response rate overall was in excess of 80%. Many practices were in use in DCE and UWW. Elsewhere, nominal acceptance was moderately widespread; usage lagged far behind. Advisors were identified as the most responsive personnel group, Education and Health Sciences the most responsive academic units. Results indicate that the university is somewhat responsive now but potentially very responsive, and an attitude change is needed. Recommendations include having the  university build on demonstrated and potential strengths, establishing an Office of Adult Learning Services as a clearinghouse for information on available options to adult students, investigating the possibility of expanding the number and nature of academic-department courses offered after 4:00 P.M., tracing the pattern of independent study credit to see how extensively part-time students are using it, and scheduling a conference on the general topic of this dissertation.

Various methodological and technical issues that are encountered in practice are noted, and questions are raised about improvements in the quality of economic education in Turkey, even though the number of faculty members of economic studies has increased. It is noted that the progress of economics as a social science in Turkey has been historically delayed and is a dependent one. A general evaluation of the traditional theory of economics is given to help assess the  content of Turkish economic education. Three main points to address when organizing programs of economic education in Turkey are: (1) the Turkish economy should be considered and analyzed with particular attention; (2) the Turkish economy and the entire science of economics must be analyzed from an historical perspective; and (3) abstract mathematical analysis should be utilized only in so far as it does not veil the actual economic problems of Turkey. Some of the factors limiting the quality of economic education in Turkey are the crowded classrooms, lack of well-written textbooks, insufficient research, and outdated instructional methods. (SM)",

        "description":"All institutions of higher education receive support from different combinations of patrons holding different expectations about the rewards of their patronage. In fact, much of what goes on in colleges and universities is the result of accommodation of the interests of governmental, industrial, and philanthropic patrons mediated through the professional filters of faculties and administrations. Moreover, patterns of patronage have changed over time, from the early influence of organized religion to the more recent enlarged role of the national government. The continued patronage of the private sector is virtually unique in American higher education. Private sector patronage in this century has been fueled by income tax laws and the financial advantages of charitable deductions.  The motives and methods of private-sector patrons continue to be issues of concern. The federal government has become, and will remain, the dominant patron for research universities. However, the federal government is not, in any meaningful sense, a partner with universities, despite the rhetoric of government-university relations. As social needs change, the priorities of a democratic government change, sharply limiting the ability of that government to make continuing commitments. In addition, for the past 20 years, federal patronage has been of the \"purchase order\" variety, with virtually no investment in the physical infrastructure of research and uneven investments in replenishing the human resource base. Government patronage can transform scientific decisions into economic and then  political decisions. The recent trend toward congressional earmarking of funds for scientific facilities and research undermines the system of competition and merit review. (KM)",

These data are compared with 44 other academic disciplines/major fields. Since 1982-83, the College and University Personnel Association (CUPA) in Washington, D.C. with Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina has conducted annual national faculty salary studies by discipline and rank through 1987-88. Salary data were collected and tabulated for full-time teaching faculty in 45 academic disciplines including accounting. Besides listing average salaries in accounting for both public and private institutions by rank and listing faculty mix percentage and salary factor, comparisons are  made between the two studies for each of the 2 study years and with the Consumer Price Index CPI) of changes in cost of living. Study results include: the average faculty salary in accounting is now 12% and 8% above the overall average faculty salary of the other 44 fields for public and private studies respectively; the October 1987 CPI compared to the October 1984 CPI indicates accounting faculty in public and private institutions received salary increases for three years above the cost of living; and there is a good percentage increase of new assistant professors being hired in public institutions but a decline in private ones.

        "description":"CMS (Computer Mail System) School-Net is an informal, grass-roots telecommunications network developed by the San Diego (California) School District to provide assistance in improving student language and communications skills. Each CMS electronic bulletin board represents a node in the network, which operates independently during the day as a fairly normal-looking electronic bulletin board program. However, two features make it unique among electronic bulletin boards: it allows students to send lengthy files to their correspondents, and, in the middle of the night, all of the CMS nodes in the network dial each other up and exchange e-mail, permitting a teacher in San Diego to send a batch of student writing to a teacher in any of 25 or 30 other places. The primary function of  the network is to transmit student writing from one place to another, thereby providing real audiences and real purposes to motivate student writing. This paper includes suggestions for creating a CMS School-Net as well as technical details of the system and descriptions of several projects that have been completed on the San Diego CMS School-Net. An editor's update notes that the network is expanding, despite threatened budget cutbacks and budget restrictions that have forestalled program evaluations. (EW)",

CBET uses a computer network to send messages rather than an ordinary telephone call, and MMN is a technique for transferring messages, data, and images between electronically incompatible systems. Both systems are used in an asynchronous manner, whereby sender and receiver need not exchange information at the same time, and in a synchronous manner which is both immediate and interactive. A CBET project in Hawaii is the Hawaii Global TELEclass project, which has involved Hawaiian students in foreign language exchanges with students from Japan, as well as in other foreign language exchanges in Hawaii.  As TELEclass continues into its third year, exchanges involving other languages and other subject fields are under consideration. The TELEclass experience also provides information about the establishment of a telecommunications program that can be transferred to other similar programs. (EW)",

        "description":"This paper provides commentary on some of the issues and projects considered in other papers presented at the conference, focusing in particular on some of the nontechnological issues associated with the design, development, and implementation of telecomputing and networking in education. Four types of telecomputing projects are considered: national telecomputing projects, statewide networks, local or community-based networks, and hybrid interactive distance learning projects. It is suggested that the major challenges in these four areas are political and economic, and that the high turnover rate of individuals involved in such projects is due to these political and economic issues, as well as to the volatile nature of telecomputing and networking ventures in education. The fact  that half of the authors who presented papers at the conference in September 1986 are no longer officially involved in the projects they described is cited as an example of this instability. It is argued that if the potential of telecomputing, distance learning, and other projects is to be realized, these problems must be addressed at various policy levels. (EW)",

A mathematics-oriented computer-assisted instruction (CAI) program with an embedded general problem-solving strategy was developed. A related computer-managed instruction (CMI) module maintained student progress and phased out the problem-solving assistance as students became more skilled at solving problems. Effectiveness was evaluated by pre- and post-tests and questionnaires administered to 37 students who used the CAI program and a control group of 23 students who received no CAI. Improvement in the mean test scores of the group using CAI was approximately twice that of the control group, and responses to the questionnaire showed that the students in the experimental group  enjoyed using the CAI program and felt that they learned from it.

Copies of the diskettes were distributed at the 1988 Florida Instructional Computing Conference and were mailed to prospective applicants for the computer-based graduate programs. An evaluative questionnaire was completed by academic officials of the university, one academic official from another university, and colleagues. The results of the formal evaluation showed a favorable reaction to the new media approach, with respondents describing the diskettes as professional in quality, concise, attractive, and appropriate for their intended use.  Several participants indicated that they would now consider initiating a similar project for their own institution. Nine appendixes include print-outs of the hardcopy listing and the color and monochrome screens for the diskette, flowcharts of the screen sequence, and a copy of the survey instrument.

        "description":"This paper compares two alternative computer architectures that have been proposed to provide the control mechanism that enables an intelligent tutoring system to decide what instructional action to perform next, i.e., discourse management networks and blackboards. The claim that an intelligent tutoring system controlled by a blackboard architecture can deliver significantly more effective and flexible instruction than one controlled by a discourse management network is supported by considering an architectural formalization of each architecture and the way in which its key components facilitate or hamper the dynamic planning of instruction. The relationship between this ability to plan instruction dynamically and to generate effective and flexible instruction is also supported.  To ground these discussions, two examples of each architecture are provided: GUIDON and MENO-TUTOR exemplify discourse planners implemented as discourse management networks, while IDE-INTERPRETER and the BLACKBOARD INSTRUCTIONAL PLANNER exemplify planners implemented in the blackboard architecture. Application of each architecture to control an intelligent tutoring system to teach LISP is also considered to further illustrate differences in capability that result from choice of architecture. The text is supplemented by 7 figures, and a 13-item bibliography is provided. (EW)",

Discussion of the computer programming component includes two of the LOGO problem sets, which compare a priori and a posteriori reasoning, one at the beginning and one at the intermediate level. It is noted that a problem is presented at each level, the LOGO skills necessary to approach the problem are provided, and a guided interaction between the teacher and the student occurs. The two major techniques used to teach collaborative problem-solving are then discussed, i.e., the use of projects that facilitate collaborative  learning via top-down design and the Whimbey and Lochhead's &quot;Problem Solving and Comprehension&quot; (1986). The types of writing assignments required by the course are also described, and a summary of the results achieved in teaching the course over the past five years concludes the report.

        "description":"Two self-contained fourth grade classrooms were compared during a 1-year study conducted in a small rural community in Indiana. Pre-test measures consisted of the previous year's third grade scores on the Cognitive Abilities test and a self-developed inventory of attitude toward school and computers. The control group (n=28) received instruction throughout the study via traditional teaching methods with one computer available to the class. The experimental group (n=29), with a student/computer ratio of 2:1, began the year by learning keyboarding and becoming familiar with the computer system and the available variety of software, as well as attending to the traditional lessons with their teacher. After this initial instruction, these students spent a minimum of two hours per day  at the computer, either alone, or with a partner, working with software from all areas of typical daily instruction. The measures of posttest performance for the two groups compared computer skills mastered; problem solving ability; and the Iowa Test of Basic Skills Reading, Math, and Composite Subtests. Both the raw scores on these measures and the scores adjusted for differences in intelligence were compared. Student attitudes toward school and computers, and teacher perceptions of student abilities were also compared. Although the experimental group had significantly higher scores on the computer skills test, none of the other measures produced significant results. Five appendixes and two supplemental analyses provide the study data and statistical analyses, sample measuring  instruments, and a list of computer skills objectives. Ten references are included.

        "description":"The need for colleges to develop critical thinking skills in mainstream courses is emerging as an issue of national significance. Students benefit from clearly articulated and pedagogically sound courses that directly and explicitly teach thinking skills, as well as from efforts to reinforce these abilities across the curriculum. At LaGuardia Community College (LCC) in New York, the thinking skills program began with a course entitled &quot;Critical Thought Skills,&quot; which seeks to develop students' writing, reading, and speaking skills; address basic thinking, reasoning, and problem-solving skills; and encourage students to explore their attitudes toward life and education. For the past four years, one section of the course has been paired with other courses selected from a variety of  disciplines. The intellectual abilities taught in &quot;Critical Thought Skills&quot; are reinforced as the content of the two courses is integrated. Students enrolled in &quot;Critical Thought Skills&quot; paired with writing and reading courses have developed language skills at accelerated rates, through substantive writing assignments, critical evaluation of challenging readings, and thoughtful discussion. The pedagogical focus of the program stresses the relationship between what students are learning and their own experiences, building systematically from concrete, familiar contexts to more abstract, conceptual understandings. Thinking skills are taught through a process of synthesis, giving students the means to clarify and make sense of themselves and the world in which they live. The final elements  in LCC's critical thinking program are faculty development, collaboration, and ownership of the program. (AJL)",

        "description":"The discipline cost analysis system for Maryland's community colleges yields information on costs per course, costs per student credit hour, and costs per full-time equivalent student for each intellectual discipline. Costs are assigned to individual course sections and then amalgamated at the discipline level. Total cost figures are the sum of faculty compensation, additional direct instructional costs, and indirect or overhead costs. Three factors account for much of the variation among disciplines: average class size, full-time/part-time faculty ratio, and faculty rank. In fiscal year (FY) 1988, the following figures were calculated for Prince George's Community College (PGCC): (1) the overall cost per full-time equivalent student was $3,096, down 0.7% from FY 1987; (2) for  credit courses, the average cost was $3,302, while for noncredit courses the average was $2,603; (3) general education courses in the arts and sciences continued to be more expensive than occupational or continuing education instruction; (4) the disciplines with the highest per student costs were all in health technology; (5) PGCC's costs per student in credit classes were less than both the statewide average and averages for the six largest Maryland community colleges; and (6) adjusting for inflation, PGCC's cost per student in 1987 was less than that of 1980.

The first document, &quot;Meeting the Future,&quot; offers background information on LCC, presents a rationale for strategic planning, and explains LCC's use of environmental and internal scans to gather the information necessary to develop realistic plans. The booklet explains that data for the environmental scan was collected through interviews, meetings, and telephone or written surveys, focusing on demographic, government, social, cultural, and other trends. It also reviews the scope and methods of the internal scan, which used information from surveys, interviews, and meetings with  faculty in 37 programs of study to assess strengths and weaknesses. Finally, the booklet outlines plans regarding the enhancement of equity of educational opportunity, the provision of quality programs, the identification of educational needs, and the improvement of relationships with the community. The remaining documents in the collection include: (1) a summary of the methods and findings of the internal scan; (2) action statements related to LCC's strategic choices; (3) a summary of planning highlights; (4) an enumeration of the steps in the planning process; (5) a report on the environmental scan; and (6) an outline of procedures for program evaluation.

        "description":"When a discipline enters the lock-out mode in the San Jose/Evergreen Community College District, the computer prevents a student from registering in any course in that discipline unless he/she has completed all prerequisites for that course. To determine how this registration process affected enrollments, average daily attendance (ADA) figures were calculated for seven disciplines for the semesters before and after the disciplines entered the lock-out mode. The disciplines were Art, Computer Technology, Electronics, English, English as a Second Language (ESL), Laser, and Math. Study findings included the following: (1) Art ADA increased by 29.63% between fall 1986 and 1987; (2) Computer Technology, Laser, and Electronics entered the lock-out mode during a long-term decline in the  local electronics industry, which may have been a contributing factor to the more than 25% declines in ADA in Computer Technology and Laser following lock-out; (3) during the first semester of lock-out, English experienced a decline of 7.62, paralleling the District's overall 7.91% ADA decline; (4) English and ESL recovered their drop in ADA during the second semester of lock out; (5) ESL decreased 15.32% from spring 1986 to spring 1987, during a complete revision of the ESL program in which class size was reduced and the number of units reduced for some courses; and (6) Math increased 6% in ADA from fall 1986 to fall 1987. The study suggested that it was possible to enforce prerequisites without major and permanent decline in ADA. Much of the data is presented in chart and graph form.  (AJL)",

        "description":"In the San Jose/Evergreen Community College District, course and basic skills prerequisites have been established for all courses. Students who do not have a record of having completed these prerequisites cannot enroll unless they have been assessed by a counselor, have had their prerequisites verified in alternate ways, and have been granted override status for enrollment. In spring 1988, 6,261 overrides were granted based on completion of equivalent coursework, instructor evaluations, life experience, previous degrees, and other reasons. A study was conducted to compare the academic success of students who had completed all course and basic skills prerequisites with that of students who had enrolled on override status. Study findings included the following: (1) 65% of the  students who had completed all course and basic skills prerequisites (N=38,583) received an A, B, C, or CR grade, compared to 57% of those who entered on override status; (2) 67% of the students who were granted override status on the basis of life experience received a C or higher, as did 60% of those who documented completion of previous coursework and 59% of those with previous degrees; (3) the greatest proportion of A and B grades were achieved by students with an override based on life experience, while students who were granted override on the basis of their word that the prerequisite was satisfied had the lowest success rate; and (4) the counselor with the highest percentage of successful students among his/her students (81%) used strictly life experience overrides. Study findings  supported the conclusion that counselors who strictly enforce prerequisites, evaluate relevant life experiences, and use documented evidence of previous course work can place students effectively.

        "description":"A study was conducted at Lakeshore Technical College (LTC) to assess the relationship between students' overall ratings of their instructors and their ratings of particular aspects of their courses. The study sample included 262 first-year students enrolled in at least one general education course and one occupational course in fall 1986. Students were asked to evaluate the course in terms of its difficulty, out-of-class preparation requirements, the grade they expected to receive, usefulness of course information, its planning and organization, presentation of subject matter, assignments, exams, textbooks, instructional materials, and bias. In addition, students were asked to evaluate the instructor in terms of knowledge of subject matter, clarity, enthusiasm, use of class time,  encouragement of student participation, feedback, and interaction with students. Study findings included the following: (1) significant differences in students' overall ratings of instructors were found between male and female students; (2) student ratings of instructor knowledge of subject seemed to be independent of other items; and (3) 5 of 29 items were significantly related to overall instructor evaluation (i.e., &quot;instructor spoke in a way that helped me learn&quot;; &quot;course was well planned and organized&quot;; &quot;instructor encouraged thinking, problem solving, and decision making&quot;; &quot;instructor explained materials clearly&quot;; and &quot;instructor demonstrated interest in my learning&quot;). Based on study findings, recommendations for modifying instructor evaluations were developed. The report includes  117 references and the instructor evaluation form. (AAZC)",

        "description":"Drawing from information submitted by 60 urban, rural, and suburban institutions, this report documents the progress of California's community colleges in implementing the first phase of a statewide matriculation plan. Introductory material defines matriculation as a process that promotes and sustains the efforts of students to reach their educational goals by providing a program of support services. After examining the public policy context of the development of the plan, the report offers a summary of first-year efforts and presents findings concerning the implementation of various components of the matriculation plan at the 60 responding colleges. Progress is examined for the following activities: admissions, orientation, student assessment and placement, counseling, student  follow-up, coordination and staff training, and institutional research and evaluation. Selected findings include the following: (1) during the 10-month funding period, 40% of the students who enrolled in credit courses at the colleges received core matriculation services; (2) 40% of the colleges had developed or revised admissions forms to gather matriculation-related data; (3) 28% had developed orientation materials; (4) colleges were exempting students from the matriculation process on a number of bases, including prior educational experience and types of courses or unit load; and (5) at 69% of the colleges, assessment was mandatory for non-exempt students. Data on funding and expenditures in 1987-88 are also provided. Appendixes include a review of the college progress reports by an  external agency and the matriculation plan. (AACZ)",

The university governing boards and the Illinois Community College Board (ICCB) have since been required to periodically report and assess their efforts to enhance participation at their institutions. In October 1987, the Illinois community colleges reported on their plans and goals. A year later, the colleges were asked to provide the ICCB with an update, including information on how they are evaluating or plan to evaluate their progress, as well as on any results of their evaluation efforts. Responses from 38 of the colleges indicated that each district had not only implemented the  plans and goals established in 1987, but had also established evaluation methods. Several colleges have implemented activities that are applicable to all three target groups, including the development of systems to track student progress and the preparation of policy statements. Programs to improve the participation and success of minority students included efforts to help high school students in planning for college and the establishment of high risk identification and intervention programs. Since the participation and success of female students was not a problem in the colleges, most efforts were directed at improving services for special segments of the female population. Activities to enhance the participation of handicapped students included efforts to ensure access to facilities,  the development of access guides for handicapped students, and cooperative arrangements with outside agencies and high schools. The progress report provides brief descriptions of the activities at each responding college. (AJL)",

These efforts include a range of approaches from those focusing primarily on motivating students and strengthening their academic skills to those involving minority families and the local community. Several features are incorporated in these programs in varying degrees: (1) the programs involve regular college faculty; (2) they create a positive, academic environment through mentoring and peer counseling; (3) they depend on a positive relationship between the college and minority community; (4) they emphasize continuous collaboration with elementary/secondary  schools and four-year institutions; (5) they receive support and promotion from college leadership; and (6) they are organized as a unit in order to provide a package of services and activities needed by minority students. Since community colleges provide access to the majority of Black and Hispanic students enrolling in higher education in Illinois, it is critical that these colleges develop and implement programs designed to enhance student participation, retention, and success.

        "description":"Discussed are three issues in early childhood education that have been addressed extensively by the research literature, namely: (1) the risks of early academic pressures on young children; (2) the importance of play in early childhood education; and (3) interaction as the context for early learning. Several reasons that child development and early learning theory and research are not being applied in early education programs are examined. These reasons seem to be economic, political, and social; philosophical; practical; and emotional. Some suggestions for bridging the gap between theory and research on the one hand and practice on the other are offered. It is concluded that educational programs for young children, whether in nursery schools, day care centers, or public schools,  could be much better than they are if attention were paid to what research has to say. However, efforts to bring research and practice together in early childhood education have been going on for 15 years to little avail. It is time to change this situation. Eighty references are listed. (RH)",

Substantial sections of the report offer information on the background and need for legislation, an explanation of the bill, information on the cost of the legislation, and a section-by-section analysis.

        "description":"In response to community concern about developmental effects on children who play with toys that portray antisocial, violent, or militaristic themes, two government committees were set up to investigate the issue. Psychologists have argued that playing with such toys may increase antisocial and aggressive behavior in children and have long-term effects on children's development of attitudes towards others and towards society in general. A review of research on children's play shows that there is little evidence to support such arguments. Reasons for lack of research are discussed in terms of: (1) problems of establishing criteria for defining 'antisocial,''violent,' and 'war toys'; (2) failure to collect and evaluate anecdotal evidence from parents, teachers, and clinicians  about the toys; and (3) inappropriate argumentative use of evidence from research into effects on children of violent television programs. Problems associated with play research in general include: (1) difficulties in attributing motives to observable play behavior; (2) the likelihood the children's spontaneous play will be suppressed in an experimental situation; and (3) age and sociocultural differences in the significance of certain games and play behaviors in childhood. It is maintained that even without specific research, a case for negative consequences can be made. (RH)",

        "description":"Public concern about day care now focuses on infants and toddlers who began receiving out-of-home care before they had established attachments to their parents. In 1987, public conscience was inflamed by a series of reports in the popular media and the professional literature that underscored potential risks inherent in out-of-home care intiated when children were at an early age. It is maintained that the conclusions of these reports are not justified. Numerous problems in the reports resulted from researchers relying primarily on the Strange Situation to assess effects of infant day care. There is a great deal of variation in the choice of background variables used to define the day care experience. There is also great variability in the manner in which &quot;extent of care&quot; is  defined. Furthermore, researchers do not always include measures of the quality of care received. Despite two decades of intensive research, the effects of day care remain poorly understood. However, a few simple questions can be answered with confidence. Nonparental care experiences need not have harmful effects on children's development. Quality of care and amount of weekly nonparental care appear to be important influences. It is hoped that the current wave of research on day care will yield clearer conclusions than that of the last 20 years. (RH)",

Discussion focuses on mixed backgrounds, the need for and use of appropriate labels, the multiplex heritage of biracial children, their genetic heritage, society's definition of biracial children, myths about interracial parents and their children, ways of supporting biracial children in the early childhood school setting, teachers' support of biracial children, and 13 specific school and classroom activities to be used with biracial children. Educators need to be responsive to the identity needs of biracial  children, and the special needs of their parents. Difficulties that hinder educators' abilities to respond to biracial children are described.

The study examined the effects of manipulation of the severity of consequences in moral dilemmas on the resulting moral judgments of adults. It was hypothesized that adults sometimes make moral judgments based on the outcome of a situation, rather than the actor's intent. It was expected that actors in stories with more severe outcomes would be evaluated more harshly than actors in stories with less severe outcomes. Subjects were 61 undergraduate students. Another 58 undergraduates ranked the stories for severity of outcome. Demographic  data and subjects' responses to five short dilemma stories were obtained. Subjects used a 7-point rating scale to respond to six opinion statements designed to measure perceptions of the actor's responsibility for an accident, intelligence, goodness or badness, carelessness, concern for others, and ability to foresee the accident. Findings indicated that consequences can affect moral judgments, with more severe consequences resulting in more negative judgments. Results also showed that intent is taken into consideration when judgments are made. Findings present difficulties for Kohlberg's conception of stage homogeneity and are more consistent with Piaget's original views of stage homogeneity in moral development. (RH)",

Data suggest that even though overall significant results between training and control groups were not obtained, the program was successful. The number of gain scores favored the training  groups and indicated that behaviors, attitudes, and knowledge could be positively influenced by training. Providers expressed appreciation for the training opportunity. Providers' feelings of competence were enhanced, and provider-child interactions improved.

        "description":"This selective review of literature presents research and theory in support of the proposition that language is an essential component of early artistic development, and is crucial to the nature and nurture of visual expression. Young children frequently accompany drawing activities with descriptive, reflective, and social conversation, verbally monitoring, supplementing, and sharing the progress of their marks. In this paper, four themes are discussed: (1) the role of talk in the transition from the nonrepresentational exuberance of early scribbles (marking) to the intentional symbolization of objects and events (drawing); (2) the impact of adult presence and involvement on the drawing processes of young children; (3) the possibility that young children exhibit particular styles  of talking about their art; and (4) the recommendations offered by researchers and theorists concerning ways to engage children in dialogue about their art. The review proposes the encouragement of young children's natural tendency to talk about the process of making art as a foundation for teaching art in the early years. Adults' efforts to understand the nature of children's art and further children's development would benefit from recognizing and joining in the dialogue through which children name, ponder, initiate, and pursue the creation of visual form.

        "description":"Intended as a basis for student discussions on American Indian issues, this article provides background on American Indian and Alaskan Native spiritual values and the white man's disruption of the Sacred Circle of Life. The foundation of the philosophies of North American indigenous peoples was the idea of cyclical reaffirmation and the goal of maintaining a harmonious balance with nature. Traditional Indian activities were conducted with the circle in mind, reflecting the belief that the power of the world and nature worked in circles. Native societies were cooperative and depended on each facet of the environment for sustenance. Plants and animals were accorded equal value with humans, a view that made large scale exploitation impossible. The whiteman broke the Sacred Circle  and placed the Indians in &quot;boxes&quot; with restrictions that prevented the traditional life and caused a loss of spiritual power. In this regard, the most serious of the white man's actions was the formation of the reservation system, an alternative to genocide. Land was a spiritual ingredient of Indian cultures; removal to the reservation broke the Indians' ties to sacred ancestral lands and led to spiritual and cultural disintegration. Warfare, disease, alcohol, missionary zeal, the 1887 Allotment Act, and removal of children to government schools contributed to the destruction. Today, Native Americans retain their reverence for the land and seek to strengthen the reservation and village, as the only land base left to them. This article contains many quotes from historical and contemporary  Native American leaders, a vocabulary list, and study questions. (SV)",

In 1986, the Indian Health Service (IHS) surveyed Bureau of Indian Affairs schools, public schools with large Indian enrollments, and community groups involved in 225 IHS-funded alcohol and substance abuse programs. Of 420 schools responding, 178 used a topical approach to alcohol/substance abuse education, while 86 were involved in one of five specific model programs; these 264 programs had 57,276 student participants on a predominantly weekly format. Program content most frequently included decision making, peer pressure, values clarification, physical and emotional effects of alcohol and substance abuse, and self-awareness and culture  identity issues. Intervention activities focused on referral for counseling, psychological enrichment activities, and workshop/training. Observation of student and followup was the most frequently reported evaluation technique. Positive outcomes included increased self-esteem in 104 schools, and decreased disciplinary problems, increased attendance, and reduced substance abuse in about 60 schools each. Of 160 community programs responding, 137 targeted adolescents. Virtually all used topical materials plus one or more model programs; total participants numbered 31,946. Discussion and recommendations accompany each of 12 school and 11 community data tables. The report contains 53 references, data on Indian adolescent alcohol and substance abuse, IHS alcoholism and substance abuse  objectives for 1995, brief descriptions of seven model programs, related mortality data, and the survey instrument.

A review of the literature examined (1) problems of culturally disadvantaged students entering college; (2) skills and courses required as adequate preparation for college; (3) the status of Alaska's rural schools in meeting standards of adequate preparation; and (4) strategies used in existing programs to help minority students make the transition to college. Questionnaires, telephone interviews, and a  literature search collected data on 41 preparatory programs at 33 colleges and universities. The case study focused on the following features of the program: (1) preprogram assessment of student data; (2) diagnostic tests administered during orientation and used for course placement; (3) courses and academic, social, and recreational activities offered; (4) methods of course delivery; and (5) methods of course and program evaluation. Prelude staff and faculty analyzed the data and recommended procedures to implement their program. The report contains 67 references. It also includes appendices that provide a map of Alaska showing regions served by Prelude; the letter and questionnaire used to solicit research data; and Prelude's preprogram student assessment, recommendation, and diagnostic  forms; and postprogram evaluation forms.

        "description":"Dramatic demographic and socioeconomic shifts have occurred in rural areas over the last decade, increasing poverty among America's rural population. Analysis of the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey indicates that outmigration from rural areas, which has grown steadily since 1980, reached almost 1,000,000 between 1986 to 1987. Those leaving in the largest numbers were young adults and the better educated, people most needed to revitalize rural economies. Between 1979 and 1986, real median family income fell by 10% in rural areas and less than 1% in urban areas. In 1986 rural unemployment exceeded urban unemployment by 26%, and the rural poverty rate was 18%, 50% higher than the urban rate. Hardest hit have been young adults and their children; a quarter of rural children  were living in poverty in 1986. About 62% of poor rural adults and 54% of poor urban adults, aged 18 to 44, held a job at least part of 1986. Most of the rural poor did not receive cash assistance or food stamps, did not live in public housing, and were not eligible for Medicaid. About 80% of young rural adults had finished high school, and 13% had graduated from college, compared to 85% and 23% for young urban adults. However, rural/urban differences in educational attainment and the quality of educational systems do not explain differences in poverty rates. Some problems faced by young rural adult workers stem from changing demographics and the growth of low paying jobs in rural areas. Many observers feel that the problem of rural poverty requires federal intervention, such as tax  relief, welfare reform, or new economic development strategies. (SV)",

        "description":"This is a report on the first national examination of the effects of the Indian Child Welfare Act (Public Law 95-608), enacted in 1978. The study examines the prevalence of Native American children in substitute care and the implementation of the act and portions of the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 as they affect Indian children and families. The study addresses questions concerning: numbers and characteristics of Indian children in substitute care, the nature and quality of services available to the children and to families, how long the children stay in substitute care, programs' current and projected needs, and resources available to agencies and tribes. The report concludes that there has been progress in implementing the act, but that federal efforts to  communicate standards and monitor compliance have been limited. The act has not reduced the flow of Indian children into substitute care. Case records indicate tribal programs were doing a creditable job of following good casework practice, particularly noteworthy in light of inadequate funding. Funding for tribal child welfare programs often comes from a hodge-podge of sources that requires tribes to scramble and to compete for small and unreliable grants, making continuity of service nearly impossible. Off-reservation Indian-operated programs are seen as important service resources for urban Indian families. Such programs also offer foster care and placement while linking public agencies and tribes. Data suggest permanency planning in Bureau of Indian Affairs agencies is not being  practiced as well as in other programs. This report contains 13 references and numerous tables. (TES)",

        "description":"Oil, gas, and agriculture are the bases of rural Oklahoma's economy, and income from these sectors varied widely during the 1980s. This study investigated revenue sources and the effects of changing revenues for county and town governments and school systems in 36 rural Oklahoma counties. Major sources of local revenue were sales taxes, property taxes, and charges for services. State revenues transferred to local institutions came mainly from sales taxes, income taxes, gross production taxes on oil and gas, excise taxes on motor fuels, and license fees. Federal revenue was a relatively small part of total revenues. Town governments received about 85% of their revenues from local sources. Residents in 21 of 36 sample towns raised their sales tax rates between 1981 and 1986. County  governments received 40-50% of their revenues from local sources. Counties without a sales tax relied heavily on state revenue sources and were vulnerable to their fluctuations. State funds, subject to fluctuations, provided about 60% of the operating revenue for public schools. Interviews with 8 county, 12 city and 12 school administrators in 8 case study counties revealed that revenues did increase ahead of inflation in most cases. However, only two schools had added programs and teachers during the 5 year period, and eight had fewer teachers in 1986 than in 1981. Nine towns had reduced employee numbers, and others were using up reserve funds to maintain programs. Most counties had reduced employees, salaries, or programs.

Three members of the Select Committee on Indian Affairs presented background information on the act's intent to confirm the tribe as the primary authority in matters involving an Indian child's relationship to parents or extended family. Seven tribal members from Washington, Montana, Alaska, Oklahoma, California, and Arizona discussed the importance to Indian children of maintaining contact with their cultural roots; the high rates of placement of Native children in non-Native foster and adoptive homes, particularly in Alaska; and the problems of vague wording in ICWA and poor funding for tribal child welfare activities. A witness  from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) testified about the extent of the BIA's role in child placement proceedings and its funding and monitoring of tribal child welfare activities. State officials from Washington and Alaska described problems of inadequate funding and lack of Native foster homes. A Canadian speaker reported the unique problems of tribes that straddle the border. The Association on American Indian Affairs submitted proposals for two bills, one to fund Indian social services out of four existing federal programs, and the other to amend ICWA by clarifying and expanding its coverage, increasing tribal involvement and control, keeping families intact when possible, providing quicker proceedings, and creating compliance monitoring mechanisms. An advocacy group proposed an  ICWA amendment that would extend coverage to indigenous Hawaiians. Twelve additional tribal groups submitted recommendations. (SV)",

Jessie's House, in Hampshire County, Massachusetts, is a short-term emergency shelter providing meals, housing, and advocacy to homeless families and individuals. The shelter has a staff of three full-time residents and two part-time nonresident staff, serving about 18 &quot;guests&quot; each night. The program operates on a model that attempts to adapt itself to the particular needs of homeless people in the rural area. The report details the following 5 ideas central to the Jessie's House model: (1) a cooperative household that accepts a wide variety of members; (2) an ecological relationship with the community in order to provide the homeless with the  assistance they need; (3) a network of responses addressing the many needs of homeless people; (4) a team approach to service delivery, sustaining staff in a collaborative manner; and (5) responsiveness of feedback, assuring that the program will adapt to changing causes of homelessness. The paper also describes changes staff have made in the program since its founding. In 1985, the primary need of homeless people was perceived to be support services, and the Jessie's House staff worked to help other agencies develop and manage support programs. Today the perceived need is for low-cost housing, and Jessie's House is working to develop it. The paper emphasizes the importance of Jessie's House as a specific and flexible community response to the problem of rural homelessness.  (TES)",

Intended for use by rural and small town leaders and rural economic development specialists, the guide provides ideas, encouragement, and an &quot;insider perspective&quot; on alternative rural development strategies. Each two-page profile describes the project and the type of organization involved and includes funding information, benefits to date, and a local contact person. Extensive quotes from local community leaders highlight keys to success and pitfalls to avoid in implementing similar approaches elsewhere. Each successful rural development effort carries at least one of the following hallmarks: (1) capitalizes on existing resources; (2) focuses on  adding value to existing products; (3) aggressively pursues case transfer strategies; (4) helps existing businesses stay and expand; (5) incorporates education into the long-term effort; (6) seeks training and capacity building for local leaders; and (7) emphasizes research, planning, and long-term consistency. About 22 of these projects attracted industry to rural areas or developed industrial parks, 16 concentrated on small businesses, and 10 focused on tourism. (Author/SV)",

This paper summarizes the historical perspective of education's importance in the rural South and the attitudes of the general populace. Illiteracy, dropout rates, and the need to retrain workers losing jobs in agriculture and traditional manufacturing are major issues to be addressed in policy making. Also presented here are those aspects of health care, nutrition, and family economic status negatively influencing educational achievement. Issues of racial and sexual inequality are examined in relation to situations inhibiting learning and personal development. A significant factor contributing to the lack of quality rural education is the reluctance of rural  educational systems to educate residents who will migrate to urban areas for employment. A need exists for educational programs specifically targeting rural areas and addressing rural problems. Considerations of equity provide an argument for federal funding of compensatory human capital development and educational opportunities. Considerations are offered in this paper for options for federal educational funding policies. This paper contains 35 references. (ALL)",

        "description":"This series of case studies profiles six teachers thought by colleagues, students, and the rural Alaska communities they serve to be good teachers. The case studies reported here describe the techniques that make these teachers responsive and perceptive in their interactions with Alaska Native students. The names of the teachers and the villages have been changed to avoid inadvertently embarrassing the teachers or their students. The studies report that effective rural teachers learn about the context of their community and use this knowledge in their teaching. The local context consists of social, economic, political, historical, and linguistic aspects, all of which influence teaching and learning. Other contextual influences are indirect, such as the knowledge, skills, and  values that students bring with them to school. An appendix includes these sections: (1) Identifying Effective Teachers; (2) Instruments; (3) Collecting Our Data; (4) Analyzing the Data; (5) Dispositions; (6) Dispositions toward the Context; (7) Limitations of the Portraits.

The study is part of an ongoing effort to address concerns specific to rural and small schools in the United States. The focus of the study is on the condition of school buildings in rural and small school districts in the United States. The sample used was drawn from districts with student enrollments of less than 800 and existing outside of standard metropolitan statistical areas. Usable responses were received from 263 districts from 37 states. Information is categorized into individual building data and descriptive and financial data from each responding  district. In addition to general descriptive data, there is information specific to the methods used by each district in support of capital outlay. Data include district enrollment, expenditures for outlay and maintenance, sources for generating capital outlay, age of buildings, use and accessibility of buildings, safety of buildings, and replacement costs of buildings. The report is presented in two sections. The first section details the mean, standard deviation and range of the values reported for each variable by all respondents to the survey. It also offers the same values for each variable grouped according to the geographic region in which the school district is located. The second section analyzes each variable independently. Quartiles, histograms, boxplots, normal probability  plots, and frequency counts are given. There is no attempt to recommend changes for rectifying the situation. This report contains many graphs and charts. (Author/TES)",

        "description":"This paper describes a special elementary teacher education program developed at the University of Victoria, British Columbia (Canada). Designed to prepare students for rural teaching positions, this program consists of two years of university level education and two years of practice in a rural community. The educational system in the Province of British Columbia has been characterized by diminishing resources, declining enrollment, and increasing expenditures. Demand for teachers, especially in urban centers, has drastically declined, but vacancies for teachers continue to exist in rural areas. Rural teachers, however, are very mobile, either securing positions in large communities or leaving the classroom to begin new careers. Studies indicate rural teacher mobility is caused  by geographic isolation, lack of privacy, and limited professional contacts. Another reason contributing to mobility is a lack of preparation for either the unique learning environment of rural schools or the intimate relationship between rural schools and their local communities. The early field experience described in this paper allows students to study the rural community as a total entity and places the schools in a community context. Required activities include community and classroom projects. Education students trained in this program are expected to provide rural children with a high quality of instruction when they become practicing professional educators. An awareness of life in a rural community will also enable them to adjust more easily to the socio-cultural milieu of a small  town. Both these outcomes are expected to reduce the mobility of rural teachers. A chart outlines the chronology of the program. (ALL)",

        "description":"This monograph addresses the issues surrounding financing school buildings. Kansas finances school buildings from the property tax base of the school district in which the building is located. Local districts face fiscal constraints in maintaining and building facilities. The backlog of maintenance in Kansas exceeds $380 million. Research in Kansas indicates that inequities in facilities will widen among its 304 school districts, 80 percent of which are rural. Many other states finance facilities by providing grants to local districts. The monograph evaluates the legal potential for state responsibility to aid facilities in Kansas and provides recommendations for state involvement. It describes court litigation in Kansas and other states involving the issue of facilities funding.  The recommendations are based solidly in research, practice, and conservative extensions of legal principles. If research shows a relationship between facility adequacy and instructional outcomes, then courts will likely follow with mandates that the states bring their school buildings into compliance with predetermined minimum standards for describing adequacy for instructional facilities. The document includes tables on such data as: (1) age of buildings; (2) condition of buildings; (3) financial data on districts; (4) tax base of districts; (5) capital outlay; and (6) bonded indebtedness and capital outlay plans.

        "description":"This paper presents the rationale for the development of an elementary teacher training program designed to prepare students to teach in rural areas. The Province of British Columbia (Canada) is a vast geographic region populated by only two and a quarter million people. Most reside in rural communities ranging in population from a few hundred to several thousand. The schools in these small communities are the focal point of the teacher training program. At present most teacher training programs prepare students for teaching positions in urban centers and large rural communities. The University of Victoria, British Columbia, structured a training program to develop teachers specifically for these small communities. This program incorporates 2 years of univesity study with two  years of &quot;first hand&quot; experience of teaching and living in an isolated settlement. Students complete several community, school, and classroom projects dealing with the unique environment of a small rural settlement. To be awarded a Bachelor of Education degree, the students complete a fifth year of study at the main campus of the University. The rural elementary teacher training program more adequately prepares students for careers in rural schools and sensitizes them to the professional life of a rural teacher. Graduates of this program embark on their professional careers in rural communities with greater confidence. A chart outlining the time frame of the program is given. This paper contains 16 references. (ALL)",

        "description":"This document focuses on evidence from problem solving case studies which indicate that analogy, extreme case analogies, and physical intuition can play an important role as forms of nonformal reasoning in scientific thinking. Two examples of nonformal reasoning are examined in greater detail from 10 case studies of \"expert\" problem solving. Advanced graduate students and professors in technical fields were asked to think aloud while solving a physics problem. Spontaneously generated analogies were observed to play a role in the solutions, and several subprocesses involved in analogical reasoning were also identified. The use of extreme cases and beliefs based on physical intuition were observed, as well as imagistic prediction reports where the problem solver refers to imagining  or picturing an event mentally as he/she makes a prediction. The findings suggest that it may be possible to develop theoretical models for certain patterns of nonformal scientific reasoning. A table and six figures are included. (TW)",

        "author":["Ball, Deborah Loewenberg"],
        "description":"In spite of courses and workshops, beginning teachers are most likely to teach mathematics just as they were taught. Changes in certification requirements, such as expecting teachers to complete more coursework, or improvements in curriculum materials, such as programs that emphasize problem solving, have also been insufficient to alter the prevailing patterns of math teaching and learning in schools. Teacher preparation can be a more effective intervention if it is based on a conception of the teacher as learner, taking into account what teacher candidates bring with them related to mathematics and the teaching and learning of math. To do that, we need to know more about these learners and to develop effective strategies for working with them. This paper describes a project  implemented in an introductory teacher education course, a project designed to bring to the surface and challenge what entering teacher candidates know about mathematics and how it is taught and learned. With illustrations from the responses of participating teacher education students, the author outlines a conceptual framework for the question, \"What do prospective teachers bring with them to their professional education that is likely to affect their learning to teach mathematics?\" The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of this perspective for research and practice in teacher education.

This survey was undertaken to develop current baseline data on all secondary school teachers of physics in the United States, including those teaching in parochial and non-religiously affiliated private schools. The study was designed to elicit information from occasional teachers of physics as well as those teachers who specialize in the subject. The first three sections of this report include background information for the study including recent studies and methodology. Sections 4 through 8 focus on physics teachers. Information in these sections includes a profile of the  sample, salaries, job satisfaction, experience, career plans, and teacher attitudes. Section 9 examines the structure of physics curricula in the schools. Public and private physics education are compared in section 10. (CW)",

        "description":"Children learn arithmetic procedures by rote, rather than by constructing them with an understanding of numbers. Rote learning produces lack of flexibility, nonsensical errors, and other difficulties. Proposed is a theory of conceptual understanding and its role in learning and executing arithmetic procedures. The basic hypothesis is that principles constrain the possible states of affairs, thereby enabling learners to monitor their own performance and correct errors. A new knowledge representation is proposed, the state constraint. The theory has been implemented in the Heuristic Searcher, a computer model that learns arithmetic procedures on the basis of general principles encoded as constraints on search states. Simulated is: (1) the discovery of a general counting procedure  in the absence of either instruction or solved examples; (2) flexible adaptation of a counting procedure in respose to changed task demands; and (3) correction of subtraction errors in the absence of external feedback. The theory provides novel answers to several questions on conceptual understanding, generates testable predictions about human behavior, deals successfully with technical issues, and fares well on evaluation criteria. Future work will focus on how knowledge and experience interact in procedural learning. Over 110 references are included. (Author/MNS)",

        "description":"The science learning cycle developed by Robert Karplus and others in the 1960's has been a useful model for many science teachers and researchers. This model stresses the use of structured inquiry to organize knowledge acquisition and problem solving. Recent research in the cognitive science tradition, however, has shown that learning and problem solving are dependent upon more than general reasoning abilities. Intuitive views of the natural world, as seen by children, are often inconsistent with scientific views. These prescientific views must become known to both teachers and students before the correct conceptions can be constructed. The research described in this paper extends earlier research on the process of prediction which has been recognized as a key to determining the  value of scientific theories. Included are a summary of the research questions, background information, a description of the pilot study and its results, a description of proposed future research, and a list of 45 references.

        "description":"Misconceptions are systematic, intelligently conceived, and quite reasonable theories that have been constructed on the basis of experience. Research studies on misconceptions have indicated that students develop intelligently conceived and sophisticated concepts of science. Although some of these are compatible with the principles of modern science, others are incorrect, outdated, or unacceptable in a science-oriented culture. The views of science held by elementary students and the extent to which their views can be modified will depend on the teachers' conceptions. Possessing misconceptions will most certainly cripple the teachers' ability to identify and correct the misunderstandings students bring with them into the classroom. This study aimed to identify the life and  physical science misconceptions of preservice elementary teachers enrolled in three sections of a science methods course offered at the University of Texas at Austin during the spring semester of 1988. In particular, the study had as objectives, to: (1) identify preservice teachers' misconceptions in the physical and life science concepts; (2) develop, field test, and revise multiple-choice test items designed to identify the physical and life science misconceptions of preservice elementary teachers; and (3) correlate the scores on the pilot versions of the \"Physical Science Misconceptions Test\" and \"Life Science Misconceptions Test\" to preservice teachers' academic ability/achievement indices of science and math knowledge.

The purpose of the project was to develop closer linkages between practice and research in didactics in mathematics and science education. A state-wide research network was created of higher education faculty with research interests in mathematics and science education and clusters of pre-college faculty in the same disciplines interested in learning about or collaborating in research. This network would serve as a vehicle for identifying areas of research of concern to pre-college teachers, engaging teachers at all levels in collaborative efforts, facilitating research projects, and disseminating research results to classroom teachers. The  rationale for the project, how the network was designed and formed, and the results of collaboration are discussed. Advantages and disadvantages or problems are listed, with suggestions for improving collaboration possibilities. Eleven references are included. (MNS)",

        "description":"In many upper-elementary school classrooms, students are given few decision-making prerogatives. In junior high school, it becomes increasingly rare for them to receive the decision-making opportunities they believe they should have. Both person-environment fit theory and pawn theory would predict that a failure to provide students with such opportunities in their mathematics classrooms will prompt them to devalue mathematics. This study tests this hypothesis. Students from 12 school districts in the Transitions in Early Adolescence Project in the Detroit area completed questionnaires in the fall and spring of two successive school years. Reported are data from 1,823 students in grade six during 1983-84 and in grade seven the next year. Assessed were student perceptions of actual  and ideal decision-making opportunities in mathematics classrooms. Overall a substantial increase in constraints on students' decision-making prerogatives coincides with the transition to junior high school, and there is a steady increase in lack of decision-making across sixth and seventh grades. Students who experienced a lack of decision-making in their mathematics classrooms perceived mathematics to have less intrinsic and utility value than did students who had more decision-making experiences. Twenty-nine references are listed. (MNS)",

        "description":"While numerous surveys have shown that women academics are being hired in increasing numbers, white women from working class backgrounds are disadvantaged in obtaining tenure track university positions, because they have degrees from less prestigious universities, and their backgrounds have not prepared them for the publish or perish atmosphere of academia. The socialization of working class women encourages their nurturing instinct, and this instinct promotes: (1) accepting heavy advising schedules; (2) involvement in university services and professional issues; (3) becoming attuned to female undergraduate needs; and (4) becoming role models. These women often accept heavier teaching loads as graduate students because of the extra income it provides and their own values toward  teaching. These activities can fill up the time needed to do research and prepare articles for publication which plays an important role in the academic position review and the tenure review process. As a result, working class women remain relegated to instructorships and adjunct faculty positions. As feminists, the women bring a different perspective into the classroom because of their own sensitivity as outsiders. Some solutions to this problem of social class discrimination include sharpening awareness of women's diverse backgrounds, breaking down academic hierarchies, phasing out temporary positions, and replacing them with permanent appointments.

        "description":"One of the obstacles to the internationalization of college curriculums is the nature of faculty training. In recent years there has been a decline in second language requirements for the doctoral degree, and, as a result, college faculties become increasingly anglophone in their research. But there is a considerable pool of international experience among the faculties at larger universities that is not being used in the classroom to promote internationalism. These faculty members are classified as: (1) the &quot;missionary&quot; who does consulting abroad but knows no foreign languages; (2) the &quot;converted&quot; for foreign-born faculty member who does not bring the earlier foreign experience into the classroom; (3) the &quot;plunderer&quot; who does research abroad but publishes only in U.S. journals;  and (4) the &quot;bon-vivant&quot; who travels abroad for pleasure. To encourage faculties to share their experiences, universities must promote revision of the curriculum to incorporate this experience and increase released time for faculty development, sabbaticals, and travel funds. Foreign language knowledge can provide students and scholars with a better understanding of world perspectives, and second language instruction should be encouraged. (DJC)",

The results, deficiencies in methodology, selective reporting of data, and the policies based on the research are highlighted. To substantiate a request for more complex and scientifically-based research, rather than the relatively simplistic but politically-appealing sex difference approach, an analysis of verbal interactions involving 113 students in 24 science classes for year 8 in Brisbane, Australia was conducted. The interactive categories for teachers included organization, behavior, and task; initiation and response were used for students. Superficial analysis of the data included a bias in favor of male  students, but a detailed analysis indicated that the interaction patterns of female students were not significantly different from those of the male students. The differences that did exist can be explained by the activities of particular subgroups of both male and female students. The conclusion was that certain individuals receive more attention, and therefore, both male and female students were being disadvantaged. Tables and a 46-item bibliography are included. (DJC)",

Education commenced when the child reached five or six years of age and usually ended at puberty. Formal learning continued for children whose social standing ensured them of a government position. Social and economic mobility for male peasant children occurred occasionally. After the British conquered Burma, various British acts regarding education were implemented that led to the establishment of a public school system to replace the monastic schools, and education was extended to include female children. In contrast to the Burmese educational system, Siam's  King Rama V used the monastic schools for advancing his educational reforms. These reforms included a training school for government officials, increased educational instruction at the monastic schools, government supported provincial schools, and teacher training for the monks.

        "description":"This paper argues that the socio-economic transformation caused by the 1971 Suki Agricultural project in central eastern Sudan has had contradictory effects on children. The Suki Agricultural Project was expected to transform the rural economy from production for consumption to production for exchange and profit. Ten years after the project's initiation, 10-year-old children were observed for their roles in agricultural production and their provision of subsistence within the household and their acquisition of knowledge and skills. Since the 1971 project changed production and reproduction as well as the local ecology, the project required greater labor contributions from children. Deforestation associated with the project meant that children had to spend more and more time  collecting less and less accessible firewood, while the rise of the cash economy turned wood and water into commodities and increasingly involved children not only in their procurement but their sale. These activities, along with the production and sale of other commodities such as garden produce and charcoal, and including their own labor, left the children little time for play or formal education. The future for these rural children included: (1) labor migration of males from the village; (2) low job skills resulting from little formal education; (3) decline in rural productivity; (4) women taking a more active role in agricultural production; and (5) an adult population unable or unwilling to carry out the production tasks from the Suki Agricultural Project.

An irony in the current trend toward global education is, that it permits teachers to forget that one of the biggest curricular reforms of the 1920s and 1930s was the \"expanding environment\" approach, whereby children were taught concepts of self, families, schools, neighborhoods, and regional environments before taking up such vast considerations as the oneness of all humankind with which the globalists would  now have them begin. An emphasis on reflective decision-making is criticized for its failure to promote the learning of social studies facts. The few social studies-related courses that most school systems require will not endow future citizenry with informed political visions. California is lauded for its recent social studies curriculum guide, \"The History-Social Science Framework,\" that combines history, geography, and civics into a 12-year sequence promoting the teaching of democratic values.

The report concludes that teachers were generally satisfied with the training they received and the curriculum model; implementation was not possible in all types of New York City schools because of limited participation by active nonpublic school teachers; most of the participating students were 10th and 11th, not 12th grade, students; and the lack of a control group of non-project students made it impossible to determine whether  changes were due to program participation or to other factors. Recommendations include suggestions that the curriculum model contain a comprehensive table of contents, stipulate minimal course requirements in terms of student skills, knowledge, behaviors, and out-of-class projects and that project administrators and the New York City Office of Educational Assessment develop a strategy for assessing students' attitudes and knowledge.

        "description":"This document reports on the history of social and behavioral research studies concerning nuclear war since 1945, highlighting those studies that focused on adolescents and their feelings of fear, hopelessness, powerlessness, and denial. A study, designed to assess the reactions of adolescents in grades six to eight to the threat of nuclear war is described in terms of the participants, instrumentation, and results. The developed instrument, the Nuclear Anxiety Inventory, found that the major factors affecting students' beliefs and feelings are fear, futurelessness, and powerlessness. Moreover, the fear that adolescents experience is both cognitive and psychophysiological. Powerlessness is reflected in student beliefs that they cannot affect change and have no control. Adolescent  feelings of futurelessness include beliefs in the futility of planning for the future, in near-future extinction, and in living life as fully as possible when young, because so little time may remain. Thirty-two references, the inventory questionnaire, and tables are included. (DHP)",

        "author":["Zandy, Janet"],
        "description":"Anzia Yezierska and Agnes Smedley grew up in the United States in poverty-stricken, working-class families. Both women became famous authors and participants in social movements of the early decades of the 20th century. Yezierska's &quot;Bread Givers&quot; and Smedley's &quot;Daughter of Earth&quot;, published in the 1920s, were fictionalized autobiographies that detailed their growing dissatisfaction with the traditional role of women in society. The books contain several similarities. Both Yezierska's Sara Smolinsky and Smedley's Marie Rogers left home in search of a consciousness that poverty denied them and returned home again only to witness their mothers' deaths. The death scenes depicted a maternal bonding between mothers and daughters that had not existed before because the daughters had  been trying to escape the harshness of their mothers' lives. While Yezierska only touched on subjects of marriage, sex, and motherhood, Smedley wrote a polemic against marriage, as she attacked women's financial dependence, frequent childbirths, and loss of self. Both characters rejected their fathers for failure to financially support their mothers and offspring. Each book contains a scene where the daughters meet their fathers again after many years of separation. Smedley's Marie again rejected the man, while Yezierska's Sara took her father home. Both women searched for father substitutes in selecting husbands, and Sara assimilated into society through her marriage, while Marie divorced twice. Smedley left the United States for China. She died in Europe in 1950 under mysterious  circumstances following an operation. Yezierska died in California as she still searched for a home. A 5-item bibliography is included. (DJC)",

The assignment's outcomes included the ability to identify specific issues  and targets, to learn political strategy, and to effect student feelings of efficacy. Some cautions to instructors adopting this learning experience included: (1) the assignments must be nonthreatening to the student; (2) decisions for students should be avoided, but suggestions should be provided; and (3) instructors should be able to judge a student's emotional stability.

Specific problems are featured, and information is provided about legal, political, and economic issues and concerns. The paper stresses the need to stop thinking of these countries as politically homogeneous and to learn that socialist countries are becoming politically diverse. Openness in educational exchanges varies from country to country, but Hungary is a leader in international educational projects. Specific financial problems facing the exchanges include the lack of funds, currency regulations, and money exchange rates. New program rationales between Hungary and the United States include an increase in Hungarian student interest and  the need for students from both countries to experience a global education. Possible areas of cooperation between the two countries are: (1) undertaking joint research for coordinating existing projects, initiating new programs, and mutual planning assistance; (2) planning student exchange programs through government grants and financial support and between specific schools and providing for exchanges of resource materials; and (3) financing exchanges for specific students and teachers, establishing special foundations, and sponsoring joint exchange ventures.

One approach is to present U.S. history as a history of social relations among various ethnic groups and to stress the common legacy of events that has changed the lives of people. However, these events have affected ethnic populations differently, so the problem lies in how to equalize social and political history instruction. The curriculum should stress how these political events affected the various groups' lives and futures.

Issues of educational reform are also addressed within the context of minority academic achievement. Studies comparing cooperation or greater competition in the classroom appear to be in agreement that cooperative modes of learning seem to be more powerful in producing academic achievement in students. The educational significance of standardized achievement test scores is challenged as inadequately representing the kind of criteria that should be used to appraise the quality of schooling or their effects upon students. A review of literature on minority achievement finds evidence of increased achievement by minority students working in integrated classrooms.  A description of cooperative modes of education leads to the conclusion that, when compared with individualized methods, these modes appear to foster student achievement, to increase cross-ethnic friendships, and to improve students' self-esteem and positive attitudes toward other students in urban schools.

The Krajewski Study in 1970 studied the effects of a clinical supervision model that included videotaped review of preservice interns, none of whom had previous teaching experience. The ESEI Study in 1988 used videotaped lessons conducted by inservice science teachers for the purpose of evaluating their performance. The discussion includes descriptions of how the studies were conducted, the results of the evaluation/staff development process, and a summary of a participant attitude survey. Implications for preservice and inservice evaluators are discussed. (JD)",

This 'professional' definition excludes the influence of teachers on district- or state-level policies, regulations, guidelines, or plans. The essay asks why teachers act as they do in their own classrooms and schools, because that is where a teacher's autonomy can be most frequently exercised. Lack of autonomy is defined as failure to exercise responsible self-direction, not as freedom from supervision, because responsible self-direction is a quality of action rather than a state of being. The discussion here assumes that whatever the state of the profession of teaching, there are  measures that individual teachers can take to exercise responsible self-direction in their own classrooms. The discussion asks why comparatively few teachers adopt such measures. (Author/JD)",

The stimulus for in-water exercising among this survey population (n=1,180) was &quot;keeping fit&quot; through all-round body conditioning, which often was accompanied by an increased sense of wellness, relaxation and social interaction. Analysis of the data suggest that different benefits are derived from water exercise for  different age groups. Further, the data suggest that water exercise may well be the most important physical activity for older age groups. Recommendations for further study include investigation of water exercise programs for older populations and physical/mental rehabilitation of individuals. (Author/JD)",

It is pointed out that while the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) is committed to making its work more accessible to policy, research, and practitioner audiences, it remains difficult to gain access to information about existing and planned databases and research program agendas. An analysis is presented of effective ways to utilize information resources. It is suggested that one way to facilitate access is to organize the dissemination of the databases' potential around specific questions of interest. To demonstrate this method, questionnaires were developed on three areas of importance  for professionalism in teaching: teaching activities, professional development, and qualifications. For each category, a definition is outlined, some of the significant work in the area is pointed out, and a connection is drawn between the area and its importance for professionalism in teaching. The database information for each questionnaire is presented in the appendix. (JD)",

Data gathered from the study are presented on tables. They present the quantitive levels of career ladder project acceptability described on the basis of specific program components and demographic conditions. These averages are initially broken down by the following seven demographic factors: (1) gender; (2) career ladder participation; (3) position in distrct; (4) years of teaching  experience; (5) degree currently held; (6) ethnicity; and (7) level taught. These dually stratified results are also aggregated across all respondents for Phase I, II, and III districts. (JD)",

Thirty-one subjects were followed over a 3-year period through their preparation programs and into their second teaching year. Findings suggested that beginning teachers use conscious selection, processing, and use of information for the purpose of establishing for practical purposes professional beliefs and practices. Rationalizing compromise between preferred practices and choosing the path of least resistance is characteristic of this strategic adjustment. Specific kinds of school factors such as non-responsive or disruptive students, were associated with teachers' modification or setting aside of university learnings. Findings also suggested that beginning teachers  who taught large numbers of non-achieving or culturally different students in urban schools came to use these students a role models, implying reverse socialization.

The positive relationship between parents and school staff provides important support for school aims. The \"High School and Beyond\" data base and results from the Administrator and Teacher Survey (ATS), provided the core data for this analysis of the school as a community as reflected by teacher behavior and expectations for  student achievement and behavior, and the possible consequences of a communal school organization on students.

A brief summary is given of the literature on induction and beginning teachers, and a description provided of the organization of early childhood education in Queensland. At the beginning of the year, the areas in which the largest proportion of first-year teachers expressed confidence were interacting with children, communicating with parents, and program planning. However, they wanted help in programming as well as administration and strategies for interacting with particular children. A need was felt for assurance and moral support, especially at the start of their teaching careers. As the year progressed, teachers tended to  become more concerned with task-oriented and child-oriented issues and less concerned for their personal security. The study indicated that the needs of a majority of beginning teachers were being met. The most frequent sources of help were advisory teachers, the director or teacher-in-charge of the center, and aides or assistants. Recommendations are made for improving the induction of beginning preschool teachers. (JD)",

The 12- and 15-month programs, though packaged slightly diffferently, provide future teachers with the necessary skills for survival in the beginning teaching years and beyond. The program teaches effective teaching strategies as applied in the Tennessee Instructional Model (TIM), and selected strategies from Adler's Paidiea, the Florida model, and Joyce and Weil. In the phased internship, students are placed in public school classrooms with classroom teachers to observe, advise, and evaluate them. In the immersion internship, the students serve as regular teachers with a reduced teaching load of three classes. During  the internships, the interns are encouraged to try, revise, and assess their use of the various instructional strategies. This paper assesses the degree to which the graduates of the internship programs used the various teaching practices and behaviors, especially those associated with the TIM model. (JD)",

In order to be included in the synthesis the studies must have been: (1) data-based; (2) conducted on beginning teachers in an induction program; and (3) reported since 1977. A total of 17 studies were included in the synthesis. Findings are organized around five common goals of teacher induction: (1) to improve teaching performance; (2) to increase the retention of promising beginning teachers during the induction years; (3) to promote the personal and professional well-being of beginning teachers; (4) to satisfy mandated requirements related to induction and certification; and (5) to transmit the culture of the system to beginning teachers. As this synthesis  reflects, there is research data to support that induction programs can be successful in achieving each of the five stated goals. In addition, the studies collectively include important findings about four other points: (1) the need for flexibility in induction programs; (2) the important role of the support teacher; (3) the importance of placement in beginning teacher success; and (4) the need to educate the profession (as well as the public) about teacher induction.
