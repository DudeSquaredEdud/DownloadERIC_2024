        "description":"A theory that there is a correspondence between Piagetian conservation operations and groups of symmetry transformations, and that these symmetry transformations may be used in explaining human problem solving behaviors, is developed in this paper. Current research in artificial intelligence is briefly reviewed, then details of the symmetry transformation theory are given along with examples of its application. The Tower of Hanoi Problem is extensively analyzed as an illustration of the theory. (DT)",

        "description":"This study was conducted to determine what attitude changes take place in a group of secondary school teachers as a result of participation in a short course on the environmental problems of air pollution, water pollution, noise pollution, population problems and the use of natural resources. A secondary purpose was to determine if the teachers perceived the course structure as an effective method for presenting environmental topics. Participants, 43 in the experimental group and 45 in the control group, were given two questionnaires relating to environmental attitudes and environmental management. Examination of resulting data by analysis of variance indicated a statistically significant change in responses occurring for 18 of the 30 items on the questionnaire dealing with  environmental attitudes, and for 25 of the 30 items on the questionnaire dealing with environmental management. In the third aspect, the structure of the course was perceived as highly acceptable by the participants. The three evaluation instruments and tables of group responses are appended. (BL)",

Findings and recommendations summarized in the report indicate there was agreement on a population policy for the developed countries leading toward stabilization. The group agreed that the current declining population growth rates in the Atlantic Community are desirable and that all measures to promote these trends should be encouraged. These trends, if continued, could result in a zero growth rate around the year 2000. The conference provided an overview of how intermeshed  population problems are; how many legal, technical, ethical, and personal questions are involved; and how urgent is their need for solution. The role of the United Nations in World Population Year 1974 is also considered. Appended items give tables of population projections by country and region and a list of conference participants.

In general, it is responsible for conducting research and demonstrations, for establishing and enforcing standards, for monitoring pollution, and for assisting state and local governments in their own efforts. EPA's legal authority and responsibility for conducting activities in the areas of air and water pollution, solid wastes, pesticides, environmental radiation, and  noise are enumerated. Although each topic discusses legal aspects specific to itself, they all tend to cover the legislative background, various standards, implementation plans, enforcement, grants, research, and other legislation. Worldwide pollution is also considered via a review of international conventions, projects, standards, and abatement conferences. A bibliography of reports, acts, and regulations is included. (BL)",

Of the two reports included here, John Zell's deals with the anxiety involved in change despite its desirability in humanizing the humanities. Paul Olsen deals with the act of teaching and its translation by purposeful action into a humanizing action; it speaks specifically of insights gained during a student strike over Cambodia.

        "description":"In Spring 1967, the &quot;Leadership Group of High School Teachers of Economics&quot; in Orange County, California, expressed interest in developing an Advanced Placement Program (APP) in Economics. They were concerned that students from the stronger secondary school economics programs would find introductory college economics repetitive. This concern launched a project to investigate the feasibility of an APP in economics for secondary schools in Orange and Los Angeles counties. The findings of this investigation are presented in this report. In this study, APPs are defined as college level courses of study taught at and by the high school. Chapter I of this report looks at the nature and objectives of APP. In the second chapter, the College Entrance Examination Board APP, and selected  non-high school focused APPs are looked at. The criteria for and status of APPs in Economics are discussed in Chapter III. The final chapter sets out general characteristics of APPs adapted for application to programs in economics; the role of the college; steps in establishing an APP in economics in Orange County. Appendices include: a survey to assess feasibility of an APP in economics in Orange County; and the results of the Fair Enterprise Medallion Contest, which suggest that high-ability students from local schools can meet the standards applied to college students in Introductory Economics, and that the high schools and their teachers are able to train them.

Today's &quot;revisionist&quot; historians condemn the progressive of Dewey's persuasion, who sacrificed the individual to socialization and the institution of American education, and espouse Paul Goodman's and Theodore Roszak's ideas about the individual's survival in spite of society. The author sees the &quot;revisionists&quot;, trapped by their fear of loss of freedom, denying socialization in a gesture of revolt; she finds similar themes in American literature. Acceptance of the reality of socialization, a contour that must form every individual's life, would provide a balanced view of education  and life. She emphasizes the normal tension between freedom and social exigencies, which would require a change from revisionist revolt and negativism but a retention of individual and social awareness. (JH)",

Classroom participation, classroom politicization, sense of school efficacy, political knowledge, various personal characteristics, as well as sense of political efficacy are measured to ascertain their relative influences on the last variable. The results show class participation having no reliable affect. Personal characteristics, especially grade level, and classroom politicization do influence a student's accumulation of political knowledge. Grade level has an independent affect on school efficacy as, to a lesser degree, does political knowledge. The culminating influence of  school efficacy out-weighs that of political knowledge in shaping a student's sense of political efficacy, and though the two appear as the most important variables, the greater influence of school efficacy overwhelms the original hypotheses of the importance of classroom interaction.

The book is arranged into three major chapters. In chapter one the broad concerns, objectives, and rationale for the teaching of art is related to the individual, the culture, and community are introduced. Although the major portion of chapter two is devoted to discussing several current teaching approaches, the history of art education in the United States is also  reviewed. Chapter three deals with art in the elementary school and the community. Roles of the elementary art specialist, teacher, and supervisor of art, suggestions for improving and changing the program, and art in special education are discussed.

The major and remaining portion suggests techniques that include student-oriented, interdisciplinary, behavioral objective, perceptual, experiential, and artist-in-residence approaches toward the teaching of art. Art in the secondary school and the  community are discussed in chapter three. Aspects of teacher education, the learning environment of the public school in relation to time, space, and numbers, change in art education, and finance for art programs comprise the first section of the final chapter. The last section deals with art in the community, suggesting alternative approaches to art education, and ways that the school can incorporate community resources to enrich the art program.

In an introductory statement prior to the press conference, the question of whether or not we as a society can manage our human resource development is raised. The crisis of performance within our institutions, of resources, of equity, and of control, has become a crisis of confidence. A new approach to HEW and to social problem solving is seen as necessary. Progress made in educational legislation, in social security benefit increase, and in other social reform legislation indicates that the department has benefited from changes in  planning and management. Questions raised by the press dealt with revenue sharing, states' responsibility, comparisons between this and other countries' social welfare programs, desegregation, educational funding, mental health, medical research funding, and HEW administrative policies. In his answers, Mr. Richardson placed emphasis on progress made in legislation, further program achievements needed, and in the need for evaluation of programs at all levels to ensure efficiency in planning, in placing priorities and in continuation of efforts.

Objectives of the study were to provide opportunities for students to: 1) identify the substance, range and focus of their value pattern; 2) examine their values against prevailing and emerging politico-economic, religious-ethnical and secular ideologies; and 3) clarify, test and reshape their value patterns through group discussion and individual analyses. Three inventories were used: Thirteen Secular Ways of Living; Six Politico-Economic Ways of Living; and Nine Religious-Ethical Ways. Each &quot;Way&quot; was a value pattern (a group of related beliefs with a  focus) which was rated on a seven point scale and then ranked within each inventory from closest to and farthest from the student's stance. Data from the three classes are longitudinal to the extent that freshmen data include responses of sophomores. But this report is limited to changes in intercorrelation between value patterns from freshmen to senior years on the inventories. Findings show that there were 21 significant intercorrelations between the 28 ways for first term freshmen, 49 for third term sophomores and 66 for second term seniors. (Author/SJM)",

        "description":"One approach to the abatement of pollution is that which stresses that an informed public will, because of an altruistic motive termed \"civic responsibility,\" control the disruption of the environment, before such disruption reaches a perceived 'crisis' state. This paper discusses the public approach to pollution abatement in terms of long-range or future planning. Studies conducted to determine public attitude reveal that awareness of pollution varies to an extensive degree; the presence of pollution does not insure that the public is aware of the full extent of environmental disruption or potential hazard. Lack of communication between the public and scientific experts may be a result of incomplete data, of government control, or of failure to interpret technical jargon. These  issues are further complicated by a lack of civic responsibility: when individuals are aware of pollution, failure to report it or complain about it is due to: 1) poor attitudes about any response to a report; 2) a lack of public leadership; and 3) a lack of knowledge about where to register reports. Pollution abatement will only be effective through coordinated efforts of planning and implementation by public leaders and any change will be gradual. (Author/JMB)",

Students develop lab carts, work in the Living History Center, review curriculum materials in the Materials Analysis Center, engage in research and develop materials on the environment, and assist in the lab publication program. The lab cart program is most successful. A lab cart looks like a bookcase on wheels, and contains books, periodicals, filmstrips, descriptions of human and community resources, slides, and a slide-tape presentation that serves as an overview of the topic. The Living History Center, has student-developed audiovisual units  focusing on aspects of Enfield's history. In the Curriculum Materials Analysis Center, new and revised materials are reviewed by student-teacher teams and rated for interest, accuracy, objectivity, relevance and value. Dig-Discuss-Do is an action-oriented program concerned with improving local and national environmental quality. Equipment and space for the labs are located in one room of the social studies department at each high school. All decisions are made jointly by students and faculty as a team. Over 200 students are involved in the labs on a voluntary basis--Enfield personnel think of this as an indicator of success.

        "description":"In the one-day annual Fair, students from junior and senior high schools in Dade County participate in a variety of activities including displays, slide shows, plays, films, debates, and a college bowl competition. The events provide opportunities for students to demonstrate their knowledge and skills in the social studies and exchange ideas with students from other schools. The theme for 1972 was Youth in Action, and topics for the entries were in the areas of geography, history, civics, sociology, psychology, and contemporary affairs. Several portions of the Fair were broadcast on the school system's radio station WTHS-FM. The Dade County Social Studies Council sponsors the Fair. In existence for several years, the Council is composed of student representatives from  participating schools. It was organized to plan activities that would permit students to meet and discuss the social sciences and current issues with fellow students. Over 30 schools now participate in the Council and the Fair. This year's budget for the Fair will be approximately $1,000 with a significant part of this amount supplied by donations from the community. A unique aspect of the Fair is that a student organization from an entire school district plans and conducts the event. Because they come from diverse backgrounds, the students must quickly organize and learn to work together to plan a successful Fair. James Fleming, Social Studies Consultant for the Dade County Public Schools, serves as a club sponsor, and teachers from Dade County Public Schools serve as advisors to clubs  in their schools and assist their students with Fair projects.

Planning for the general program began a year before the course was to be taught. The program, now self-supporting, has two major expenses--released time for the elementary and secondary teachers, and transportation for the high school students to the elementary schools. No special teaching materials or building facilities are required. With the cooperation of the high school and elementary teachers, the high school students plan social studies units at the beginning of each six-week period. The major topic is introduced, and the high school students then work with small groups of elementary students to study the topic in  depth. Major needs that can be met through MAL are: 1) high school students have more opportunities to apply their knowledge than are usually provided in the secondary curriculum; 2) elementary children receive more individual instruction and begin to learn at a rate nearer to their potential; 3) high school students explore their feelings and attitudes toward working with elementary children; and, 4) the improvement of communications and work relationships between the elementary and secondary schools. Evaluation results indicate that the high school students have a lower absence rate during the semester in MAL; and there is a slight improvement in the overall grade point average for these students.

Students come from St. Paul's neighborhood high schools, night school, and Open School. They may attend a nine-week session in the morning or afternoon for 2 1/2 hours. The eleven permanent staff members are assisted by a host of community volunteers, ranging from community members attending a neighborhood storefront college to a consultant experienced in making movies and videotapes. The curriculum is designed to encourage personal responsibility for individual actions and to provide a situation where there are real consequences to student choices and actions. Programs are offered in three major areas: 1) The People's Co-op, which focuses on  community involvement; 2) Mass Media/TV Workshop, designed to provide students with the necessary scientific tools to understand the environment and to instill in them a social commitment to use such tools in attempting to solve environmental problems. Each student who enters the School chooses which course of study he will pursue. After the first week, he writes his personal goals for the course. The student and teacher together review these goals and evaluate progress toward reaching them. (JLB)",

        "author":["Clarke, Peter"],
        "description":"This field experiment examined three responses of ninth and tenth grade students to attending symphony performances at school. Responses were attitudes toward the performance, later information seeking about the art form, and interest in obtaining a recording of symphonic works offered four weeks after the concert. Pre-concert experimental manipulations were hypothesized to increase levels of these responses. The main feature of manipulations was distribution of 45 r.p.m. recordings of concert exerpts with a suggestion that students might enjoy listening to the records with friends or family before attending the performance at school. Ten junior and senior high schools were assigned randomly to the three treatment conditions--control, mail distribution and class distribution.  Questionnaires were group administered to respondents two days after they had had an opportunity to attend a school concert. The record offer was mailed to respondents at home 30 days after the performance. Results show that the experimental records have the same effects, regardless of distribution method. However, record distribution did not achieve the desired effect of increasing respondents' perception of other persons in their social environment who were thought to enjoy symphonic music. Most important, distribution of records had a clearly negative effect on concert responses--attitudes, information seeking and continued interest in symphony, indexed by responding to the delayed record offer.

In the process of experimentation, however, he began to feel that some specific preconceptions were warping his investigation and were detrimental to a useful study of creativity. In this report he reviews the various modes of approaching analysis of creative cognition, pointing out their shortcomings, in particular isolating variables of behavior rather than identifying systems of behavior. The implication is that modern data gathering methods are tailored to the method of analysis, not the content under analysis. The author emphasizes the need for more creative \"cognitive maps,\" internalized  modes of thinking, to be brought to the question of analyzing creative intelligence.

Not intended as a progress report, it does review and defend the present structure of the department, with its complexities and divergencies, under the direction of a Cabinet Officer; the interdependency of comprehensive planning is emphasized. The question raised is whether our society can effectively manage our human resource development. Part II examines the department and its operating efficiency, reviewing recent administrative changes and citing the need for evaluation. The crisis developing in this country in the political control of  federal programs and funds is discussed in Part III--a crisis of confidence. Recommendations for future reconception and regeneration are made in the following areas: Financial assistance to individuals--ensuring dignity and independence; Financial assistance to states and localities--reforming the intergovernmental delivery system; Capacity building--closing the performance gap. In summary, the former Secretary of HEW urges increased citizen participation in decision making and in realistically facing responsibilities. (JMB)",

        "description":"The study has examined variations in family socialization practices among Anglo-Americans and Mexican-Americans and the effect of these practices on achievement values, self-concept, and educational achievement. Data were collected and analyzed on 102 junior high school students and their families. Factor analysis techniques and Guttmen Scaling were used to generate a series of measures that describe the achievement training and independence training that the child experiences in the home, his self concept, and achievement value orientations. The Mexican-Americans studied apparently experienced much less independence training than did their Anglo peers. Mexican-American boys in particular were granted little autonomy in decision making; had little confidence in their ability to  succeed in school, and were fatalistic about the future despite the high level of achievement training to which they are exposed in the home. Results suggest that direct attempts to encourage greater academic effort on the part of the student may actually inhibit academic performance. In contrast, parental independence training results in significant gains in achievement among both groups. This is accomplished by increasing the student's confidence in coping with his physical and social environment, especially with the classroom situation where students are expected to perform independently.

Three substantive concepts -- conflict, violence, and authority were discussed in an effort to determine what should be learned by students about each; the problem of interdisciplinary research on these and other topics was given theoretical consideration; and suggestions as to future work by individual and sponsoring organizations were explored. The inquiry provided an occasion for individuals with different academic viewpoints to discuss these inter-relationships and,  offered an exchange between academics and educators. A brief critique of the inquiry program indicated it was overly ambitious, discussion was forced, the group too large, and that there was some misunderstanding as to whether the conference was to examine content rather than techniques of teaching about war/peace. Brief summaries of formal presentations exploring the three concerns above are attached to this report. Also included is an edited version of suggestions concerning what participants thought to be the most important about the war/peace field in education. (Author/SJM)",

Further, curriculum needs to be reassessed to embody these differences. In addition to four stated major objectives of social work education curriculum there are six functions of content and learnings vis-a-vis ethnicity and racism. Social work education curriculum needs to incorporate into the curriculum content which: 1) provides accurate information about the  historical developments and social contributions of racial minorities; 2) prepares the student for useful service in minority communities; 3) assists students in overcoming racists attitudes by imparting new knowledge and new values; 4) affords an objective analysis and understanding of the issues in order to help achieve cooperation between the races; 5) helps minority students develop a sense of pride, awareness, and confidence which is psychologically uplifting; and 6) serves as a means of developing new ideological orientations, to develop new theories and strategies for changing societies.

In many countries the problems are so complex that rational analysis is not undertaken; decisions are made on the basis of political expediency or on economically based criteria. In most cases, whole populations suffer deprivation and disadvantage, making it imperative to undertake programs which will have widespread impact. This meeting confined its discussions to the physical condition of children and studied the effects of malnutrition and endemic diseases on education and, at the same time, considered possible ways of solving the problems. The report contains a summary of the discussions covering the role of education against  malnutrition and diseases and exploring possible means of promoting government and international action in arriving at solutions. A second part includes some of the papers presented at the meeting. A bibliography is divided into four broad categories: 1) Nutrition; 2) Diseases; 3) Educational and Social Factors; and 4) Demographic, Economic, and Other Factors.

        "description":"This working paper offers considerations to be reviewed by the Faculty of the School of Behavioral and Social Sciences as it examines and reviews curriculum and effects changes for social studies elementary school teacher's improvement within the framework of the 1972 Ryan Act. Abolishing single discipline liberal arts majors, the new law emphasizes breadth of training in a wide range of school subjects, and authorizes colleges and universities to license directly only those who have graduated from an 84 unit diversified degree program. In response to this situation, the Academic Senate at CSU/SF approved a new 36-45 unit Liberal Studies major for a B.A. degree which when combined with 40 units of general studies credit will satisfy the Ryan Act's demand for a diversified degree  program. The new major emphasizes only unit totals. There are many problems associated with this new major which is open to all students, not only teacher candidates. The licensing act is taking effect at the same time that changes are taking place in elementary social studies. Decisions are discussed regarding two positions -- whether to deliberately design teacher education courses or whether most courses now offered can contribute toward achieving these goals.

A random sample of one hundred and fifty Kansas high school social studies teachers were mailed a two part questionnaire to measure the skills orientation and ranking of skills. Findings indicate that the most important social studies skills, according to the participating teachers, were the ability of the high school student to distinguish between fact and opinion, to  discriminantly read rewspapers, magazines, and pamphlets, and to apply problem/solving and critical thinking skills. Although the skills orientation of the two groups differed significantly the degree of importance attached to each specific skill by the &quot;high skills&quot; and &quot;low skills&quot; did not differ significantly.

In addition to an introductory speech by Dr. Samuel L. Myers, the work contains a main address, response, and commentary. Dr. John Carpenter, speaking in the main address of the interculture imperative, makes an appeal to reform general education which is often ethnocentric by the infusion of intercultural dimensions. Rather than proliferate special and elective programs, the author feels that there is a need to incorporate international dimensions in general programs. Planning suggestions for the creation of the intercultural dimension in university curricula conclude the address. Mr. Galo Plaza, in a response to Dr. Carpenter, reviews  reasons why a new international dimension is important to American education at all levels. In the commentary speech, Dr. Stanford Cazier concurs with Dr. Carpenter, stressing that general education in the U. S. needs to be reconceptualized. (SJM)",

The significance of the visual in the world today, in art, and as an aspect of technology which reflects the radical change that has occurred in the appearance of our environment, and the nature of the aesthetic experience are explored in the next two reports. The second part of the volume deals generally with the teaching of art. The development of art education, studied from an historical perspective, offers insights to better deal with art education in the present. Other articles, concerned with  curriculum and the teaching of art in elementary and secondary schools, focus on examining the fundamental learnings to be achieved in art classes and how these learnings can apply in different teaching situations. Part three discusses the art education profession, offering insights on the person who teaches an art program and dealing with the disciplines that bear upon his effectiveness; Bases for art teacher preparation; and research in art education.

Seventy-two graduate students were administered an aesthetic judgment test of fifty items. On half of the test, twenty-four subjects received correct feedback and twenty-four received false feedback. Another twenty-four received no feedback. Scores on the first twenty-five, the second twenty-five, and all fifty items constituted the dependent variables. Nine personality variable feedback condition analyses of variance were computed. Feedback was a significant main effect, with the trend of means (from high to low) being subjects in the correct, no, and false conditions, respectively. Only one personality variable (Intolerance of  Ambiguity) produced significant effects. Generally, intolerant subjects surpassed tolerant subjects. Intolerant subjects were relatively insensitive to false or no conditions. Tolerant subjects were adversely affected by no and false feedback conditions as compared to the true knowledge of results condition. (Author)",

The author also provides an outline of the implications that these methods of presentation have had on visitors. A major objective is to determine how history museums actually alter the basic relationship between the object and its beholder. Museum display development has been affected by at least five factors -- the taxonomic system used to organize the exhibit, the contribution of amateurs and specialists, the epistemological assumptions at work, the particular historiographical biases favored by each format, and the unresolved questions generated by each mode in the minds of visitors. Earliest  history museums emphasized perception rather than reflection, offering exhibits which were collections of oddities and eccentricities, while later museums organized their holdings within some taxonomic system. The resulting effect was an exhibit which focused upon visual aspects as represented by the period space displays of &quot;room&quot; museums, house museums; or re-creations of entire village communities. These museums displays typically suggest an air of social harmony, ignoring the historical epoch and concept of historical change. A suggested solution is to have the visitor directly experience relationships through simulation. (Author/SJM)",

Listed in this last section are statistics and descriptions of various studies; the latter cover the grading of arithmetic, the grading behavior of a college faculty, grades as they reinforce contingencies and attitude changes, student reactions to course grades, and many others. The summary concludes with a plea for a greater understanding  of the reportage system and the need for more attention given to the content (rather than the method) of reports. (JA)",

A two-part questionnaire, consisting of 13 descriptive items and a 10-item attitude scale, was completed by 553 elementary and secondary school administrators in the state of Minnesota. A frequency distribution was compiled to show degrees of attitudes and a Chi-Square analysis was made to compare groups of administrators. Attitudes were compared on the basis of administrator's age, highest degree held, geographic area from which the degree was earned, the type of school where the administrator was located, the level of his school, the population of the community in which he worked, and the degree of experience he had working with blind teachers. The responses indicated a positive  attitude toward blind teachers. The level of education of the administrators and the degree of experience they had working with blind teachers were the two factors which resulted in differentiating attitudes. Administrators with the most education tended to be more positive in their view of employing teachers. Administrators with prior experience with blind teachers also tended to be more positive.

Subject matter specialists might object to PBTE on the basis of a general distrust of reforms or the current limited philosophic and knowledge base for PBTE. It is up to subject matter specialists, however, to broaden the research on the matter. English is a good example of a discipline closely related to teacher education which is undergoing a far-reaching  self-examination which may lead to a redefinition of goals. Other disciplines face similar opportunities. PBTE can promote the most rigorous questioning of goals. Ultimately, each teacher can be more explicit about what he intends to do in his course, and he can begin to think of his work in terms of changes in student behavior. The question of assessment, though, is still a problem. (Related document is SP 006 578.) (JA)",

Some basic measurement and decision-making concerns are crucial to such an evaluation. Essential is a list of competencies. Problems in assessing attainment of these competencies include environmental factors, time factors, characteristics of both the pupils and the type of learning involved. But even in the lists of competencies already available, there arise questions as to exactitude of terms, as to whose performance, the teacher's or the pupil's, is being assessed, and as to the ability to assess behavior at all. Above all, it is important to establish a relationship between teacher  performance and changes in pupil behavior; the research to establish this relationship must one day be conducted. All things considered, the need for any measurement at all boils down to a need for a basis for more adequate prediction. Until the problem of assessment is surmounted, the real potential for a significant contribution of the PBTE approach will remain unknown. (JA)",

A definition of the term \"humanistic\" could include such qualities as freedom, uniqueness, creativity, productivity, wholeness, responsibility, and social humanization. As to freedom, a humanistic approach to PBTE would encourage people to act deiberately and intentionally out of self-framed goals; a problem is that such goals are not externally measurable. PBTE would in theory protect one's uniqueness, but would find conflict with the general standards of behavior society demands. The flexibility of PBTE could foster creativity, but this might suffer under the need for measurement. The humanistic idea of productivity, which is different from that of industry, holds that  productiveness comes from the center of the person. The wholeness of an individual might suffer in PBTE with its possible emphasis on short-term, isolated gains. The matter of teacher responsibility and PBTE brings back the question of the nature of teacher responsibility. As to social humanization, perhaps making teachers behave more efficiently in the context of the present authority structure may entrench the forces that have led to dehumanization. (JA)",

The faculty of the Middle School are utilized as supervisors of teacher education students with the belief that such work is of tangible benefit for the children in the Middle School. For teacher education students, the Middle School is a thorough training experience as the school provides a climate of continuous stimuli. The plan of action at the center should encompass three spheres of experience for veteran teachers and teachers in training: experiences that all teachers should have; experiences some teachers should have, and special experiences developed and directed by each individual teacher. The total picture  that should emerge of the center's work should suggest a school enterprise in which every person is responsible to and for one another. (JA)",

The time sequence for the first semester (16 weeks) is given along with prerequisites for the 10-week student teaching program. The program is further explained in case studies from Bruce, Seaton, and Truesdell elementary schools, Washington, D.C. A copy of the budget is  presented along with evaluation procedures. Copies of the following data forms are included together with definitions of terms and evaluation standards: the Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory, used to check preservice attitudes; teacher/student observation techniques; and a Micro-Teaching Check List. Contributions of the program to the improvement of teacher education are discussed, with emphasis on the direct, urban teaching experience. (BRB)",

In trying to discern relationships among selected variables, one major purpose was to identify teaching performances that potentially are more sensitive to training efforts. A series of factor analyses of selected subsets of variables did not reveal any factor which accounted for more than 10 percent of the variance. Teaching characteristics tended not to appear in factors  containing entry program variables, although grade level taught did have a relationship with teaching variables such as indirect verbal influence.

The Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory (MTAI), which purportedly predicts how well a teacher will get along in interpersonal relationship, was chosen as the instrument to obtain expressions of attitudes of student teachers to children and school work. Characteristics of a teacher which were deemed most desirable by school administrators were assumed to be those items included on forms used to obtain staff recommendations. The study was initiated just before the conclusion of a semester of student teaching. Within the limits of this investigation, little relationship was found to exist between the attitude of  student teachers as expressed at the end of a student teaching experience and the ratings of characteristics desired by school administrators.

For the latter three years, students were classified by the department which they indicated should receive their scores. For data from 1966-67, classifications were based on the fields which students indicated an intention to study. The latter means were unaccountably depressed. Declining trends in means were noted for the last three years studied for physical sciences math sciences, engineering, basic social sciences, applied social sciences, and the arts and humanities. A declining trend  in the Quantitative score was very strong for physical sciences, math sciences, and engineering, and a declining trend in Verbal scores was also noted in the other areas mentioned above. The trends noted are in agreement with the hypotheses of the study, though such agreement does not by itself imply any particular effective cause. Given these results, suggestions were made for a continuing monitorship of similar data and a validation of trends noted in the history file. (Author/KM)",

Research reviewed includes empirical, simulation and theoretical studies of adaptive testing strategies. Adaptive strategies identified in the literature include two-stage testing and multistage tests. Multistage tests are differentiated into fixed branching models and variable branching models (including Bayesian and non-Bayesian strategies). Results of research using the various strategies and research approaches are compared and summarized, leading to the general conclusion that adaptive testing can  considerably reduce testing time and at the same time yield scores of higher reliability and validity than conventional tests, under a number of circumstances. A number of new psychometric problems raised by adaptive testing are discussed, as is the criterion problem in evaluating the utility of adaptive testing. Problems of implementing adaptive testing in a paper and pencil mode, or using special testing machines are reviewed; the advantages of computer-controlled adaptive test administration are described.

        "description":"The lack of a universal definition of creativity has led to the assessment of creativity according to the definition favored by the evaluator. These assessments fall into four groups. The first centers around the concept of the creative product; it assesses a tangible event or relationship that results from the creative process, which is implied but not assessed. In this group, the work of one person is evaluated by a second person or group. A second group is concerned with the psychological health of the creative person and uses very subjective assessment techniques. A third group studies the environment in which creativity occurs on the premise that creativity can be facilitated or debilitated by environmental manipulation. It investigates the past or present environment of a  creator. A fourth group studies the creative process and consists of the affective and cognitive schools. The cognitive school views creativity as primarily an ability; the affective school views it as primarily an attitudinal phenomenon. These schools use observer, symbolic-task, remote associates, and interview approaches. These groups can be integrated and their functional relationships explained through a model based on a simple electric circuit: creative and convergent production are connected by an ability line which runs through an affective facet to draw from our experiences. As the attitude is depressed, creative production is short-circuited; as the attitude is heightened, creative production is increased. This model can be used to test a number of hypotheses about creativity.  (KM)",

Secondary purposes were to determine whether the two methods yielded similar or different priorities and whether there were any systematic differences in the views of certain districts and/or kinds of raters. Twenty-seven school districts formulated important objectives in social studies, communication skills, math, and science. Each of the 153 objectives was printed on a card, and the cards were divided into 4 decks for each of the subject areas. Within each of 31 additional district, four teams of raters were formed, each consisting of a student, a teacher, an administrator, and a community representative. Each team member, sorted each deck of cards  into three piles--below average importance, average importance, and above average importance--with a minimum of five in each pile. Each team also researched a consensus as to the 5-15 objectives it considered most important. The procedure was then repeated with the 27 districts involved in developing the objectives. The results indicated that certain objectives tended to be considered much more important than others and that this trend was consistent across different kinds of raters and districts and the two methods (i.e., individual raters vs. group consensus).

Research findings indicate that the response rate can be affected by various aspects of the questionnaire, type of sponsorship, use of incentives, special mailing techniques, and followup procedures. Other factors that survey practitioners consider important are the contents and approach of the cover letter and followup communications, personalization, promise of anonymity, and enclosing a stamped, addressed envelope. In conducting surveys, researchers have found a relationship between response and respondent characteristics such as sex, race, achievement, educational level, and occupation. These findings suggest the importance of making all  subjects feel they are valuable members of the population and employing motivating techniques that will win the cooperation of those more likely to be nonresponders. Survey literature also contains a large body of information on the psychological and mechanical aspects of designing a questionnaire that will appeal to respondents. Researchers stress the importance of subject identification with the study and suggest various techniques for gaining and maintaining their cooperation, including techniques for tracing respondents who have moved and/or changed their names.

A search was made, as part of the New Jersey Needs Assessment program to identify potentially useful EGI's and to determine what steps might be taken to develop others. The search was limited to those indicators for which data were already available in existing sources--primarily various publications and a public opinion survey being conducted, into which were introduced several items that could be the basis for EGI's. The results of the search are discussed under the headings of the 11 outcome goals defined by part of  the Needs Assessment program. The findings suggest a distinction between two types of indicators, intentional and incidental. Intentional indicators are those based on data gathered expressly for the purpose of measuring the degree of attainment of educational goals; incidental indicators are based on data gathered for some other purpose. A comparison of the two types based on ten characteristics of good EGI's reveals that intentional indicators are preferable. (KM)",

When instruments/procedures of this sort are used, the fit for pupils at both the high and low ends of the scale tend to be thrown seriously out of line to the end that they exhibit difficulty in showing any significant gain, while the average students seem to generate normal, expected gains. It has also become fairly evident that a number of pupil characteristics tend to grow at a painfully slow rate so that it becomes almost impossible to realize an appreciable gain in the relatively short space of a year or  two. One suggested resolution is to identify a reasonable, manageable number of pupil growth measures that have been found to be related to specific, measurable teacher behaviors and to build accountability programs that are predicated more on teacher behavior than on pupil growth factors.

This study includes a comparison of Area C pupils with a control group and an evaluation of the alternative programs within Area C. The self-esteem of Area C pupils was higher than that of pupils in a control group. On the School Sentiment Index, Area C pupils had a more positive attitude toward learning than did pupils in the control group. The attitudes toward school of the open area pupils were more positive than those in the self-contained room on all the concepts except learning. Pupils in the open area had higher  reading scores than pupils in the self-contained room, but their growth rates in reading were very similar. The features of Area C liked most by the pupils were the teachers, the free periods, and the freedom generally. The least-liked aspects were the noise and untidiness. The alternate arrangements in Area C appear to be providing for the differing needs of children and they are being well received by the pupils and their parents.

As a followup a team visited each school in October 1970. Reaction to the evaluation and followup varied. Most team members reported cordiality and cooperation from administrators. In most districts, those recommendations that could be  implemented without additional expenditures had already been made. A few evaluators reported encountering opposition or hostility to some recommendations, either directly, through criticism of evaluation procedures or personnel, or indirectly, through establishing committees to study the report and make recommendations.

To allow for differences in mental ability when comparing reading scores, Primary I and II levels of the Canadian Cognitive Abilities Test were administered to the Year I and Year II classes respectively. On the listening subtest of the Cooperative Primary Tests, the Year I experimental group performed at a statistically significant higher level than did the control group. The Year I experimental group also received statistically significant  higher scores on the Haggerty Reading Examination. The analysis of covariance for each reading test at the Year 2 level revealed no statistically significant difference between experimental and control groups.

Although problems of observation, computation, interpretation and categorization vary from field to field and from problem to problem, it is possible to design an instrument for use in any situation where time-variables have to be measured as duration and frequency,. The Polychronometer is suggested for such purposes. It is essentially composed of ten paired counter-timer sets each operated by a separate key. The ten keys are set in a keyboard which is plugged into the control box, each key being designed for a different finger of the left or right hand. A few hours of practice is sufficient to give an observer proficiency in operating the key board,  sufficient to adapt to the rapidity of moving events. Further work is being done to develop different polychronometric techniques for the analysis of behavior. (Author)",

        "description":"Visits in the Spring of 1972 to five school districts (Norfolk, Virginia; Texarkana, Arkansas; Gary, Indiana; Gilroy, California; and Grand Rapids, Michigan) that had implemented educational performance contracting programs during the 1970-71 school year are reported. Changes in the content and methods of instruction, measurement and evaluation, and management seem to have been brought about by the programs. The large gains hoped for by many proponents of performance contracting have not usually been achieved. In each of the districts, a diagnostic-prescriptive approach to individualization of instruction has been encouraged by the performance contracting programs. More attention is being given to the need for a wider range of self-instructional materials in such programs.  Programs that had been converted from performance contracts to in-house efforts tended to be adapted to individual teaching styles, and more diversity among classrooms resulted. With one exception, the 1971-72 programs used about the same resource support as they had the previous year, or even greater support was provided. Performance contracting (which is still largely limited to reading and mathematics courses) ties contractor payments to student test results and, therefore, focuses attention on testing and evaluation. The result has been increasing concern with development of better measurement techniques and evaluations. The performance contracting programs forced school administrators to become involved with the course of a project from the point of making contractual arrangements to  the implementation of the programs in the classrooms.

        "description":"Three types of evaluation used in program evaluation and the type of instrument or measure used are discussed. The three types of evaluation are: comparison group evaluation, analysis of learner outcome or product objectives, and process evaluation. Measurements employed are either direct or indirect. Most measurement in education is usually indirect, by which the subject may be measured while he either actively or passively participates in the measurement act. When it is determined that a test will be employed as a means of indirectly sampling some behavior, two basic kinds of tests are employed--the standardized norm referenced test and a criterion referenced test. Once the evaluation type and instrumentation have been defined, there is the question of the consequences of  evaluation. The object of evaluation is to provide decision-making information about programs. Steps in program evaluation are: (1) consideration of how objectives will be evaluated should begin prior to program development; (2) following consultation with evaluation personnel, the planning group should make decisions on what measurement instrument, performance objective formats, and criterion levels represent fair and reasonable assessment of learner outcome, product objectives; (3) a system for recording and reporting the results of process objective evaluation should be established in the school; and (4) product objectives and comparison group evaluation should take place at the end of the program.

The basic strategy for research on verbal development is dependent on a scheme which contains the following important elements: (1) a mapping of the entire verbal domain, so that results of researches in particular segments can be related to each other, (2) the use of the same scheme across investigators and situations where appropriate, to maximize understanding  both of the phenomena under consideration and of the investigators by each other, and (3) the development of reliable and longitudinal measures specific to the elements of the scheme. Verbal measures for use with children from three and one-half years of age to age eight-nine (Grade 3) are presented in a table, and verbal skills, receptive and productive, are also tabulated.

Five report cards were developed for primary grades and five more were developed for intermediate grades. Secondary schools were permitted to use any of five report forms. Questionnaires were distributed to 320 parents of the pupils. The principal findings were: (1) Of all methods of reporting, parents prefer a combination of report cards and teacher-parent conferences. By themselves, cards are more popular than teacher-parent conferences; (2) The questions that parents would like most to be answered are: How is my child progressing in his studies? Is he working hard enough? and Is he  happy in school? They are least interested in his behavior and social competence; (3) Parents were generally satisfied with the present report cards; (4) Most parents would prefer that the child's achievement be evaluated in relation to his own ability; their second choice was a comparison with a prescribed standard of achievement; (5) Parents would not be satisfied to receive report cards only when their children are doing unsatisfactory work; (6) Of all the systems used to report pupil progress, parents of children in elementary schools prefer, in order, symbols, letter grades, and teachers' comments; parents of secondary students prefer letter grades, percentage marks, and teachers' comments; and (7) Parents of secondary students want to be informed about absences from school and from  subject classes.

        "description":"Some of the problems involved in the use of intelligence and achievement tests with bicultural students are discussed. Some tests are &quot;fair&quot; to bicultural groups. The Arthur Performance Scale and the Goodenough Draw-A-Man-Test are fair to certain Hopi and Navajo Indian Groups. The use of these tests has been limited because they have not correlated highly with the academic achievement of these groups. The following guidelines are given for the testing of the intelligence of bicultural children: (1) it is unrealistic to expect an intelligence test to be magically &quot;fair&quot; to all cultures and accurately predict behavior when the values affecting the definition of intelligent behavior vary drastically; (2) tests which may be &quot;fair&quot; for one bicultural group may not correlate with  achievement and hence be of limited value to educators; (3) intelligence tests should not be given to bicultural students simply because it is routinely given to the other students; (4) individual tests should be given when feasible so that test-taking behavior may be better controlled; (5) a test which separates verbal and non-verbal scores may be more descriptive of the relative ability of upper grade bicultural students; (6) test results for bicultural students should be used with a great deal of reservation by people who are familiar with testing bicultural students; and (7) it is imperative that other sources of information be used in conjunction with read test scores. Achievement tests can be used as a measure of bicultural children's success in school, with reservations relating to  language and cultural factors. (DB)",

The Sensory-Perceptual Exam (SPE) contains measures intended to evaluate both relatively &quot;pure&quot; sensory functions, as well as those which involve more integrated and complex perceptual activities of higher cortical functioning. The tests thus far incorporated into the standard battery include the following: Spiral Aftereffect, Critical Flicker Fusion, Complex Reaction Time, Memory-for-Designs, Dot Determination, Auditory Pulse Rate Discrimination, Vestibular Perception of Vertical and Proprioceptive Perception of Vertical, Tactile Form Discrimination, and Color-Word Rigidity.

The subject matter of any one statement is coded by a string of descriptive words that indicate categories. These words are arranged in left-to-right order such that any one descriptor defines a subclass of the class defined by the descriptor to its left. Tests showed that usually six or seven descriptors would normally be sufficient to define the class of a statement, and in this program, a set of ten is invariant, but some on the right may be blank. The data deck contains a random number between -1.0 and +1.0, a title for the output, a list of 24 control descriptors for limiting the selection, the mean and tolerance limit of  difficulty of the statements to be selected, the number to be selected, the number of statements from which selection is to be made, and the number of sets to be selected. After an initial screening of the statements for possible selection, examination sets are selected. The first page of output contains the title, a general instruction, and the first 27 statements. The second and third pages contain the next statements, up to 27 per page. This program is invariant in assuming that 81 is the maximum number of statements that will be required. The fourth page of the output contains a string of T and F symbols in three rows of 27 each, corresponding to the logical values of the selected statements. Also, the last random number used is printed, and this can be the starting number in the next  use of the program. (For related documents, see TM 002 778, 789, 791-793.) (DB)",

This instrument was originally developed with a civilian population, and it became apparent that some questions were inappropriate when it was to be applied to a military population. Furthermore, it was believed that identifying significant dimensions of life stress might provide an indication of how the questionnaire could be revised to gain better results with military personnel. A cluster analysis was performed on the SRE responses made by members of the crews from three Navy cruisers. Four clusters of life events were generated. The item content was described as follows: (1) Personal and Social changes, (2) changes related to Work, (3)  Marital changes, and (4) changes related to Disciplinary actions. When the responses to the SRE, given by men aboard an aircraft carrier and a battleship were clustered, esentially the same four clusters evolved for both rated (petty officers) and unrated men. The only notable exception was the lack of a Disciplinary cluster for the rated men. The results showed that the clusters of SRE items were highly stable over very different Navy populations. Thus, they can serve as a guide in determining which items may be utilized or deleted from the questionnaire. Also, it is believed that development of these clusters may lead to an improved method of scoring the SRE items. (Author)",

This subject classification interacted with trials, representatives of friend groups manifesting a consistently high level of cooperation throughout, and representatives of stranger groups and individuals showing progressive increases from moderate to high levels of cooperation over trials. After 30 trials, subjects were given positive or negative feedback (indicating that they were doing better or worse than their respective reference groups). On subsequent trials, positive feedback yielded no strategy change for the three types of subjects. Negative feedback produced strategy changes for individuals and  stranger groups, but not for friend groups. A number of personality variables presumed relevant to decision style in the PD were examined. On both orientation to the PD--intention to be cooperative or competitive and expectation of cooperation or competition from one's opponent--and actual level of cooperation and competition in the PD, significant personality effects were obtained. Of particular interest in the latter case is the evidence that the influence or personality is manifested exclusively at the level of the dyad. It is concluded that the impact of personality on the PD can most profitably be studied with a dyadic focus. (Author)",

Questionnaires were directed to parents of children in eight kindergartens and to principals of the 34 elementary schools in Vancouver. At their homes, 95% of the kindergarten pupils had watched Sesame Street at some time, and approximately two-thirds watched the program regularly. At the elementary schools, Sesame Street was being viewed during school time to some extent by 2,000 pupils, and The Electric Company program had been seen by 300 pupils in eight schools; there were virtually no pre- or post-viewing activities. In each of the eight kindergarten classes, 11 performance tasks were administered to five pupils who  watched Sesame Street regularly at home and to five who watched it irregularly or not at all. The Coordinator and Consultants in Primary Education visited 20 or more classes viewing Sesame Street, and held discussions with teachers of these classes and with teachers of classes who had watched Sesame Street but had subsequently discontinued watching. A comparison of scores on the performance tests revealed that regular viewers of Sesame Street had superior knowledge and understanding of letters, words, numerals, quantities and shapes. Furthermore, their teachers claimed that the regular viewers had derived other important benefits, such as observational skills, more awareness of their surroundings, broader interest, greater sensitivity and consideration for others.

The Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills (CTBS) and the Short Form Test of Academic Aptitude (SFTAA) were administered to a sample of Missouri fourth and sixth graders. For each curricular area, Missouri achievement was compared to the national norm. For reading, math, and language, the achievement of Missouri students was also compared to their anticipated achievement, and the distribution of anticipated achievement in Missouri was compared to the 10-10 distribution of the norm group. Four main conclusions were drawn: (1) students performed at or above the national norms; (2) they generally equaled or exceeded what was expected of them; (3)  little relationship existed between school characteristics and achievement; and (4) when the achievement levels of students in the three district classifications (according to size) were compared, no definite trends in achievement across the four curricular areas were apparent.

There is clearly a segment of parents who feel that the school is too permissive in handling behavior problems and that discipline should be strengthened; a smaller group holds an opposite view. Parents seem satisfied with the range of activities available to students; however, they would like to see students participate more. A desire was indicated for more feedback from teachers and administrators about students' progress and, in general, more contact with the school.

The paper delves into the question of whether or not there is bias in faculty reports of time and effort and whether a pattern to any such bias might appear. The methodology for conducting the study involved gathering faculty estimates of time/effort using both questionnaire and diary instruments. A method for determining and quantifying bias was established and used in gathering data. Based upon the results of statistical treatments applied to the data, some observations and conclusions were made concerning the presence of bias in faculty time/effort reports. It was concluded that a diary is superior to a questionnaire for self-reporting of time/effort because no reliance  need be placed on memory or on an individual's ability to estimate average time expenditure.

Two objective multiple choice tests are constructed which sample different areas over the same course content. These two tests are used on alternate days. Two forms of each are prepared, with questions rearranged for the test to be used in alternate rows, so that students seated next to each other are answering the same test questions but in different order. Each instructor teaching the course contributes multiple choice items. One instructor, the test coordinator, prepares alternate test drafts, which are  finalized at an instructors' conference. Students record their answers on IBM 1230 answer sheets, which are graded by the instructor and then analyzed by computer. Computer processing consists of the following steps: determining each student grade; computing the arithmetic mean and standard deviation for each test form; converting each grade to standard \"T\" scores with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10; isolating the upper and lower quartiles; counting the various responses to the questions; determining the level of difficulty for each question; determining the power of discrimination for each item, and providing a printout by section and a printout for each test form.

Such consistency has increased interest in constructing scales based on Piaget's theory according to psychometric principles. Three major problems are discussed which present definite obstacles in the development of a general scale: (1) A Piagetian test, encompassing all stages and operations within individual states, would be so broad in scope that thorough testing may be precluded; (2) Piaget's clinical method of questioning may not be amenable to standardization, resulting in unreliability from a psychometric standpoint; and (3) Piagetian demonstrations have been presented in many different forms and at various degrees of  complexity; such diversity necessitates an imposing task of selecting a set of items most representative of the sequency of development. Considering these overriding problems, it is concluded that one scale representing Piagetian development in general may be an impossibility. (Author/KM)",

        "description":"A Vocational Interest Inventory was developed for vocational high school students with low reading level, short test-attention span, low IQ, and impoverished educational and family background. The VII, of which there are separate versions for boys and girls, consists of items representing job tasks, for each of which the respondent indicates his preference on a four-point scale. All items are presented pictorially and verbally, and most words are at a reading level of grades 5 to 6. A total of 212 boys and 106 girls in the validation sample, and 193 boys and 132 girls in the cross-validation sample, completed the inventory. The time required varied from five to ten minutes, depending on reading level. Factor analyses of responses were performed for both samples. Retesting was  conducted over intervals of 4, 9, and 13 months for the CVS and over 21 and 33 months for the VS to determine scale stabilities. Stability indices were low, suggesting that the vocational interests of low ability students are more fluid than the academic interests of students expecting to complete high school. Scales were found to have predictive validity for the clusters of shop courses offered the students. The VII also seems to satisfy most of Kuder's 12 principles of interest measurement. Only sample pages from the inventory are provided. (KM)",

This project included a critical appraisal of the methodology used in each study as well as the studies' findings. The convergence and divergence of findings are reported together with underlying methodological problems and recommended methodological procedures for survey research particularly as they pertain to enhanced understanding of the relationship between student development and the educational process. The major recommendation is that research should go beyond merely identifying causal or predictive  relationships, which is the current orientation, to explicating causal or predictive relationships with analyses that tell why a specific relationship exists (interpretation) and what conditions maximize and minimize the strength of the relationship (specification).

The original data of Wallach and Kogan, as well as the data from the Ward, Cropley and Maslany and Wallach and Wing studies were reanalyzed using Joreskog's Unrestricted Maximum Likelihood Factor Analysis (UMLFA). In addition, three of the Guilford studies and the Getzels and Jackson 1962 study on creativity and intelligence were reanalyzed using the UMLFA technique. These reanalyses provided clear evidence not only for the distinct creativity and intelligence dimensions but also for figural and verbal subfactors in the creativity dimension. The Wallach and Kogan materials were used in  an original research study with secondary school students in Brooklyn, New York. The two-factor structure of the creativity dimension was clearly verified, and the creativity measures were related to many more common measures of intelligence than have been reported. The creativity and intelligence measures were related to actual school grades in science, math, English, and social studies. Three factors clearly related to creativity, intelligence, and school achievement were identified. The independence of creativity and intelligence was verified, and a marginal relationship between creativity and school grades was indicated. Multiple regression analyses confirmed the conclusions.

        "description":"Because of misconceptions regarding appropriate measurement strategies, it is necessary to draw distinctions between two major measurement methodologies, norm-referenced and criterion-referenced measurement, as they relate to determining basic academic capabilities. Norm-referenced measures are used to ascertain an individual's performance in relationship to the performance of other individuals on the same measuring device. Criterion-referenced measures are used to ascertain an individual's status with respect to some criterion, that is, an explicitly described type of learner competence. Because of the wide use of norm-referenced standardized achievement tests, many assume that they are the only instruments that should be used to find out how well a school is working or a pupil  is learning. But typical standardized tests are unsuitable for these purposes because of problems with their interpretability and their psychometric properties. Criterion-referenced tests remedy some of these weaknesses because they can: (1) be more accurately interpretable; (2) detect the effects of good instruction; and (3) allow us to make more accurate diagnoses of individual learners' capabilities. If sufficient care is taken to support the development of high quality criterion-referenced measures, legislation to distribute federal funds on the basis of educational deficiencies rather than census determiners appears to be sound.

This investigation sought to determine the extent to which this regression is attributable to contemporary evaluation methodology. Analysis was conducted of the impact of standardized achievement tests on a population of low SES Black and Chicano fifth grade students. It was hypothesized that the effect of frequent testing would be that of depressing achievement test scores. Analysis determined that the typical student dropped an average of two stanines in reading achievement as a result of this testing. Additionally, this study found that: (1) Black and Chicano children learn more than standardized tests show; (2) Testing is a  high stress activity; and (3) Testing seriously impairs the teacher-student relationship. Research was conducted through structured classroom observations and interviews and interval analysis of test scores. It is concluded that standardized testing produces primary and secondary reactive effects which are destructive to self-confidence, achievement, and the academic ability of minority, low-income children.

As a result, program evaluators often choose mechanistic models and their resultant information is either inadequate or inappropriate for most of the client's purposes. The Ontological Evaluation Model proposed in this paper is based on a developmental assumption, namely, that humans in purposeful groups, organizations, reenact a cycle of development very much akin to the ontology of a single individual. An educational program is a special case of human organizational development. Program evaluation from this contextual premise, therefore, takes organizational development as its structural analog.

Performance contracting has been defined as an agreement between a local education agency, such as a public school, and a private educational firm, known as a learning system contractor. Payment to the contractor depends on student achievement. OEO initiated a major educational experiment over one school year in an effort to help poor children. The experiment was designed to assess the overall impact of remedial reading and mathematics programs conducted by private educational firms. A total of 27,000 students, 18 school districts, and 6 private educational firms were involved. It was found that the firms  operating under performance contracts did not perform significantly better than the more traditional school systems. (Author/CK)",

Cliques and isolates/rejects were examined as to their ethnic makeup. Ethnic self-preference was examined, and the relationships between children's sociometric position of workship questions and achievement were investigated. White, black and Asian children did not appear to have been influenced by ethnic grouping in friendship, leadership and workship choices. A preponderance of ethnic self-preference was not evident in any of the questions. Comparisons  between workship choices and achievement did not appear significant except in the case of white isolate children who were found to have achievement scores six months above grade level. Patterns of friendship, leadership, and workship choices were found to be dependent on sex, although open classrooms had more cross-sex choosing than standard classrooms. (Author)",

This role is primarily to stimulate, broaden, and provide focus to the exploration of self in relation to career. To effectively implement this role, test publishers must devote much more attention to transforming test scores (data) into counseling information. It is suggested that more than information is needed to obtain real benefit from tests. Counselors must help students transform the information obtained from tests into exploratory activities and self-evaluated experiences. For this reason, test interpretation can no longer be treated as a hot-house experience devoid of the real world. Career development and  decision-making principles indicate that tests must be used in the context of a developmental career guidance program. When this is done, tests can play a vital role in career guidance. (Author/CK)",

While the various school effectiveness indices differed from one another and in their correlations with other variables, little evidence could be found for the lack of validity of any school effectiveness index. Further, all of the  school effectiveness indices were highly stable across samples, except for the indices for initially high-scoring students. Finally, predictions from nonlongitudinal data furnished reasonable estimates of school effectiveness as measured by one of the indices. (Author/CK)",

These data suggest that the inverted student distribution may provide a better description of distributions of test scores than does the normal. (Author)",

This is the Impulsive stage. The next stage is the Ritual-hedonistic stage, in which controls are supplied by ritual observances, and reward and punishment remain important sanctions. The next stages include the Conformist stage, at which the child accepts the rules of the group; the Conscientious stage, at which he evaluates for himself which rules he shall follow; and the Autonomous stage, at which he tolerates ambiguity.

These facts are discussed for their implications for models of intelligence, the use of intelligence tests in infancy, and finally intervention programs. It is concluded that the implicity model of general intelligence rests upon its function for society rather than its scientific merit.

Students were grouped on the basis of high scores on the various college major scales reported on the KOIS and on the self-expressed interest in college majors reported on their NMSQT answer sheets. Means and standard deviations of NMSQT scores of each group were calculated and compared. Both statistically and practically significant differences were found in the mean NMSQT scores of groups showing interests in common college majors. Students choosing or having high interest scores in majors such as mathematics, English and physical science showed consistently higher scores  than those in agriculture and physical education. There was evidence that self-perception of ability influences choice of college major, and that tables could be developed showing the academic competition likely to be encountered in various fields.

The criterion items also included manipulative content, emphasizing the graphic solution of kinematics problems. Relevant technical literature was reviewed, and technical experts consulted. The analytical methods and guidelines used to determine program content, to discover strengths and weaknesses, and to determine the effectiveness and efficiency of the program have proven to be  effective. Conclusions include: (1) Content for self-instructional programs can be determined by identifying a domain of criterion items and selecting those items appropriate for a specified target population; and (2) The inclusion of randomly selected test items in the self-instructional program indicates to the student what is expected of him in the manner of his response to terminal criterion items.

The instrument design was that of Stake and Gooler, which suggests important variations in respondent publics, the scales employed, and the specificity of the statements. These variations were confirmed. A diverse group of respondents was interviewed. The validity of the instrument was deemed to be high except that it did not detect an underlying dissatisfaction. Technical and substantive results of the field test are discussed. Caution is suggested in gathering data from the general public. (Author)",

        "description":"A series of studies on observer biases revealed that simply informing observers of experimental hypotheses does not produce observational data consonant with those hypotheses. However, questionnaire responses following an experiment with different induced expectations does produce global data consonant with experimental hypotheses. In addition, if the observers are informed of the experimental hypotheses and the investigator provides daily feedback to the observers indicating how well their data support his hypotheses, the observers will report data consonant with those hypotheses. The method of investigation in the studies reported involved having observers watch specially prepared video tapes of children who exhibited significant amounts of disruptive behavior. Following a  pre-treatment or baseline period, observers were then asked to watch video tapes on which children displayed no change or marked reductions in disruptive behavior during a \"treatment period.\" While observer biases per se did not result in confounded data in any of the studies, an unanticipated problem of observer drift or changing observational criteria can result in seriously confounded data where groups of observers initially trained together are later assigned to different treatment conditions.

Data files will be maintained in a central locked office, with restricted access. Initial assessment of the teacher will take into account the following factors: (1) vision, hearing and speech, (2) academic ability, (3) academic performance, (4) adjective self description (ASD), (5) self-report inventory (SRI), (6) one-word sentence completion (OWSC), (7) directed imagination (DI), (8) biographical information (BIO),  and (9) concerns of teachers. Final assessment covers the following: (1) teacher evaluation form (TEF), (2) student evaluation of teacher (SET), and (3) exit interview form. The primary purpose of the entire system is the enhancement of the value of the teacher education experience to the individual students who go through the program. Other aspects of the system include services to students, retention/termination decisions, services to faculty and administration, and adjunctive research oriented procedures. (CK)",

Bits and pieces of research throughout the country are entombed in DISSERTATION ABSTRACTS INTERNATIONAL and university libraries. The ERIC/IRCD staff, believing that much could be learned about doctoral research itself, about children, and about educational programs, decided to attempt to provide comprehensive collections of abstracts in those areas of special interest to the Center. This document is one of several being prepared for a new series of publications entitled ERIC/IRCD Doctoral Research Series. The first step taken was to do a computerized search of the available tapes  of DISSERTATION ABSTRACTS INTERNATIONAL from 1965 to 1969 employing the following special descriptions: black, Puerto Rican, inner city, ghetto, Negro, disadvantaged; and others. The computer printouts of the resultant lists were then screened to eliminate all except those abstracts which clearly related to educational programs for the disadvantaged. A hand search was then conducted for documents appearing in the January 1970 to June 1972 volumes to bring the collection as up to date as was possible at that time. Each collection is organized in the following way. Documents are first under main topics. Under the main headings abstracts are presented in order of year of completion. Where a number of abstracts appear under a topic and in the same year, they are then arranged in alphabetical  order by name or author. (Author/JM)",

In addition, instructional assistance was available through the local Comprehensive Instructional Program to assist the faculties in implementing their programs. The nongraded instructional program at Reynolds School, incorporating the team teaching concept, was developed specifically to attempt to meet the identified needs of the pupil population. The Robinson School program was directed toward developing and improving the reading skills of the pupils  in the elementary grades. A secondary focus was a new experimental approach toward individualizing mathematics. At C.W. Hill School seeking approaches to raise the performance levels of the pupils was a major concern of the staff. Based on the rationale that early development of basic reading skills is very important to future success, grades one through three were chosen for indepth study. Special emphases were also placed on the lowest achievers since special activities in reading were planned to improve their performance. (Author/JM)",

The 1971-72 Project activities served a total of 243 students--117 boys and 126 girls. Approximately 68 percent of these participants remained in the project for the entire school year. Project operations integrated changes in both the content and the organization of instruction. A key element was the involvement of students in production-oriented workshops. Work experiences for girls were developed in a combination food-and clothing laboratory. Work experience for boys utilized an industrial arts shop with modifications in equipment and  materials. As a motivating element, participants in the project received 50 cents per hour for one hour per day for the work done in the project workshop. The total amount per pupil was $2.50 per week, approximately $45.00 for the semester. Class sizes were reduced with a maximum enrollemnt of 20 students per project class. In order to provide close supervision and individualized attention, a teacher's aide divided his time between the class of boys and the class of girls in each of the five schools. Academic instruction was integrated in a four-period block. (Author/JM0",

        "description":"The objectives of the Nutritional Improvement Project were as follows: children will attend school regularly; children will develop a receptive attitude toward school; children will increase in level of achievement. Cleveland Public Schools for the past four and one-half years have provided breakfast for all elementary pupils attending Title I, 1965 Elementary Secondary Education Act, schools. In 1971-72 school year, approximately 37,000 students in 58 schools were served breakfast every day. All pupils in grades from kindergarten through six in the 58 Title I schools were offered breakfast at the beginning of each school day between 8:40 and 9:00 a.m. Pupils ate breakfast in their classroom with Breakfast Aides servicing four rooms by distributing the food, supervising the  collection of all disposables and clearing the classrooms prior to the start of the school day. The Breakfast Aides who were hired from among applicants residing in the school neighborhood, worked an average of three hours per day. For the past five years there has been a continuing trend of lower attendance in Title I and non-Title I schools. However the Title I schools receiving breakfast did not experience as great a decline in attendance between 1967-68 and 1970-71, and in 1971-72 showed a slightly greater gain in attendance than recorded in the near-poverty area elementary schools.

The Project sponsored a five-day long resident school-oriented camping program which attempted to offer an integrated balance of typical learning experiences and the natural phenomena which exist in the real world. In addition, it provided unique experiences of learning how to live with one another, of developing attitudes and skills for problem-solving, developing understanding and tolerance of others, etc. The School Camping Program served a total of 3,010 fifth and sixth grade pupils from 53 Title I, 1965 Elementary Secondary Education Act schools during the 1971-72 school year.  Ninety teachers were involved in the Project as they accompanied their respective homeroom classes to the program. Approximately 120 pupils and four teachers from three schools, representing varied geographical locations attended the Project weekly. The program of instruction and the curriculum at the Project were structured in such a manner that it would extend typical school-associated learnings. Activities were included to enhance language and reading, social studies, mathematics, and science skills. (Author/JM)",

The project was designed to provide additional resources to supplement classroom learning experiences through employing college students to tutor elementary and secondary students on a regular weekly schedule. It was hoped that the availability of tutoring service would provide students with the following: immediate tutorial service when learning difficulties become apparent; reinforcement in basic skill areas; opportunity for personal relationships with adults. During the 1971-72 school year,  the Resident Tutor Project supplied tutors for 3,538 students in 68 elementary schools and in one junior and one senior high school in the Cleveland Public School system. In addition, 408 students in 21 non-public elementary schools and two non-public senior high schools received project services. During the summer school of 1972, 4,244 students in Grades One through 12 received tutoring service in the Cleveland Public Schools. No non-public schools were served in the summer. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This paper presents a series of modifications in technique and procedure in the general area of group therapy developed to meet the needs of a unique client group. The varied material brought together here are derived essentially from the study of a group of mothers formed by the leader in January 1971, after some two years of experience with a fairly typical Puerto Rican mothers group in a school on the elementary level in East Harlem. Such aspects as the length of sessions, media of communication, initial group and individual resistance for economic, social, and/or cultural reasons, and planful use of the therapist's feelings toward client movement from insight to change, as well as the manipulation of certain environmental factors, are considered in this study. Among the  features which most strikingly differentiated the group of mothers studied from any privately composed group were the lack of selectivity of members based on screening for diagnosis and the inherent limitations set thereby on range, balance, and preconsideration of likely group dynamics, since all members, generally of depressed social and economic means, had to have young children with behavior and/or learning problems, and only the most disturbed of those who volunteered might be kept out of the group.

Chapter two describes an index developed for measuring residential segregation which has been adapted for use as a measure of school segregation. Chapter three presents population data for Detroit  over the past 70 years. Changes in the numbers of students and faculty of different races between 1960 and 1970 are presented. Chapter four describes the index of dissimilarity values for students on an annual basis from 1960 to 1970. Chapter five repeats the description in Chapter four, with instructional personnel as subjects. Chapter six analyzes the distribution of instructional resources to schools according to the racial composition of their student bodies. Chapter seven concludes the report with a summary of findings and a brief evaluation of Detroit's progress toward desegregation. (Author/JM)",

The District Court denied the further relief, holding that the deliberate racial segregation of the Park Hill Schools did not prove a like segregation policy addressed specifically to the core city schools and requiring petitioners to prove de jure segregation for each area that they sought to have desegregated. The court nevertheless found that the segregated core city schools were educationally inferior to &quot;white&quot; schools elsewhere in the district and ordered the respondents to provide  substantially equal facilities for those schools. This latter relief was reversed by the Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court held that: (1) the District Court, for purposes of defining a &quot;segregated&quot; core city school, erred in not placing Negroes and Hispanos in the same category and (2) the courts below did not apply the correct legal standard in dealing with petitioners' contention that respondent School Board had the policy of deliberately segregating the core city schools.

        "description":"Equal education and open housing have become issues of an increasingly serious concern throughout the Nation. American communities are beset by the complexity of those interrelated problems that inexorably indicate inequality for minority citizens. In response to this, the Iowa State Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights held a closed meeting to investigate the problems of Waterloo, Iowa. It was felt that this investigation would clarify and perhaps present solutions not only for the serious situation in Waterloo, but for similar communities throughout the country. Waterloo is a medium-size conservative midwestern city with the second largest black population in Iowa. Its black population is strong, with a diversity of income, power, and ability. The advantage,  however, remains with the established system which can, by the release or suppression of crucial information, frustrate the efforts of volunteer groups seeking to alleviate the status quo. Waterloo citizens reported that the city's supply of safe, sanitary housing is inadequate. This is especially true for the poor and minorities. The urban renewal figures, which indicate that more than 50 percent of Waterloo's black population lives in substandard housing, reflect this. Studies of the Waterloo schools indicate a reluctance on the part of the system to provide an adequate and equal education for the black students in the community. This failure to confront and correct an obvious problem inevitably adds to the city's racial strife. (Author/JM)",

Career education will, for the first time, give young people a sense of control over their own destiny, give them a chance to shape their own lives in systematic ways, and give them sufficient solid information and experience to make it work. Occupational inequality is spread across the population: career education is needed for every American, whatever  his or her color, native language, age or location. It is needed in particular for the 2.5 million young people who spill out of our high schools and colleges every year unskilled and unschooled, prepared only to disappear into our broadening, deepening pool of the unemployed, the underemployed, and the disillusioned. In a society such as ours, which prizes and rewards skill and competence above all else, there is simply no need--and no room--for the unskilled and the incompetent, whatever color they happen to be. A properly designed, well financed program of career education can turn this situation around. (Author/JM)",

It attempts to evaluate the effects of cooperative efforts--between personnel of Vocational Rehabilitation and the Division of Family Services--to intervene in the poverty/dependence cycle of selected disabled welfare applicants and/or recipients. Between the years of 1963 and 1967 the Federal office of Vocational Rehabilitation provided funding for a total of 27 Research and Demonstration projects for the purpose of exploring ways and means for vocationally rehabilitating disabled welfare recipients and/or applicants. The major or primary goal of each project--and this is perhaps worth emphasizing--was to intervene in the poverty/dependence cycle characterizing many recipients of public  assistance and, by provision of intensive health and rehabilitative services, to enable them to embark on economically independent and productive careers. Active participation in the country's labor market and consequent independence from public assistance grants were primary project goals--and thus among the primary evaluative criteria of the projects' effects. A second goal of the projects was to complete and analyze project data on the recipients and on the kinds, results, and costs of services provided to them. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Because of the effects of the various factors which influence pupil growth and development, and because of the innumerable input measures of a program (measures such as people, places, things, and strategies), the need exists to formulate a model for determining effectiveness and acceptability of a program, and, at the same time, to take into consideration the relative extent to which the factors and measures influence pupil growth and development. This report of pupil performance during the 1971-72 school year represents an application, for the second year, of a model designed to meet this need. The model can be used to identify the relative effectiveness and acceptability of pupil performance in grades two through seven in the Atlanta Public School System. Effectiveness is  defined as the degree that a program accomplishes its objectives or its predictions. Acceptability is defined as the level of performance obtained by the pupils in terms of norms or standards. Reading and arithmetic are the two programs incorporated in the profiles. This analysis of achievement in reading comprehension and in arithmetic computation, as measured by the Metropolitan Achievement Tests, focuses attention on pupil accountability, rather than on teacher accountability.

The Providence and Pawtucket Model Cities areas proved to be a source of frustration for the counselors involved due to the multiplicity of problems found there and the inadequacy of the usual Division of Vocational Rehabilitation couselor-client approach to problems. After several meetings with the Model Cities personnel, the format to the present project was conceived, and considered to be the best approach to meet the needs of the residents of the Model Cities areas. This demonstration project was an attempt to determine whether or not an intensive family rehabilitation effort would succed in Model Cities areas where previous attempts at implementing Vocational  Rehabilitation services were not totally successful. Counselors were to work with the family as a group rather than with individual family members. Along with this, counselors were to be trained in Behavior Modification techniques so that they would be the primary source of service for their clients as opposed to the traditional &quot;purveyor&quot; of service approach. Since the project was terminated at an early stage in its implementation, there is no empirical data on which to base judgments of effectiveness. By December 1971, problems of instrumentation and treatment delivery appeared to have been coped with. Counselors were beginning to observe behavioral changes in some of their clients. (Author/JM)",

A panel study was done of twenty-eight pre-service teachers in a team-taught, competency-based program, an extension of a cooperative arrangement between four senior high schools and three junior high schools in Oakland, California and the Teacher Education Department, Secondary, of California State University, Hayward. Fourteen, constituting a group called the \"experimental student teachers,\" were trained during a two-week micro-teaching workshop, during the summer prior to starting the program, in the skill of reinforcement. The  remaining fourteen, constituting a group designated as the \"control student teachers,\" did not have this training. All other variables were controlled as much as possible. All student teachers had complete control of one class from the first day in the fall until school closed in June. Each student teacher administered pre and post inventories to the pupils in this class. Mean change scores were computed for each student teacher and a comparison of the two groups indicates that teachers who have been trained to use reinforcement may effect positive changes in their pupils' self-image, but have a negative effect on their pupils' attitude toward school.

Enrollments are down, the dropout rate among first and second year students remain high, and there is the issue of over-qualification. Of even more concern than over-qualification is under-qualification, as evidenced by the 2.5 million young people who leave high schools and colleges each year without marketable skills to enter an economy that increasingly looks toward specific competencies. Young people should be able to leave formal schooling at any level with a solid, marketable skill. The concept of career education is offered as a means of acquainting children in the early grades with the many broad career fields open to them so that they may have the opportunity to explore career  fields through their junior high school years and have a career goal by the time they reach high school. Should they elect post secondary education, they must make the eventual transition from high school with definite ideas concerning their careers. Post secondary institutions must increase their adaptability for providing continuity of career education programs for students initiated in high school. (SB)",

        "description":"This study was conducted to delineate some of the characteristics of disabled clients which contribute significantly to success in vocational programs. The performance of disabled persons in three types of vocational settings (college, skill training, and work evaluation/work experience samples) was examined to determine if the factors contributing to objective measures of success varied as a function of the program demands or the clinet/student's initial abilities. An additional part of the project was devoted to a follow-up of clients who had been placed in employment in order to gauge their long-term stability and factors which potentially relate to their maintenance of employment. The 82 subjects were interviewed and observed in their programs and assessments were made of  their: (1) work assets, (2) goals, (3) disability, (4) degree of interpersonal support from family and friends, (5) attitude toward disability, (6) interpersonal dominance, (7) locus of control, (8) ability to manage others, and (9) performance in the vocational setting. The over-all results were interpreted to mean that success for disabled persons is determined by different factors over the long process of vocational readiness. Criteria of success early in training are advancement to better training, and this requires job skills and a positive attitude toward work. However, later success requires the additional factor of emotional stability. (SB)",

To interest students in technological and vocational education and to dispel the prejudices against it, the new law provides for better dissemination of information about careers in industry, technology, and the crafts. Other provisions of the law: (1) require that equivalencies be established between diplomas in general academic courses and those in programs of technological and vocational education, (2) state that all teachers of general academic subjects are to enjoy the same professional status whether they teach in academic  high schools or technical schools, (3) provide for skilled workers and technicians to receive teaching leave during which they may give courses of instruction, (4) define the role of apprenticeships, (5) provide for career education programs to be offered in two phases--one before students complete formal education and one on a periodic basis after students leave school, and (6) require that industry share a part of the costs of providing programs of continuing professional education. Following the discussion of the legislation are suggested research areas which may be of interest to American educators. (SB)",

What these qualifications are and how much they vary from state to state is information of much concern to vocational educators. This study sought to identify the differences and similarities in trade and industrial education certification requirements at the secondary and post-secondary level in all of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Questionnaires were used to obtain the data. Findings revealed that: (1) At both educational levels, the emphasis was upon work experience rather than formal education for the beginning teacher. While some states required some formal education, many required  little or no professional teacher training, (2) Post-secondary teacher qualification was patterned after requirements for secondary teachers in most states; however, in post-secondary technical programs, technical knowledge took precedence over years of job experience in many states. Teacher qualification requirements at the post-secondary level were generally less specific than secondary requirements, possibly to allow more latitude in teacher recruitment and preparation.

The certificate may also be shown to employers to document good conduct. This study was undertaken to examine and analyze the actual benefits that ERC holders have received in getting jobs. All 700 ERC holders and a sample of those who inquired about the certificate were surveyed by mail and a few interviews were conducted with employers, program and service personnel, and ex-servicemen.  It was found that holders of the ERC have obtained few benefits in seeking and retaining employment. The ERC apparently brings no special job counseling or placement assistance, and holders are frequently reluctant to show it to employers. Only 11 percent of ERC holders reported that the certificate helped them to get jobs. It was concluded that a man visiting an employment office with an ERC will obtain exactly the same help he would obtain without it. (MF)",

The inadequacy of the present vocational counseling and guidance service offered secondary students was supported by these results: (1) Less than 60 percent of either group were able to identify a career choice, (2) Less than half of those who did identify a career choice were able to identify or describe the job cluster to which the career belonged, and (3) Less than 25 percent of the two groups were able to identify or give requested information about two community agencies providing job placement services.

        "description":"Project CAREER is a federally funded program to develop computerized behavioral objectives which will have relevance for career education in the 15 Office of Education occupational clusters for a multi-faceted approach in teaching marketable skills. The computerized data bank will be made available to all Massachusetts school systems. One element of this project is Project CAREER/Handicapped, which is assembling data based on the six major groups identified as handicapped: mentally retarded, blind, emotionally disturbed, hearing impaired, physically impaired, and speech impaired. In examining the approximately 17,000 behavioral objectives validated by Project CAREER, Project CAREER/Handicapped ascertained that every skill could be taught to handicapped students. Use of the data  bank is illustrated by the behavioral objective and lesson plan for a particular skill, that of changing oil and oil filter, which represents the occupational cluster identified as transportation and the occupational area demonstrated as automotive, with the occupation using the skill as service station attendant. When handicapped students are regarded as productive persons capable of learning and applying marketable skills, rather than as individual with special needs, the label or grouping of &quot;handicapped&quot; loses its significance and should be eliminated from the educational system.

Department of Labor's occupational analysis and job structuring procedure was adapted by project staff with the assistance of the Ohio Bureau of Employment Service and the U. S. Department of Labor, Occupational Analysis Division. Six teams, each consisting of a trained occupational analyst and an occupational therapist, observed and recorded duties and tasks performed by staff members of 15 selected facilities throughout the U. S. The lists of duties and tasks were assessed by 63 occupational therapy educators and practitioners to identify missing activities or delete non-relevant activities. During a job restructuring conference, the duties and tasks assessed by the educators and  practitioners were divided into four job levels based on the educational and vocational level of training needs for each duty and task. In addition, job descriptions were developed for each of the job levels, which included: (1) occupational therapy aide, (2) occupational therapy technician, (3) occupational therapist, and (4) occupational therapy consultant. This publication contains a chart indicating the division of responsibility for each level, along with a narrative summary of each job description and a detailed description of each level with its activities and elements.

Detailed cost figures for various instructional television delivery systems are provided in charts, tables, and models. The representative case studied in detail was the delivery of both vocational education services and general educational services to the Appalachian States. Various instructional television delivery systems were compared and consideration given to the need for local replay and production capability.  Instructional television can deliver course material to a large general education audience and to the dispersed and specialized vocational education audience simultaneously, with the combined cost comparable to teacher delivery of general education courses alone. It was found that satellite direct reception is the least expensive system. Video tape replay capabilities could provide flexibility at reasonable cost. Additional studies are recommended on a range of topics important for understanding the role of telecommunications in the regional delivery of health, education, and welfare services. (MF)",

        "description":"The paper discusses the need for career development programs for junior high school students and looks at career education modeling. There appears to be some consensus that the self-concept theory should give direction to career education planning. An interesting characteristic of the career education movement is the multiplicity of models which have been developed. Two models are specifically examined: (1) the national school-based Comprehensive Career Education Model, which provides a matrix linking 8 themes and 13 grades, and (2) the Wisconsin Model, which provides a scope-and-sequence chart for 16 basic concepts. The transitional years of the junior high educational level provide some unique opportunities to relate to the career development of youth. With a focus on the  student as an individual and based on sound career development theory, programs of career exploration can meet a significant need. Career awareness and exploration are closely intertwined and continue throughout life. Occupational clusters and career objectives developed in both models are further discussed. The paper concludes that although career exploration may appropriately be emphasized as a program activity for junior high students, other aspects of career education must also be treated.

        "description":"Drug rehabilitation programs in New York City encompass every form of treatment modality to be found in the field. As of September 1972, approximately 50,000 addicts were being treated. Estimates of the total number of addicts in New York City range from 150,000 to 300,000. There is little coordination among the various governmental and private treatment agencies, and they all compete for the same funds. The majority of New York City addicts and ex-addicts come from minority groups, with low academic achievement, low job skills, and often with a criminal history. This is the principal target population for in-treatment and post-treatment educational and occupational concerns. Two models for an interface among education, employment, and treatment are presented, one for an  occupational and educational information referral service for treatment programs and the other for an employment service. The delivery system for the two models would be an independent nonprofit agency designed to serve as an intermediary between the treatment programs and the educational and occupational institutions. Relevant data would be handled by a computer system and suggestions for implementation are given along with an estimated budget. (MF)",

It is emphasized that the model described is not a curriculum model but a conceptual model arrived at through a deductive process that will permit the ordering of content and knowledge about the world of work. A model concept is that occupational establishments and individual occupations have evolved to meet three primary cultural imperatives: replenishment, management and maintenance, and transmission. The world of work is defined in terms of  the sum total of the occupational establishments. The designation of two types of work makes it possible to treat work, as a curriculum development construct, in terms of Worker Functions (what people do) and Worker Traits (worker requirements and qualifications). This description and structure for the world of work is intended to stimulate curriculum development activities. A related document is available as ED 060 198. (Author/MF)",

From this theory it is seen that self formation is a developmental process which takes place within the social system. The individual's inferences from his social behavior define his self-concept, and a self-concept which has career relevance is the functional self. Like any self-concept, the functional self is a self-process, a process of being and becoming. It is the developmental process of the functional self that should enable curriculum writers to develop a process career developmental curriculum, rather than a content occupational information curriculum. Career development is not obtaining knowledge in preparation for living but rather a process of experiencing living.  (Author/MF)",

The employers also thought that the public schools' curriculum should be  oriented more toward the community and its employment opportunities. Recommendations based on the study findings included an extensive public relations program, improving vocational courses in all State public schools, and developing policies and plans at the Nebraska Vocational-Technical School for greater utilization of the business and industrial community in program change and expansion of the cooperative education program.

The assessment was directed toward finding methods which would serve to solve the problems causing the concerns. Some of the recommendations which were arrived at, include: (1) More efforts should be made by educational institutions and personnel throughout the State to make the public more aware of opportunities in occupational education, (2) Educators should act to redefine occupational education and expand it so as to  emphasize manual skills, (3) Attempts should be made to widen the scope of the curriculum, (4) More should be done to provide early vocational guidance and programs should be redesigned or reoriented to fit the needs of all students, (5) Policies should be adopted that aid in the operation of programs, (6) New approaches to funding should be considered, (7) Federal and state governments should coordinate their programs to aid in manpower development, (8) Existing laws governing teacher certification should be redrafted, (9) More cooperation between the Council and Board of Regents is indicated.

Procedures followed to implement these goals are detailed for the elementary, junior high, and senior high schools and for the Community Career Center for school dropouts and other out-of-school persons. Accomplishments included in-service programs for teachers, special vocational programs for the secondary grades, and the operation of a drop-in center for dropouts to offer information on educational and occupational  planning.

Evaluation activities are divided into the components of management, in-service, and program. Under each component a number of evaluation activities are discussed. For the most part, evaluation consisted of documenting that the program was operational and that the staff was implementing proposal project strategies. Based upon meetings with the project staff, site visits at the project schools, and review of the quarterly reports the evaluation team concluded that the project was well  managed and that staff were generally familiar with and committed to project goals. It was found that, in practice, career education and environmental education were taught as separate entities. Teachers rated their experiential activities (e.g., shop experience) highly.

A definition of educational quality was developed from a literature search and from a survey of teacher-educators and supervisory personnel. Principals of 54 secondary schools identified as having vocational education programs with quality characteristics were sent forms to be completed by their guidance counselors and teachers. Each respondent indicated the elements that he considered important to quality. From these data 20 quality components were established and 60 evaluative items (3 to measure each component) were developed to evaluate vocational programs. These items were then made part of an analysis of the degree of correlation between  specific programs and the consensus &quot;quality&quot; program. Research teams collected data during site visits to 18 representative schools selected from the initial 54. Summaries of the responses and copies of the forms used are appended, along with a detailed analysis of all of the data. It was recommended that the proposed model be used in evaluating all vocational education programs in Tennessee and that graduates of these programs be followed up to keep the programs current.

The task bank is an outgrowth of the application of systems approach and functional job analysis to agency management. Individualized data banks for specific tasks were developed by local agencies and each task was described on a Keysort card. The cards for all of the tasks provided a means of manipulating data at the operating level. Among the potential uses of the data bank are: (1) exchange of information among States, (2) planning for training and educational needs, (3) national program planning, (4) State manpower planning, and (5) standardization of language used to describe  worker activities. As the initial input was relatively small, operations were begun in a manual mode rather than attempting to develop a more expensive automated system. The future of the program will depend on State and local agency activities in the area of functional job analysis, resulting in the generation of task statements, and on continued financial and administrative support from the Social and Rehabilitation Service.

Analysis of data from 550 students indicated that none of the 21 student characteristics investigated served as a denominator to separate those students who will express the same occupational choice throughout the secondary years from those who will not. The best indicator of stability of occupational choice throughout high school appeared to be stability of occupational choice from ninth to tenth grades. Of those students who chose the same occupation in both ninth and tenth grades, two thirds of them continued to choose the same occupation at twelfth  grade. Several other student characteristics which increase the chances of stability of occupational choice include success in terms of grade point average, enrollment in a vocational curriculum, and vocational maturity. The student's socioeconomic background, sex, or level of occupational choice do not have an effect on stability of occupational choice. (Author/SB)",

The study population was all possible adult deaf in the State of Oregon. The criteria for selection were: between 24 and 54 years old, with a pure tone hearing loss of at least 50 decibels in their unaided superior ear, and employable for three years prior to being contacted for inclusion in the study. A total of 483 adult deaf participated in the study. The tests used were the General Aptitude Test Battery, Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test, Hearing Loss, Weingarten  Picture Inventory, Closure Flexibility (Gottschaldt) Test, Gates Reading Survey, Craig Lipreading Inventory, Oregon Manual Communication Test, Berger Block Test, and Holdt Speech Characteristics Test. Norms for employable deaf adults for the tests used are provided. A minimum test battery is supplied. Results of the study show that the adult deaf participate cooperatively in research programs, are less competitive than the hearing population, show wide individual differences, differences among the employable deaf in personal history and test behavior are related to differences in work adjustment, and vocational adjustment is facilitated by identifying practical occupational objectives. Fifty tables provide the study data, and 39 plots are given of profiles of subject and test score  variables. The report concludes with 14 appendixes and 154 references. (DB)",

        "description":"This project undertook to demonstrate the effectiveness of a counseling and community services center for deaf people in a metropolitan area. The experiment was based on the need to broaden the service base for deaf people, many of whom are not aware of or not able to make adequate use of regular community service facilities because of the problems of communication and rapport. The serious consequences of underservice on the well-being of deaf individuals have long been recognized. This project, therefore, is providing an important opportunity to demonstrate techniques whereby community services available to the general population may be made more available to deaf persons. The specific objectives of this research and demonstration program are as follows: (1) to increase the use  of community services by the deaf population through imparting information to deaf persons on the availability of appropriate community services, to provide support to deaf clients so that they are likely to use these services, and to provide consultation and interpreting services to these agencies in order to bring optimum benefits to deaf clients; (2) to develop new and more effective resources in the community to serve deaf people, such as rehabilitation facilities, mental health facilities, and others; (3) to provide direct counseling services to deaf clients where outside community services are not available; (4) to establish a program of adult education for deaf people designed to reduce the need for special services either within the counseling center or in outside agencies; and  (5) to provide for the training of personnel working with deaf people.

It was sponsored by the International Association of Rehabilitation Facilities, and was supported by grant from the Social and Rehabilitation Service, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Speakers at the meeting were federal and state officials of rehabilitation and welfare programs and representatives of organizations in the private sector that rely extensively on the talents of volunteer workers to improve and expand services for disabled and needy people. Program highlights included: (1)  descriptions of a number of programs that now use volunteers to help serve poor and handicapped people, (2) the federal view of present programs and future prospects in the use of volunteers, (3) discussions of the psychosocial, economic, and legal aspects of voluntarism, (4) a personal view by an experienced volunteer, and (5) a look at new directions that voluntarism is taking and is expected to take as the field expands, especially in rehabilitation programs, which are not well established in utilizing volunteers as are public welfare programs.

        "description":"The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the value of establishing an operations research program within a state vocational rehabilitation agency. To reach the objectives of the project, a research director was employed in the South Carolina Vocational Rehabilitation Department (1) to stimulate and coordinate research activities throughout the state by (a) organizing a panel of research consultants, (b) conducting research conferences, (c) stimulating research by personal visits, and (d) providing consultation to other agencies; (2) to encourage the utilization of research findings by (a) conducting a systematic review of pertinent material and (b) communicating significant research and demonstration results to field personnel; and (3) to conduct research and demonstration  activities within the State Vocational Rehabilitation Program through (a) statistical and follow-up research and (b) operations research studies of rehabilitation programs. The program proved to be of value particularly in developing strategies for utilizing research findings in program and staff development. The value of such a program is influenced by the interest of the administrators and supervisors in improving their programs, the level position held by the Research Director, his prior positions and rehabilitation experience, his understanding of personal and organizational growth, his set of interests and values, and the relationships he develops with the training staff, state and local supervisors, service personnel, and consultants.

        "description":"A project to demonstrate and evaluate some innovative programs utilizing volunteers in work with the handicapped and to provide data on the success of present programs is discussed. As part of the project, four pilot projects were undertaken to determine the feasibility and utility of certain approaches and to develop model training courses that could be taught to volunteers in general or to college student volunteers. The four pilot projects were: (1) a project to introduce handicapped persons into Junior Achievement companies as a means of developing and modifying attitudes on the part of program directors and co-workers; (2) training of volunteers in behavior management techniques to determine whether the behavioral problems arising from handicapped interactions, especially  those having to do with excessive dependency and claims for support could be managed with modern behavior management methods; (3) the teaching of behavior management techniques to supervisors at Goodwill Industries to assist with worker &quot;motivation&quot; and &quot;cooperation&quot; problems; and (4) the training of parents of underprivileged children in a day-care center in the management of child behavior. The results of these pilot projects showed that volunteers did not differ substantially from nonvolunteers in attitude or personality, as measured by test. It was also found that the attitude of volunteers toward the handicapped did not improve with experience. In the Junior Achievement groups, experience may make attitudes more negative or more realistic. Students can be successfully utilized as  volunteers. Integrating the handicapped with volunteers in social-recreational settings has positive benefits. (DB)",

Twenty-five state Extension sheep specialists were contacted by mail questionnaires. At least some information was returned by those in 23 states. Responses to all items were given by 16 state specialists. Other data were secured by means of library research, personal letters, and interviews. The numbers of sheep in the states studied and in the United States had decreased rapidly since 1900. However, the degree of the decrease was seen to have  varied from state to state. Study findings showed that Extension Animal Science Specialist, Extension Livestock Specialist, and Extension Sheep (or Wool) Specialist were, in that order, the most frequently mentioned titles of specialists. Only three states (Kansas, Tennessee, and Wyoming) provided job descriptions. These descriptions are provided in an appendix to this report. The questionnaire data are provided in 13 tables.

For each of these cities, the following information was sought: (1) how much money Government agencies were spending on narcotic treatment and rehabilitation, (2) goals of the different programs, (3) methods of treatment, (4) number of patients in treatment, (5) services available, (6) cost of the different treatment methods, (7) criteria used to select patients, (8) extent of assessments of program performance, and (9) what was learned from these assessments. This report concerns narcotic addiction treatment and rehabilitation in New York City. It is a compilation of data supplied by city and state  officials and by officials of the various rehabilitation programs in New York City. Findings of the study showed that estimates of the number of addicts range from 115,000 to 300,000, that an estimated half billion dollars worth of property is stolen annually by addicts, and that about 1,400 deaths during 1972 were narcotics related. The city's approach to the problem is focused for the most part around its Addiction Services Agency, which is responsible for city-wide planning, management, evaluation, and innovation of treatment and rehabilitation projects. Information on 10 rehabilitation programs as to the program, its modality, and its goal, how a program participant is selected, number of people served by the program, whether there is a waiting list, program cost, who supplies the  money, how program performance is measured, and what the latest results show comprise this report.

Methods included counseling, groups, crisis intervention, cluster apartment living, social milieu, education, job-samples, recreation and meeting clients' needs through knowledge of community resources with active involvement and field work. The aim was to start positive snowballs. Then the aim was to keep them rolling. Comparisons between different groups and pre- and post-program functioning consistently showed improvement for graduates in terms of rehospitalization rates, employment, social functioning and  self-concept. The majority also were judged by staff to have attained objectives and made gains. Most clients require years to consolidate gains and develop further; thus, a program must endure itself if growth is to continue. By becoming part of a mental health center and taking advantage of relevant titles of the Social Security Act and DVR case costs, the program can survive and continue starting new clients and backing-up Graduates. Personal relations, comprehensive aid, persistence and opportunities for learning by doing are seen as essential aspects of effective psychiatric rehabilitation. (Author)",

During the first three months of precinct work following training, officers returned periodically for case conferences. The data collected at the beginning of and during a five-month evaluation were: (1) a course evaluation; (2) a structured telephone interview with  citizens, comparing trained and untrained officers; (3) an opinion questionnaire given trained officers four months into the project; and (4) demographic and descriptive information of interventions made by trained officers. Questionnaire data showed enthusiastic acceptance of the project by policy officers and appreciation of the techniques given them. Interview data showed that citizens were much more satisfied with the way trained officers dealt with them than they were with treatment from untrained officers. Demographic and descriptive data were used to develop background on the nature of family conflict and interpersonal aggression. (Author/KM)",

The goals of the School Volunteer Program are: (1) to lower the pupil-adult ratio in order to provide more supervision during the day and more individual help to pupils, (2) to assist the teacher in the use of multimedia materials and equipment by having a pool of skilled personnel available, (3) to enrich the existing instructional program by developing a cadre of community resource personnel, (4) to improve communication among members of a multi-ethnic  community by having bilingual individuals or groups available to the schools; (5) to help students in vocational programs gain knowledge of the kinds of jobs that are available in South Florida, (6) to increase the accuracy of school records and files by having available additional clerical personnel, (7) to improve the students' health by increasing the variety and extent of health services, and (8) to increase the number and effectiveness of volunteers through a public information and training program. The School Volunteer has worked basically in three areas: recruitment, training, and evaluation. Activities accomplished in these areas are discussed. A form to be used in evaluating a volunteer is provided. Background data of regular school volunteers, total volunteer hours by schools,  and volunteer services offered are tabulated. (DB)",

Other goals are to reinforce the instruction of the teaching staff with volunteers trained for particular service, to offer individual help to students, to make available the talents and resources of the community in order to supplement and enrich the educational program, and to broaden community understanding of school needs and problems. For this interim evaluation, 136 volunteers, 12 principals, and 3 directors were surveyed by use of interviews and questionnaires. The survey was designed to assess the respondents' perceptions of the project in meeting program objectives, as well as assess possible areas where activities and  resources could be used more effectively to improve volunteer performance. The seven project objectives are: (1) by use of volunteer tutors, to increase the reading achievement of poor readers by at least six months; (2) by use of volunteer tutors, to increase the understanding of basic concepts and mathematical proficiency, by at least four months, of students with poor mathematical aptitude; (3) teachers in classrooms where volunteers are assigned will increase the amount of time devoted to instructional activities by 20%; (4) use of the libraries and access to a library will increase; (5) teachers in special education classrooms will increase the amount of time devoted to instructional activities and individualized instruction as a result of volunteer help; (6) the number of volunteers  will increase by 50% during the first project year; and (7) community resource volunteers will volunteer their services. Activities to achieve these objectives are discussed. (DB)",

The BLADE Program raises adults to a measured Grade 5.0 level in reading, other communication skills, and mathematics. The program is completely individualized: it tells the student what he is to learn, provides the materials and dynamics for learning it, tells him how to use the instructional sequence, tells him how well he should learn the content, and gives him the means to determine if he has met these criteria before he is tested on his progress. The program is constructed to meet expressed behavioral objectives, and is sequenced on the spiral curriculum plan. The instructional materials are  original and designed specifically for the BLADE Program. They are adult in context. The 115 instructional books vary in size. The media include audiotapes, texts, study sheets, study cards, exercises, and some manipulative items. The two most unique features of the program are the tape-text combination and the cueing system. This manual discusses the units of Communication, Levels 1-4; non-Blade materials concerned with communication; Mathematics, Levels 1-4; non-Blade optional materials on mathematics; Facts for Effectual Living; Learning How to Learn; Timed Practice Sessions; Skill and Knowledge Required for Enrollment; Tests to Establish Suitability for Enrollment; The Entrance Levels; Tests for Placement in the BLADE Program; Special Skill and Activities Required of the Instructor;  The Classroom Kits of BLADE Material; Equipment Needed; Time Required to Complete the Program; and Implementing the Program in the BLADE classroom.

The following summarizes the system presented here: (1) Each Extension program will be evaluated by Form A; (2) Each faculty member who participated in the program (for 45 minutes or more) will be evaluated either by a short or long  form or by a jury of peers; and (3) Follow-up evaluations will be conducted to determine the long-range impact of extension programs.

The following studies were reviewed: (1) The White Study, (2) The Chamberlain Study, (3) The Aker Study, (4) The Veri Study. Using data from these four studies, a total of 125 competencies were identified. An attempt to arrange the competencies into a taxonomy resulted in the following major headings: Personal Attributes, Societal Affairs, Adult Education, Adults, and Programing. A 10-step process  for determining behavioral objectives is described. It is suggested that these objectives be used to design new learning experiences for learners. (CK)",

Holdout control subjects participated only after complete criterion data collection on all subjects. Measures were taken from personnel records on the increased self-development activities engaged in by subjects following treatments. These criterion measures were supplemented by followup interview and questionnaire data. Highly significant differences (p .001) were found in the increased number of self-development activities undertaken by  personnel at different hierarchical levels. Self-analysis and action planning appeared to be useful at higher (managerial) levels; no effects were found for middle-level personnel.

Two hypotheses were tested. Two groups were studied. The first group to undergo training was composed of 10 black women of ages ranging from 25 to 53 years; this was the control group. The second, experimental, group were 13 Black women  of similar background. Each group was pretested and posttested, using a communications exercise, a measurement of group members perceptions of the change agent, and a group cohesiveness scale.

Two hypotheses were tested: (1) Students with high self-esteem viewing the program as having low utility would be early dropouts; and (2) Among students viewing the program as having high utility, cognitive gain would be predicted by the level of self-esteem. A self-esteem instrument was administered verbally. Results are given.

The evaluation process is first considered from the viewpoint that it is an add-on activity, which is largely summative, and is the least desirable type of evaluation. Formative evaluation is next considered as a part of the process of institution building from the first step, which continues as an ongoing activity for the life of the institution, and is thus the most desirable evaluation process. Given the institutional concept and rationale for a new approach to the education of distant learners, including the over-all objectives to be achieved, a model of the new institution is projected. A conceptual matrix for building the correspondence institution is provided, which is  useful in modeling because it (1) identifies all the elements that must be dealt with, and (2) provides a way for builders to \"select the universe\" that they wish to work within. A tentative three-stage model, in which the learner roles become the active focus, is provided. A planning matrix for modeling a correspondence teaching and learning institution is presented, and an appendix provides a list of the quality control subsystems that may be useful in fleshing out a model for a correspondence institution.

The four major objectives of this experiment were: (1) to examine educational competition within a learning, as opposed to a testing, situation; (2) to examine competition using an experimental design, task, procedure, and setting which allow for generalization to present educational situations; (3) to reexamine the effect of educational competition on three dependent variables: performance, interest, and retention; and (4) to examine the difference between competition with a material reward and competition in a game situation without a material reward. Although interest was found to be significantly higher in  these treatments than in a control, neither performance nor retention was increased under the competitive treatments. Based on a review of the literature and the results of this study, a model relating task complexity and intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation to increased performance was proposed. (Author)",

A series of prison dilemmas, reflecting conflicts experienced by inmates and guards, was administered to 34 inmates; in addition, each inmate was given the standard Kohlberg moral maturity interview. Responses were scored for moral judgment and perception of moral atmosphere. Results indicate that the more primitive moral reasoning used in the prison dilemmas may be related to inmate perceptions of the moral atmosphere of the prison and that the traditional custodial prison fails to offer the inmate the conditions necessary to move him toward higher stages of thinking. The author feels that in order to substantially affect the inmates moral reasoning, communities must be provided  that stimulate his moral thinking and are perceived by him as fair.

Conceptualization was defined as generalization within and discrimination between classes and was assessed by having 176 undergraduate volunteers classify new positive and negative case studies after instruction from a definition and selected instances. Two, three-way analyses of variance followed by t-tests revealed that instance type, identifiability, and variety have differential effects on generalization and  discrimination.

        "description":"This paper examines the evolution of the student personnel function in higher education and particularly the uniqueness of the function of the Community College level. Some important factors which influenced the development of student personnel work in higher education are identified; the article then discusses the unique role of the community college as a segment of higher education. From the literature a symthesis of the theoretical objectives of student personnel work at the community college is presented, as well as objectives of actual programs at the community college level. These objectives are divided into three specific groups: 1) adjustive objectives which deal with necessary changes in student attitude or behavior as well as desirable environmental changes; 2)  distributive objectives involving the informational processes; and 3) adaptive objectives concerned with modification in institutional programs and activities to meet variability in student and community need.

This would be best accomplished by expanding the historical defintiion of curriculum to include: 1) knowledge in addition to, and other than, that provided by the disciplines; and 2) opportunities for the student to develop intelligence about his own unique self. The author sees the career education movement as providing a good opportunity for this development and feels that career education concerns can accommodate activities and purposes which are central to the fulfillment of the objectives of guidance. Career education must not be simply equated with education about jobs or with vocational-technical skill training; rather, it must be  regarded as a way of constructing the process of schooling, not merely its outcome.

        "description":"This research studies the effects of censoring a communication, overriding the censor, and the attractiveness of the censor on the potential audience's attitude and desire to hear the communication. The subjects, 144 undergraduate psychology students, were told that a speech which they were to have heard had been censored by a positively, negatively or neutrally evaluated group. Results indicated that regardless of the attractiveness of the censor, censorship caused the audience to change their attitudes toward the position to be advocated by the communication and to increase their desire to hear that communication. The effects are discussed as resulting from the arousal of psychological reactance, which decreased when the censor was overriden and behavioral freedom was restored.  Positively evaluated group censors changed subjects' attitudes away from the position advocated by the communication; negative group censors changed their attitudes toward the position of the communication. These results were interpreted as evidence of cognitive balancing. (Author/SES)",

The study attempted to alter impulsive behavior in terms of number of errors by training identified impulsive boys to use component parts of stimuli. The pretest, a modified version of the Matching Familiar Figures (MFF), was administered to 34 second grade boys; three sets of materials were used to train these subjects in analytic relationships, detail recall, and detail matching. Results indicate that pupils classified as impulsives can, through training in analysis, be conditioned to behave more reflectively in terms of reduction of errors, and that training in  analysis under conditions where time is allowed to vary does not lead to an increase in responding time.

The strategy included the development of a community-wide system for the periodic assessment of specific subpopulations in the community; one that would give basic information for program development. The intervention program for a total population was based on the assessment of both qualitative and quantitative characeristics of need, while evaluation of the program involved periodic reassessment of needs in the total population. The intervention program was refined in light of the  kinds and quantity of impact achieved by the program. Results of the study indicate that gaining and maintaining community sanction through citizen participation at both the policy-making and operational levels of human services is critical for the success of community wide programs.

While research efforts have generally been confined to a focus on general criminal or delinquent behavior of the individual, it appears that the theory may also be applied to specific criminal or delinquent acts such as marijuana use by the individual. A causal path model based upon Sutherland's theory was developed and operationalized with this emphasis. Two distinct processes of differential association (differential action association and differential attitude association) were suggested to explain the genesis of marijuana use for the individual. The data tended to lend support to the causal path model based upon Sutherland's theory of differential  association. References and tables are included. (Author)",

Previous administration of personality measures in two addiction treatment programs had revealed that successful and unsuccessful treatment subjects varied significantly on selected items of several evaluation instruments. Subjects prone to drop out of the programs prematurely were found to be more variable on these items than subjects whose attendance in the programs was stable. The findings held true for both a methadone maintenance program and a hypnotic-simulation therapy program, and the investigators concluded that the items formed a valid measure of addiction  treatment subject characteristics which could be used to type subjects according to stability and hence, need for intensified supportive counseling.

The author introduces a systems approach to the examination of sex stereotyping, using the CIPP evaluation model, and sketches briefly the relationship between this model and the problem of sex stereotyping. The paper further visualizes a school system and examines areas where institutionalized stereotyping may occur: in the formulation of goals and objectives; in the curriculum; in the allocation of such resources as time, money, staff, materials, and services; and in the teaching-learning situation itself. Finally, the paper argues the need for women in school administration posts; one, women need to be in positions  to make decisions which would lead to the elimination of sex-stereotyping in schools, and thus in the larger society; and two, women should be equated with authority in the eyes of school children to the same extent as men are.

Rather specific, extensive treatment is given to Merton's perspectives and conceptual formulations regarding perception and reference groups. Merton's theory that non-members do not constitute a single homogeneous social category is extensively discussed in light of three  variables: (1) eligibility-whether or not an individual is eligible to become a member; (2) orientation-how an individual views the group, i.e., positively, negatively or indifferently; and (3) membership-whether or not the non-member is oriented toward a closed or open group.

CVIS is of particular interest because it is the most comprehensive system, it has had the largest number of student users, the longest use span, and the largest number of installations. A unique and practical feature is that the system is easily transportable. School districts in all parts of the country have implemented the system and have formed a consortium to assist one another in  updating, revising and extending the system as well as validating available evaluation data on CVIS. CVIS not only provides a guidance function, but also includes counselor/administrative functions and computer-assisted instruction, which makes the program cost/effective.

The first two objectives were successfully met during the first two years of the study. A diversified battery was then developed for assessing these characteristics among children in the several countries. Volume II described results of applying that battery to 6,400 children in seven countries in 1965-1966. A revised battery was then applied to a new sample of 3,600 children in eight  countries during 1968-1969: England; Italy; Japan; Mexico; West Germany; Chicago and Austin, Texas, U.S.A. This volume, the fifth of seven, reports the findings from the 1968-1969 sample and compares them with the findings from the 1965-1966 sample. A cross-national analysis describes those characteristics which showed unique national patterns. The final section of this volume discusses some major implications of the findings for educational and social practice. (Author/CJ)",

The latter tests were based on selections and quizzes from the &quot;Controlled Reader Study Guides,&quot; which were also the principal materials used for instruction, each grade using the booklet intended  for one grade below its level. Results showed significant differences in the post-test mean raw scores on the Gates-MacGinitie Speed and Accuracy Tests at the eighth grade level only. On the informal speed test, however, significant differences appeared at all four grade levels, indicating effectiveness of the rate instruction as measured by a test similar to the instruction.

Sixty children from grades 1-3 with Spanish surnames were given the Gates-McKillop Reading Diagnostic Test to determine their oral reading performance. A bilingual speaker interviewed parents and scored A Language Background Scale. Spontaneous language responses were assessed by using the Children's Apperception Test. Seven selected subtests from the Illinois Test  of Psycholinguistic Abilities (ITPA), Revised Edition, were used to measure the subjects' language processing abilities in English. Some of the results indicated: (1) the sample was approximately at the normative mean in grade one and half a year below the mean in grade two in one school and in grade three in both schools; (2) different abilities become significant at different stages of the child's reading progress; and (3) children who experience more Spanish in the home tend to be lower in syntactic ability.

The first consideration is an assumption that comprehension skills are based on a set of underlying cognitive tasks or operations which can be developed through instruction. The second assumption is that instructional strategies for these cognitive tasks which are presented in an organized and systematic manner can facilitate children's competence in performing these cognitive tasks and, therefore, in performing the skills of reading comprehension. Two cognitive tasks, concept formation and interpretation of data, are used in this paper as the basis for planning critical reading instruction at the elementary  school level. Two structured lessons and discussions provide examples for teaching specific cognitive skill objectives and for allowing pupils to reach their own decisions, building cognitive skills through use.

The subjects were 79 children in four first grade classes. The Matching Familiar Figures Test was administered and scored by determining the average time to the first selection of a response and the total number of errors. Each child whose average response time was above the group median and whose number of errors was below the group median was classified as reflective. Each child whose average response time was  below the group median and whose number of errors was above the group median was termed impulsive. The results indicated that the reflective children made fewer miscues that differed from the text and fewer miscues of the most numerous category, word recognition. The reflective children self-corrected a greater proportion of their word-substitution miscues, specifically when their miscues were semantically inappropriate to the text and when they were syntactically inappropriate to the following portion of the sentence.

Sixth-six fourth grade pupils in a middle-class suburban community in central New Jersey were selected as subjects. A control group design was used and both groups spent approximately 20 to 30 minutes a day working at the exercises independently during seat work time, while the teacher conducted the regular basal reading instruction. Pretests and posttests were administered using alternate forms of the Gates Mac Ginitie Comprehension Test Level D. The main statistical analysis concerned comparison of mean scores for both groups. Statistical significance was  evaluated by the t test. The comprehension achievement of the top 27 percent and the bottom 27 percent of the pupils tested was also analyzed. All analyses showed no statistical significance at the .05 level between the means of the supplementary comprehension group and the supplementary vocabulary group. Also, no statistical significance could be established between the means of the high scoring pupils nor between the means of the low scoring pupils. (Author/WR)",

Ninth grade developmental students learned to appreciate more mature books than did students from regular classes; there was no difference between tenth grade students in both groups. There was a lack of dramatic difference between the two programs, which was partly due to the fact that the regular program was already  characterized by principles similar to those of the developmental program, such as individualized instruction and a student-centered curriculum. Some evidence was found that students from lower socioeconomic classes did less well on the developmental program than on the regular program, despite the fact that the developmental program was originally devised for these students.

A major difficulty with the product view seems to be that reading is treated as though it is stopped in time, captured in the static scores of tests. This feature of the product view will have to be dealt with to avoid misisomorphism between a product theory of reading and the complex, changing referent for that theory as it exists in process. The process view of reading is concerned with the total process of reading from beginning to end. Two important aspects of the process view are the author and the reader. The author's graphic output is the reader's graphic input. A communicative transformation occurs when the  reader, independent of the author, moves into the time and place conditions that permit sense perception of the author's graphic output. From the meaning, constructed, reconstructed, or both, the reader constructs knowledge. The analogies of meaning are in long term memory, fully available for intensive processing. (WR)",

Some of the reasons why newspapers have been bypassed in the schools are thay many people regard them as unreliable and sensational and that administrators and teachers continue to judge newspapers by what they were rather than what they are today. It is concluded that  newspapers today are more readable and more socially involved in readers' lives and that they present the \"why\" as well as the \"how\" of the news.

The first study investigated whether black children would evaluate Black English selections more favorably than standard English selections and whether favorable evaluation would lead to greater comprehension of the Black English selections. The subjects, 24 black and 24 white third grade students, used a seven-point semantic differential type scale to rate the stories. The results of the experiment showed that the black children rated the Black English materials as worse, less correct, and harder to read than the Standard English materials. The second study was conducted in the same manner as the first, but an auditory dimension was added by  playing the stories on a tape recorder. The stories were folk tales, and two more dialects were added, pidgin from Hawaii and Cajun from Louisiana. The findings indicated: (1) black children think that listening to the Black English story versions is better and more beautiful than white children do; (2) black children's comprehension of the Black English versions is better than their comprehension of stories in the other dialects; and (3) there was no difference between black and white children in their comprehension of spoken Standard English stories.

The first stage is a decoding stage in which the words are perceived and translated into an acoustic code, and the second stage is a semantic matching stage in which words were categorized into three phonological factors (word length, vowel complexity, and regularity) affecting only the decoding stage and two semantic component factors (word familiarity and concreteness) expected to affect the semantic matching stage only. An experimental session consisted of 6 blocks, 96 words altogether. Each block had two phases, a prefamiliarization or training phase followed by a test phase. Experiment 1, using second and fifth grade children, showed pictures and words; experiment 2, using first and third grade  children, varied the sentences that were read and the amount of pronunciation practice. Results indicated that the phonological prefamiliarization and word factors affected decoding but not semantic matching and that the semantic prefamiliarization factors affected semantic matching but not decoding. However, the semantic word factors affected both decoding and semantic matching, possibly as a result of final consonants and consonant clusters confounding semantic factors. (HOD)",

After completion of the six-week phase of the program, these classes returned to their home schools and entered the 150 day follow-up phase of the program. The pupils received approximately fifteen minutes of instruction each day on the Talking Typewriter. Information was presented to the children audibly and visually, and the Talking Typewriters responded to the children, providing a constant flow of responses. A random sample of six schools was selected to evaluate the program. Some of the results indicated that on the basis of  post-program reading vocabulary and reading comprehension scores better than one out of four pupils in the sample population narrowed the discrepancy between their performance levels and reading expectancies to 1.0 or less grade equivalent units. Average gain in comprehension grade equivalent units was 5 months in an average service period of 25.46 days. It was recommended that the Talking Typewriter Program continue. (WR)",

To determine what reasoning tasks we ask the child to perform when we ask him to analyze printed words so that he can pronounce them, the instructional steps in several primers and first readers of several basal reader series were examined. This was approached in two ways: (1) to translate the logical steps that are required of the child  by each lesson into descriptive, abstract notations; and (2) to develop an analogue of the set of grapheme-phoneme correspondences for many of the phonics lessons in the teachers' manuals. Results from using the analogues indicated that children have much more difficulty with rules that involve changes from a regular pattern, children were often able to do the analogue lessons more easily than the parallel phonics lessons, and the same basic concepts are taught using different places within the same manual.

The assessment plan looks at students in terms of two questions: How well is the student achieving in reading in comparison with other students in his class, his grade, and at his age across the city and/or nation? Can the student read the material that the school and society expect him to read? The first question was answered by looking at the standardized tests administered each year. An analysis of student achievement on these tests showed that Madison students do on the average read as well as or better than students from cities across the nation. The second question has not been  fully assessed, and it is this question that the assessment plan is attempting to answer. Students focused upon in this plan were fourth, seventh, tenth, and twelfth graders. Reading was defined as an ability to gain information from what was read. The cloze test was used as the measuring instrument; this procedure was selected because of its utility, validity, and objectivity. The final report of this project is due to appear shortly. (WR)",

        "description":"A search of experimental and theoretical literature and an analysis of professional textbooks, instructional materials, and published tests were carried out in order to (1) determine current concepts of reading comprehension deriving from experimental investigations, verbal statements, and models and (2) establish the extent to which these concepts were represented consistently in current secondary reading professional textbooks, instructional materials, and published tests. The study revealed a basic dichotomy between concepts of comprehension described in terms of overt behavior (particular skills) and those described in terms of covert behavior (cognitive operations): much of the difficulty in understanding the nature of comprehension appears to derive from a failure among  experimenters and theorists to associate overt behavior with underlying covert processes. It was concluded that until the covert psychological process which produces comprehension is explained, verbal descriptions of comprehension skills (and, by implication, instructional objectives) are almost certainly going to be imprecise. (Various experimental definitions of comprehension are delineated and a bibliography is appended.) (MF)",

The plurality of languages is a critical factor  in the development of literacy. In such countries as Morocco, Angola, India, and Malaysia it is not uncommon to find one language recognized for official uses, another used in public schools and yet another used in private and parochial schools.

The first study dealt with pooling independent sentences into groups of related sentences and preparing passages by stringing these sentences together. College students then read one of the passages three times, producing a written recall after each reading. The main result was that, with blocked presentation, clustering of sentences from related sentence groups rose over trials, but with mixed presentation it did not. The second study attempted to apply the sorting technique developed by Mandler. An analysis of all the data revealed no tendency for subjects to cluster items in recall with other items sorted into the  same piles. The third study was an attempt to manipulate the structure of information in a passage in a simple manner. An examination of the results showed that there was no significant difference between groups. The final study identified idea units and then sought to determine the hierarchical set of relationships which the passage established among these. The general conclusion from this study was that the structure obtained from the analysis of the passage seemed to be related to cognitive structure subjects established while reading the passage.

One predominant concern of all English teachers is the issue of priorities in education. English teachers are especially anxious to rearrange educational perspectives by finding alternatives to systems approaches. The entries in this document try to show teaching techniques, response modes, and evaluation procedures that are superior to impersonal systems and more accurate than any accountability procedure. However, many of these techniques could be programmed, or framed as behavioral objectives, although in both cases, the task would  be difficult. Polarized, the educational alternatives that we face are systems approach versus the human factor.

Listening is defined according to six approaches: comparative, ostensive, classificational, structural, operational, and synonymic. Some past and current ideas concerning a taxonomy of listening skills are discussed as to the dimensions of these skills, their prerequisites, ways of classifying them, and a method for formulating skills into learner objectives and arranging them into tentative hierarchies. Examinations are made of criticisms and rationales for listening tests in general, standardized tests, unpublished tests, publishers' informal assessments which accompany their instructional materials, and informal devices such as coding sheets,  standards, and checklists. Selected published and unpublished materials designed for various types of instruction, goals, and populations, starting with the young child, are reviewed, and studies and ideas on various teaching techniques are presented. Research references, annotated when appropriate, are given at the end of the report for all chapters. An appendix gives some sample listening lessons from the Thinking Improvement Project (TIP).

At the same time, he should capitalize on the students' dialect skills to teach them standard English skills. Teaching Activities which further these aims are: (1) teaching the distinctions among language, dialect, and idiolect (the personal use of Language); (2) exploring the uses of dialect in literature; (3) training students to develop their own linguistic atlas of their area, city, or state; (4) teaching the history of the English language; (5) conducting language mediation exercises to classify and study--without prescriptive judgments--the dialects of  members of the class; and (6) using personal language charts, work charts, narrative charts, and language skill charts. Through such activities as these, students from different ethnic groups and races can use dialect study to profitably learn about each other's heritages. (DI)",

        "description":"This paper discusses a pilot program for a writing course taught by four teachers at Drexel University. One of the primary assumptions was that a course in writing was also one in language. The object of the course was to ask the students to become conscious of themselves as learners and writers and to attempt to discover the function of language in learning. The first assignment asked the students to speculate about the meaning of a college education and about what learning is. Another assignment asked the students to describe, from memory, the face of a telephone dial. When the students compared the actual dial to their descriptions, they found that learning is fundamentally not what we experience, but what we tell ourselves we have experienced--that learning is language\"about\" experience. The paper discusses subsequent theme assignments leading up to a final theme that asked the students to assess what they had learned about learning, language, and writing. The author concludes that the course was valuable because it left the students with an informed responsibility for their own education and gave them a chance \"to belong to themselves.\" (DI)",

The search was limited to studies reported during the period November 1966 to November 1971. Applying the selection criteria of the total project, no studies were found that clearly specified teaching behavior during spelling instruction. Spelling studies continue generally to be concerned with (1) the nature of the orthography, (2) learner variables, or (3) instructional method. While a comprehensive understanding of what constitutes effective spelling instruction must take into account these factors, teacher interaction with  pupils during spelling instruction needs also to be accounted for. The effects of teaching behavior upon pupil achievement in spelling appears to be at least one factor warranting future study. (Author)",

The educational attainments of nine-year-olds, thirteen-year-olds, seventeen-year-olds, and adults (ages 26-35) were surveyed according to their ability to recognize literary works and characters. Five types of exercises were used: (1) an illustration of a well-known nursery rhyme, story, or poem; (2) parodies of famous poems; (3) allusions to some literary work or character; (4) a disguised myth or story pattern; and (5) straightforward questions about specific works and characters. Sample responses to the exercises and detailed results are included. The authors state that the ultimate goal of this study was to discover whether people could use their knowledge of literature to  confront new situations, either in literature or in life. The judgment about what the presence or lack of this literary knowledge means is left to the reader. (Statistical data, pages 125-98, removed because small type size prohibits reproducibility.)

Usage of each of the test structures was assessed on each of three speech elicitation tasks--spontaneous speech, structured open-ended responses, and sentence repetition. Phonological structures were assessed on a fourth task, single word picture naming. The findings revealed (1) the copula, single negative transpositions, and postvocalic consonant clusters were used in a similar way by both black and white low socioeconomic children that differed from the pattern of usage  evidenced by the middle socioeconomic white children; (2) nonstandard performance on the postvocalic /r/, postvocalic /1/, morphological \"s\" markers, and certain negative constructions was found to be unique to the low socioeconomic black children; and (3) test structure usage was generally consistent across the different modes of speech elicitation for the three groups, except for a higher incidence of grammatical-syntactic transpositions by the black group on more spontaneous elicitation modes. In addition, sentence repetition procedures were found to be a more powerful tool for displaying dialect forms. (HOD)",

Only empirical studies of teacher behavior are reported. Studies primarily concerned with listening, children's literature, thought processes associated with language arts teaching, reading, oral language, speaking, spelling, and writing, as well as guides, general directions, manuals, and linguistics in foreign language instruction, are excluded. The studies that are reported include several describing controlled teacher behavior and the effects of using various linguistically based classification schemes, the compared behavior of groups of teachers carrying out differing  curriculum tasks, and changes in behavior resulting from linguistic manipulation. Many of the studies center on the improvement of oral language or the teaching of oral language, nonstandard speech, and the language of bilingual children. The studies are few and marginal, suggesting that teacher preparation does not generally require linguistics training, that curriculum studies which cite what is being taught are usually not concerned with teacher behavior, and that further research is needed.

Works of art are intended to be a stimulus to the student's sense of unity between form and content, and the objectives are aimed at transferring the student's perception of form and unity into a process which can improve the quality of his writing. The method consists of a prewriting sample of student paragraphs, a slide of a work of art as visual stimulus to perception, performance objectives for structuring paragraphs, other visual devices such as models of paragraphs, sequentially arranged instruction based on approximations of the final results, in-class practice of every objective, and frequent encouraging reinforcement of student  responses. Objectives for the method require the student to include in his paragraph (1) the title of the art work; (2) the name of the artist; (3) the name of the work of art; (4) quotation marks around the title of the work; (5) dominant impressions the student had of the work; (6) logical order to details; (7) a minimum of three details; (8) each detail must be related to the dominant impression; (9) repetition of key ideas; (10) mention of the artist; and (11) a clincher sentence to finish off the paragraph.

One writing skill which transformational grammars can help students achieve is the ability to choose between synonymous expressions. Some transformations which have rhetorical significance are the passive voice, the \"there\" transformation, extraposition, and the cleft. Each of these transformations enables a writer to take different syntactic routes through a sentence. Another transformation which has rhetorical significance is clause consolidation, or the ability of a mature writer to embed a number of sentences into one. While this discussion of transformations does not prove  the extent to which transformational grammar can be related to the teaching of writing, it can be useful in the evaluation of writing. (DI)",

To test this hypothesis, two pilot studies were conducted at Brigham Young University in the summer of 1972, and a more extensive study was run in the spring of 1973. The object was to present the class instructor in a social power position in the experimental condition, and in a non-power position in the control condition. Students were made to infer that their responses would affect their standing with the instructor and thus their grade. The data compiled do not  support the authors' hypothesis that in a communications situation a message receiver will be less candid and more anxiety-ridden in feeding back information to a sender who exerts social power.

In the interactions between nations, it can be concluded that as international tensions are lessened, arms negotiations will become more task-oriented rather than affect-oriented; the more flexible the national goals, the more likely is the success of the negotiations; and the lower the key of bargaining threats, the more successful the talks. Superior to Bales' Interaction Process Analysis in this specific application is Bargaining Process  Analysis which provides, for example, thematic content analysis and means for coding interactions of bargaining participants in free verbal communication both in the laboratory and in actual international negotiations.

When conversation is effortless and witty, it elicits a fleeting pleasure--\"Narcissus.\"\"Phatic communion\" (small talk) is less superficial because it seeks pleasure not only in serving the self, but in letting others know you desire to identify with them. Unfortunately, this exchange usually becomes our most conspicuous escape from intimacy. The layer where pleasure is profound enough to last a lifetime is called \"self-discovery.\" This level constitutes the  truth that we cannot come to know ourselves except as we see ourselves in the eyes of another. Conversation at its deepest level of pleasure is called \"mutual discovery.\" This type of conversation transcends the parties involved and must be instantly recognized as being close to the core of life itself.

It focuses upon the parallel mechanisms within the overall system and suggests relationships between their activities and their consequent sound code product. The pump-valve model is particularly useful because it provides for a straightforward treatment of the speech code. Each of the articulators is given equal weight, and the functioning of one is not emphasized at the expense of others. The treatment of prosodic or suprasegmental features  such as pitch and loudness may be deferred until the segmental features are considered, or they may be omitted entirely. (EE)",

A counselor for children with such anxieties will be better able to assist them if he has some insight into how others and the counselor himself are perceived by the clients. The difficulty for the counselor is that those with low self-esteem will tend to disbelieve any positive reinforcement they are given.

        "description":"There is evidence of a growing trend toward ticket splitting, or independent voting patterns in all U.S. elections, especially in recent years. Independence of the electorate in 1972 was visible in the large Republican vote for President, during substantial voting for Democrats in Congress, and in gubernatorial elections. Analysis of mass media variables and the electorate in general leads to the conclusion that the DeVries and Tarrance testing model is unconfirmed. Researchers who posit a correspondence between perceptually derived data on mass media influence and ticket splitting have yet to support that position convincingly. (CH)",

With the recession of behaviorism and with the resurgence of cognitive psychology the discipline became known as Intercultural Communication. Rather than emphasizing the similarities between cultures, a principle previously advocated, the content of the field of intercultural communication focuses on the premise that people do differ in very fundamental ways because of their backgrounds and cultures. As a result of this trend, the study of values and reasoning as effective commodities of instruction in intercultural communication courses has emerged. Cultural differences in the dimensions of perceptions, patterns of thinking, language and values are of relevance to the student. (EE)",

Women should be more aggressive in pursuing their rights to fill administrative positions for which their education and experience fit them.

It is locally based so that it can assess and meet the needs of individual students, but it is also far enough away from the constraints faced by school districts to foresee the need for change and to implement that change. It should and can involve local personnel at all levels -- planning, implementation and evaluation -- for it is impossible to be an effective change agent without careful planning and development. This service unit can  also conduct workshops in the application of new planning technologies; support the development of computerized management information systems; assess educational needs at the regional and State levels; coordinate local and State planning efforts; and identify and utilize all funding sources applicable to educational planning.

The author feels, however, that at the present time there are too many attendant obstacles in making students full-fledged members of official school boards. These obstacles center on statutory regulations, high mobility rates for this age group, and adverse administrator reaction. The best plan of action would appear to be to retain, remodel, and revitalize the existing student councils, interrelating them with one of the newer approaches such as that of the student school board. Examples are drawn from developments in the secondary schools of the City of  Norfolk; emphasis is placed on the need for structuring student input. (Author)",

        "description":"In this speech, the author explains that metamethodology is a system designed to develop and test a methodology for a specific, definable purpose; and, as such, to provide for the development of, and the research into, methodologies. The paper begins with a brief clarification of the difference between methods and methodology and a discussion of the development and refinement of metamethodology. The main body of the document is concerned in detail with the seven basic steps of metamethodology: (1) State the purpose of the proposed methodology; (2) test the purpose by criteria such as its desirability, practicability, uniqueness, and operationability; (3) analyze the implications of the purpose; (4) operationalize the purpose; (5) design procedures; (6) test the procedures; and  (7) revise the purpose and/or procedures, if necessary. The author contends that the steps should accomplish three things necessary to produce the best possible methodology for a definable purpose: (1) The determination of the purpose, (2) the development of the steps that make up the methodology, and (3) the testing of the methodology to see that it accomplishes the purpose. The complete methodology of metamethodology is shown in an appendix. (Author/DN)",

Three speakers first address themselves to the problems inherent in educational governance operating within a complex political framework, in light of the fact that governance in itself is essentially a political activity. Two speakers then consider fiscal problems related to State education system governance. The discussions center on the kinds of governance constraints stemming from both local and governmental fiscal constraints. The next three addresses speak to a number of issues that reflect the way in which laws -- and the administrative structure ordained by the law -- control educational governance.  Although the political, fiscal, and legal settings together constitute the basic matrix in which governance of State education systems is embedded, a large number of other forces impinge on the actual governance operation. Some of the resultant operational problems are discussed in the five papers that conclude the presentation. (Author/DN)",

According to the report, two thirds of the people in this survey who say they support integration are also generally opposed to busing. The survey was designed to learn the extent to which public opposition to busing is monolithic and implacable and to study the relationship between accurate knowledge about the facts of existing busing requirements and attitudes on the issues. The survey produced three basic findings: (1) the public seriously misunderstands the facts of the busing controversy; (2) those who best understand the facts are more supportive of busing and much more opposed to Congressional action  or a Constitutional amendment to forbid court-ordered busing; (3) most people expressing an opinion are willing to support strictly limited busing when there is no other way to desegregate the schools.

The document begins with a description of current school district revenue sources and discusses the official division of responsibility for school finance between the State and local governments. The author then criticizes the present system, founded when the cities were relatively richer than they are today, on the grounds that it has led to inequity, illogical resource allocation, and poor long-range planning. Financial data for the school districts of Long Island, New York, are presented in a case study to point out that the present system of finance discriminates against low wealth and large districts while  favoring small and rich districts. The document then suggests how a program involving State assumption of educational costs would look and considers the various arguments against full State assumption. The document concludes by suggesting reasons for preferring State assumption of educational costs to district power equalizing. (Appended tables may reproduce poorly. ) (Author/DN)",

Data from all school districts of the State are analyzed for the school year 1971-72. Also, since by the legislature in October 1971 there was a major change in the Minnesota system of financing education, data for the school year 1971-72 are compared with that of the previous year to determine the impact of the new legislation.

Eight states -- California, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, and Oregon -- were chosen for study, to represent a range in (1) the level of State aid, (2) the average per pupil expenditure, (3) interdistrict disparities, (4) propensities to innovate, and (5) region. Recent school finance legislative history, the current educational finance system, significant factors affecting education finance reform outcomes, and the reform efforts during the 1972 legislative session were examined for each of the eight States. Study results show that the distribution of property wealth and income,  the perceptions of educational needs, and patterns of urbanization will be critical variables in developing alternative proposals for financing education. The study documents the political diversity among States affecting education finance outcomes; and it indicates that a single, national solution to school finance problems will fail to resolve the specific and different issues in individual States even though all States share certain issues in common.

        "description":"In 1971 the North Carolina General Assembly enacted a tenure law for the State's public school teachers and principals. Codified as G.S. 115-142, the Act became effective July 1, 1972. It requires local boards of education to adopt &quot;reasonable rules and regulations&quot; for the conduct of hearings on dismissing or demoting teachers and principals. This booklet contains five procedural codes to be usedas guides for boards of education as they develop their own hearing regulations. These codes concern teacher dismissal, demotion, or the nonrenewal of a teacher's contract. They also describe procedures to be followed in dismissing assistant superintendents and superintendents during the contract period, and provide forms to be used with these procedures by the superintendent or the  school board. The appendix contains the State Board of Education hearing regulations to be followed in the event the local school board does not adopt its own regulations and a chart showing the time requirements of the tenure act when a recommendation to dismiss or demote a teacher has been made.

        "description":"Accessibility to the content of a curriculum materials collection is primarily determined by the simplicity of the classification scheme used to organize the materials in the collection. The classification system utilized to organize such a collection should structure and arrange materials in such a fashion that the patrons can serve themselves with ease. In order to provide the patron with maximum independence and freedom when dealing with the materials in question, it is necessary to provide both open shelving, thereby allowing browsing, and a properly constructed card catalog that affords a more direct means of access to the materials in the collection. This paper presents a classification schedule which may be utilized to organize the printed materials found in a curriculum  laboratory. The schedule is designed to provide the user with maximum ease of access to the materials contained in the collection and relieves the curriculum librarian of many of the clerical routines common to the processing of new materials. The summary includes general recommendations for the application of the schedule and suggestions relating to the organization and administration of the entire collection of printed curriculum materials.

The purpose was to assist local education agencies to develop and implement their own programs for the disadvantaged and for all students. Documents related to educational programs for the disadvantaged were obtained, and a total of 1,740 were selected for classification and dissemination. Demonstration packets of these documents on microfiche were distributed to the 50 state departments of education and selected large and medium-sized city school systems. These documents on the disadvantaged are the first 1,740 ED references in the ERIC system. This volume is a  coordinate index for those 1,740 documents with ED citations grouped under the appropriate descriptor terms which are alphabetically arranged. (This coordinate capability is lost in microfiche format, and is best achieved in hardcopy by cutting the pages down the middle.) The companion number and author index is available as LI004036.

        "description":"A discussion on the rights of children both within the legal structure of society and in the family are discussed. The position is taken that children have the right to be responsible for their own actions, the right to internalize control over their own behavior. It is also contended that under the conditions of freedom, choice, and contingent feedback from the environment, children develop the capacity to set goals for themselves and to take appropriate actions in pursuit of these goals. This is the essence of voluntary responsible behavior. It is pointed out that the roots of responsibility run all the way back to the beginning of life. Three theories of behavior exist: (1) the psychodynamist, i.e., man is driven by instinct, inborn and immutable; (2) Behaviorism, which views  man as a passive processor of information; and (3) the view that man is an active, manipulating, conscious organism, who is, under the proper circumstances, capable of structuring the world, comprehending it, and of controlling his own actions and intentions. Responsibility is described as a pattern of behavior which starts early in life with the free exploration of the environment. It is finally pointed out that to insure the rights of children to develop and grow to the peak of their potential, it is necessary to understand and enhance the conditions which facilitate this growth.

The bases for curriculum decisions and the overall operating procedures remained essentially as they were the previous year. On the basis of the experience of the first year and in response to changed conditions a number of modifications were made in staffing pattern, curriculum, and daily operation. There were 50 children in the school. All but one lived in the area served by the Heman Street Elementary School.  Data has been collected supporting the following statements: (1) The children enrolled in the Preschool have shown a small but consistent gain in Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test scores between pretest (administered in the fall) and posttest (administered in the late spring); (2) Low-scoring children gain more than others, the effect being greater than that to be expected from regression effects; and (3) Greater gains were shown by children receiving instruction as described in the Peabody Language Development Kit than by those receiving instruction in the Distar Language I Program.

Major research conducted to date and a study currently underway are reviewed. In sum, this paper hopes to raise a number of important questions for future investigation. Much previous research has investigated the hypothesis that boys receive more teacher disapproval than girls. There have been three general approaches to studying this topic: (1) direct observations of teacher behavior, (2) subjective reports by teachers concerning their treatment of boys and girls, and (3) subjective reports by children concerning their perception of teacher attitude toward boys and girls. The majority of studies using direct measures of teacher behavior  confirms the hypothesis that boys receive more teacher disapproval than girls. Other studies have suggested that the interaction between various student characteristics, their sex, and teacher reaction is the important consideration. To investigate this, Sears (1963) asked a group of teachers to rate the children in their classes in terms of how much he/she enjoyed having each one in the group. A number of personality and ability measures on the children were available. The children were divided into two ability groups by sex for data analysis. The results indicated that the characteristics which best predicted whether a teacher would like a pupil differed for each of the four groups. Five general questions emerge. These include: (1) To what extent does stereotyping exist among teachers?  and (2) To what extent do teacher characteristics determine the nature of the stereotypical behavior? (CK)",

Existing statistical resources in Alabama and the 1970 federal census data were used in preparing this report. In addition, empirical data was gathered throughout Alabama to project the state-wide need for day-care. The Status and Needs Study is divided into two parts: (1) a descriptive profile of existing licensed day-care services, and (2) an analysis of the distribution of children in these day-care services. Where possible, the profile of day-care services is presented in terms of sponsorship and type of service. The unit of analysis is a county; however, these units can easily be collapsed into larger planning areas such as  Economic Development Districts. The 392 licensed day-care centers in the State of Alabama which were reviewed are presently serving 14,392 children. The next four sections deal only with the children served by the licensed centers. Subsequent sections incorporate data on children served by family day-care homes, in-home care, group day-care contracts, and Head Start Programs. In addition, one section reviews several important day-care projects that await approval in Washington. (Two pages of text are of marginal legibility.) (Author/CK)",

In Experiment 1, 40 female students from elementary psychology served as subjects. Two sets of nonoverlapping 11-word serial lists were composed from a set of 22 two-syllable nouns. The words were typed in upper case letters for presentation by memory drum. Each subject learned a nonoverlapping set of 2 lists by the anticipation technique with 4 sec. anticipation and intertrial intervals. In Experiment II, a total of 48 subjects, 24 male and 24 female, from undergraduate psychology  classes learned the lists. Subjects were equally distributed by sex over conditions. Two different lists composed of 10 two-syllable nouns were constructed. Each subject learned both lists, half in each order. The results of these two experiments indicate that numbering of serial lists does not improve performance in initial learning. Also, while the present data do not settle the issue of how learning numbered lists differs from the learning of unnumbered lists, they do indicate that there are differences between them. (CK)",

Lists were presented for 6 trials at 1.5 or 3.0 sec. per item with 20 Ss per list. Only correct responses were reinforced. The uncertainty (H) in the response distribution was calculated for each item on each trial and summed for each list. The H remaining after Trial 6 averaged over all 3-sec. conditions was 8.4 bits. For the 1.5-sec. conditions, it was 15.2 bits, indicating that  information was being processed at a constant rate. The amount of information processed per trial was also constant for each list condition, although differences among lists reached borderline significance (p .05) at the 3-sec. rate.

The first grade reading test was constructed in two forms, one using Distar reading font and the other traditional type font. A second grade subgroup of nineteen Distar pupils was compared to a group of twenty non-Distar pupils on reading readiness and achievement in first  grade, and IQ and achievement in reading, language, and arithmetic in second grade. A significant difference in arithmetic computation favored the Distar group. The total (n=51) second grade Distar group was found significantly below grade norms (2.9) on four of seven achievement subtests. Recommendations included supplementing the Distar program with instruction for greater transition to reading connected sentences and paragraphs, and instruction on specific comprehension skills.

This discussion deals primarily with the implications of the use by parents of physical pain as a child-rearing technique by which they attempt to implement their goals for their children, whether it be the acquisition of positive behaviors or the extinction of unacceptable or negative behaviors. An unfavorable view is taken of parental resort to physical punishment, based on a personal position and empirical psychological research. The personal reasons include: (1) the issue of the unfairness of an adult physically striking a child, (2) the issue of language, i.e. the reliance of humans on verbal means in the training of their young, and (3)  the issue of intentionality, the deliberate infliction of physical pain. On the scientific level, three principal sources of empirical literature are drawn upon to support the position of opposition of physical punishment. The first relates to studies on the consequences of punishment in the context of child-rearing practices; the second relevant data sources are the experimental studies of the effects of punishment; and the third pertinent set of investigations are those studies relating inhibitory traits to other personality attributes, particularly aggression.

The program attempts to acquaint the child with early learning performance rather than remediate failure later in the school setting. The K-3 program  serves 130 kindergarten, first, second, and third grade students. Two sites utilize a multi-media, small-group tutorial, diagnostic/prescriptive format to alleviate deficiencies in language and reading. The in-service component serves each population as an assist in keeping people informed about the project. The management component is primarily involved in determining the program, both offering direction for and causing implementation of the program, writing role descriptions and strengthening same as need arises. This report is an evaluation concerned with finding immediately-relevant answers for decision making. (CK)",

        "description":"In this evaluation study, two groups of children who attended kindergarten either one-half day every day or full-day on alternate days were compared. An opinion survey was conducted to obtain the observations of parents, kindergarten teachers, and elementary principals in relation to the all-day alternate day schedule in 55 school districts. Data were collected on 96 kindergarten children during the last two weeks of the 1971-72 school year. Of these children, 48 had been attending the full-day alternate-day kindergartens and 48 had been attending the half-day daily kindergartens. The children ranged in age from 5 years 9 months to 7 years 9 months for the full-day group and 5 years 9 months to 6 years 9 months for the half-day group. No fewer than 8 and not more than 10 children  were taken from each of 10 classrooms. Two examiners from the State Department of Education asked questions of a single child for about 25 minutes. A test of pre-academic skills was developed for this study, and the Caldwell Preschool Inventory was used. Results of the study showed that the two groups were similar on the measure of broad readiness experiences, and they were dissimilar on two of the pre-academic skill measures. Children who attended kindergarten daily had significantly higher scores on tests of ability to name numerals 1 to 10 and on knowledge of the sounds of letters of the alphabet. There were no significant differences on the Caldwell Preschool Inventory. On all measures, the children in the full-day alternate-Day programs had lower scores and greater group variability.  An appendix provides survey forms and test forms. (DB)",

Topics discussed relevant to the Human Services Policy are community services, health services, and education. Highways and road policy, housing policy, fiscal resources of the local government, and strengthening the local government are topics discussed under State Development Policy. The Natural Resources Policy discusses water resources, the soil survey and mapping program, shoreline erosion, and agriculture and land use. Population, income and employment, health education, libraries, and  highways are discussed as supporting data concerning rural-urban imbalance. Some recommendations generated as a result of the RASC's efforts include greater utilization of existing school facilities for nonschool educational and cultural functions for the benefit of communities, the provision of improved and reliable access to a reasonable and acceptable quality of health care for all Virginians, and the development of selected community services and facilities bearing on the ability of a community to grow and encouraging people to choose such a community as a place to live.

It was also found that the proportion of minority students who remain in school through the 12th grade is lower than that of Anglo students, that a disproportionately large number of Chicanos lack reading skills commensurate with age and grade level, that the reading achievement drop is severe for minority children as they advance in age and grade, that grade repetition rates for Mexican Americans are higher than for Anglos, that Mexican Americans are as much as 7 times as likely to be overage as Anglos, and that Chicanos are underrepresented in extracurricular activities.

Tentative conclusions were that the suggested Index of Developmental Potential was internally consistent and that the variables appeared to be indicative of the developmental potential of communities.

A 63-item questionnaire was administered to each pair of parents by a trained Spanish-speaking interviewer. The results indicated an homogeneous positive attitude toward bilingual education with few significant differences between socioeconomic groups. It was also found  that those under age 35 were more positive in their attitudes than were the older group, that amount of education did not seem to alter attitudes significantly, and that the amount of mobility significantly affected the response toward certain statements. The major conclusion of the study was that parents enthusiastically approved of the on-going bilingual and bicultural programs to which their children were being exposed.

Recently, bilingual education has begun to have a position in the formal education process of schools throughout the United States with students whose first language is not English. This bulletin, designed with the hope that it can assist school teachers or administrators in designing, implementing, and conducting bilingual education programs, discusses the bilingualism of Mexican-Americans. For a bilingual education program to work with Mexican-Americans, a person must understand, or at least know about, certain aspects of the Mexican-American culture. This bulletin discusses the history of Mexican-Americans in southern Texas since 1836, the social structure of their  communities and home life, their religion, the differences between their basic value configurations and those of Anglo-Americans, and how their culture affects their education. The role of linguistics and a person's first language in a bilingual program, methods and techniques for second-language teaching, and bilingual teaching in content areas are also discussed. General suggestions for language teaching, techniques for teaching reading and writing, reinforcement activities, and art activities are given. Sample lessons, in both English and Spanish, are included for 1st grade science, 2nd and 4th grade mathematics, 5th and 6th grade art, and 3rd and 6th grade social studies. (NQ)",

A basic responsibility in this effort is to survey conditions and determine problem areas related to migrant workers and take an active part in the development of assistance programs. The Commission's efforts in correlating and evaluating operational programs for migrants and their families is the basis for this annual report. An overview of Texas migrant labor describes the emergence and finally the domination of the seasonal  agricultural labor force by Spanish-speaking people. Topics discussed include Texas agriculture and migrant labor, the Texas Inter-Agency Task Force on Migrant Labor, the role of the Church in migrant matters, bilingual education in Texas, alien labor and immigration, and a description of the Farmers Home Administration. Current developments in education, housing, health, job development and employment, and resumes of specific Federal programs are also presented.

If so, what kinds of schools should and can they be? Should some of them have special purposes? What types of students should be enrolled?

The evaluation team made 9  recommendations, including that students' records should include the quantum of blood, manner of recruitment, and current progress; that applicants should be advised of the specific reason for rejection; that applicants should be advised at the earliest possible date that Summer Orientation is optional for well-qualified applicants; that detailed fiscal records should be maintained for each student; and that each graduate's file should reflect the date of admission to the bar and the jurisdiction.

The approach to the evaluation of the Center was based on the working definition used by the Division of Evaluation and Program Review of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Education Programs, which includes (1) determining the decision areas of concern, (2) selecting, collecting, and analyzing information needed in making those decisions, and (3) reporting that information to the appropriate decision-makers so that they may decide among alternative courses of action. The information categories examined were background, legalities and Indian involvement,  objectives, budget and finance, and Center components. Conclusions and recommendations included the following: (1) the Center's activities to date are worthwhile and defensible under JOM funding, and JOM funding should be continued in FY 1974; (2) since possibly the combining of migrants and Indians is not helpful, but instead results in difficulties with both groups, efforts should be made to clarify the population to be served; (3) the role of the Center and the problems it is attempting to resolve should be better defined; and (4) the role of and services offered by Central Washington State College should be clarified.

BIA educational information needs are identified in the following areas: assessment of needs, establishment of goals and objectives, planning for implementation, operation, evaluation, evaluation recycling, and pupil accounting. The proposed technical approach to the development of an education information program includes the utilization of a financial accounting sub-system and a pupil accounting sub-system. Steps suggested for the implementation  of these programs are that (1) recoding for the financial management sub-system should be completed early in Fiscal Year 1973, (2) elements of data should be collected in the fall of 1972 and made a part of the permanent pupil record system shortly thereafter, (3) plans should be developed for collecting pupil enrollment and attendance information, (4) plans should be made to administer an appropriate standardized achievement test to all pupils in attendance at Indian schools, (5) work should be done to develop uniform terminology for pupils and curriculum, and (6) work should be begun on standardized evaluation methods.

It seeks to survey the development of this method by tracing the development of the simulation gaming technique in symbolic simulation. Some of its utilities and liabilities are then identified. Simulation game topology is discussed, after which the educational and research potential of this gaming method is examined together with simulation game artifacts, cautions, and remedies for educational and research applications. Applications of the technique to health planning and consumer health education objectives generally are suggested, and a health maintenance game structure is outlined. The  game model focuses on problem areas most specifically relevant for those in the comprehensive health planning sphere, rather than limited to health planning education applications per se.

In many social  aspects, Sweden is unique. It has, for example, the highest life expectancy and lowest infant mortality in the world. Per capita gross national product is third largest in the world and has been growing at almost 5 percent a year. Unemployment has been low. An analysis of generation replacement for Swedish females born in 1870 and afterward reveals that, in cohort terms, Swedish fertility has been at or just slightly below replacement roughly from the 1895 cohort onward. Today, the main deficiency in the Swedish family planning program is shortage of personnel and facilities. (LK)",

The symposium was convened under the sponsorship of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (USAEC). The information is presented in a condensed and readily understandable form, and it is hoped that it will be useful to those interested in a summary view of the public health and environmental aspects of nuclear power production. Contents are organized according to major headings as follows: \"The Role of Atomic Energy in Meeting Future Power Needs,\"\"Radiation Protection Standards,\"\"Safe Handling of Radioactive Materials,\"\"Other Impacts,\"\"Public Health Considerations,\" and \"Summary.\"  Included in the summary are lists of \"pertinent publications\" of the IAEA, the World Health Organization (WHO), other international bodies, and a list of consultants and contributors. In addition to the symposium summary, this booklet also contains contributions supplied by 28 experts from IAEA and WHO and a number of member states. (LK)",

Proposed qualifications and training of these three classes of personnel are detailed, indicating the standard of knowledge required and the extent of the field to be covered. In  addition, a syllabus is developed for teaching agricultural meteorology at secondary schools (advanced education below university degree level) of agriculture, horticulture, and forestry.

This situation has been brought about by the shortage or lack of national cadres of hydrologists in developing countries to undertake comprehensive water management investigations and measures. Hydrometeorologists are classified in three categories: (1) specialists with at least a university degree in engineering or appropriate science, (2) specialists trained to a semi-professional technician level, and (3) specially trained observers, hydrometric assistants. Qualifications required at each level are enumerated, together with recommended curricula and programs for training each of the  three classes of personnel. In addition, a number of proposals are suggested regarding the organization of training hydrometeorological experts of various levels for developing countries. The need for concerted action of all international organizations in the training of hydrometeorological staff is also briefly described.

Topics and sub-topics include: location and description of the country; population--size, number of households, women of reproductive age, growth patterns, role of women, urban/rural distribution, ethnic and religious composition, literacy, economic status, and contraceptive knowledge; population growth and development--national economics and social welfare expenditures; history of population concerns; population policies; population programs--objectives, organization, operations, governmental role, education and communication efforts, and private agencies in family planning; and foreign assistance for family planning activities.  Summary statements indicate that program policy is to offer contraceptive information and services through the growing national network of family planning clinics, relying almost exclusively on pills as the contraceptive technique. The strength and sense of urgency of the national commitment can be seen both in the rapidly increasing channeling of talent and financial resources to this effort and in the ambition of national goals for decreasing the current high population growth rate.

Values-clarification techniques are enumerated, based on the belief that valuing involves processes of choosing, prizing, and acting. To help students clarify their values about the environment, while they are learning the valuing processes, several teaching strategies are suggested. These involve: (1) composing value sheets for student reaction, (2) writing captions for pictures depicting environmental problems, (3) role-playing, (4) creating contrived incidents to stimulate discussion on controversial environmental issues, (5) employing a devil's advocate approach as developing plausible reasons defending various pollution practices and  then justifying the position, (6) constructing value continuums, (7) responding to open-ended questions, (8) keeping a time diary for a week, (9) designing an autobiographical questionnaire, (10) voting on current issues, (11) rank-ordering environmental words, statements, and/or problems, and (12) coding phrases, statements, or essays indicating the writer's stand for or against an environmental situation. Teaching environmental education with a focus on values is believed to be not only a stimulating but a necessary approach for today's generation. (BL)",

Based on an interdisciplinary approach, the studies enable students to examine the ecological interrelatedness of the environment and the place of man, the impact of human society on the environment, and the possibilities of management and control. Presented in this report is a review of the emergence and present state of environmental studies in Britain followed by an assessment of the theme or content of environmental studies/sciences. The  approach to such studies is discussed from various points of view: sociological, biological, urban--rural, and world conservation problems. Subject information and teaching notes for the syllabus are developed in four sections: (1) processes and systems of the natural environment and the limits of the resource base, (2) the ecosystem, (3) the interaction of man and the environment, and (4) environmental conflicts and planning: a field study.

Its purpose is to convince the students that the use of safety belts to prevent injury or death is firmly supported by the considerations of physical quantities and laws which apply in a collision situation and hence that wearing belts while driving makes good sense. The material is divided into eight sections according to major physical concepts: velocity, acceleration, momentum, force, impulse, torque, energy, and stress and strain. Each section contains three to four classroom demonstrations, examples and problems, a laboratory experiment, and some programmed instructional materials. Examples and problems are meant to be  convincing mathematical verifications that safety belts should be worn every time one drives. Answers to the problems and guiding comments are included. Laboratory exercises are intended to give the student an intuitive feeling for the relevant physical principles and their application to collision situations. Purpose, equipment, procedure, questions, and comments related to the experiment are enumerated. Finally, the programmed learning material contains concept definitions and problems (with answers) for purposes of review. (BL)",

Hopefully, results of the conference will be manifested in improved conception and analysis of public works projects. The 16 major presentations dealt with several areas of concern: impact of the National Environmental Policy Act; how the Act has been implemented and some of the problems arising from it in the past two years; environmental impact perspectives exemplified by a systems approach to governmental decision-making and the total institution-wide emphasis on man  and his environment by the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay; impact assessment dimensions as conceptualization, communication, social aspects, and the application of mathematics; and procedures and programs for environmental impact assessment. Text of the Act appears in the appendix together with various aspects of impact statements--preparation process, sources for, summary of those already filed, and Federal agency contacts. (BL)",

Focused upon is total particulate matter of the kind normally measured by high-volume and paper-tape sampling methods and by dustfall collection. Further, it considers the effects of particulate matter in conjunction with some gaseous materials where important synergistic effects are observed. Methods of measuring the effects of particulate matter on meteorological conditions, atmospheric visibility, materials, and vegetation are  documented, as well as the resulting economic loss. Public awareness of air pollution and the role of particulate matter in the odor problem are assessed. There is a chapter on the respiratory system, discussing particulate deposition therein and removal therefrom, necessary to understanding the final chapters which survey toxicological effects of particulate matter and the epidemiological data for man and animals. A glossary of terms, lists of symbols, abbreviations, and conversion factors for various units of measurement, author index, and subject index are provided. (BL)",

The study was concerned with the aims and objectives, program content, teaching methods, evaluation and assessment, and future trends in the development of curricula for the gifted at the upper academic secondary level.  Questionnaires were designed on these aspects of biology teaching and completed by each member country. The report, with a number of tables and appendices, is divided into five separate chapters. General conclusions and recommendations are included in a separate section. In almost all countries, the status of biology is inferior to that of either physics or chemistry. With the recent changes in syllabi in these countries for more emphasis on genetics, cytology, ecology, developing skills and modes of thought for scientific study, the position of biology is improving gradually.

        "description":"First-grade students' understanding of several basic measurement processes was examined. Twenty randomly selected students from five first-grade classes in two different schools were individually examined on 11 measurement tasks. Seven of the tasks were adapted from items reported in the Gal'perin and Georgiev study, designed to test understanding of the unit of measure; four additional tasks required students to respond strictly on the basis of numerical clues. Students had difficulty with the tasks, which seemed to be the result of inability to conserve, inexperience with the specific measurement operations, and an ambiguity in several of the items. Findings showed that students did not have a stable concept of measurement and were not able to appreciate the value of a constant  unit of measure, that there was little transfer between tasks, that tasks involving unequal quantities were easier than similar tasks involving equal quantities, and that numerical cues were almost as strong as physical cues in certain conservation tasks.

In the integrated sequence (I) the mechanics of \"carrying\" and \"borrowing\" were treated as a single process \"regrouping.\" In the sequential treatment (S) the addition algorithm was developed before the subtraction algorithm. Students of two second-grade classes were randomly reassigned to either group S or group I. Profiles were generated by item sampling. Group means were estimated for addition, subtraction and total performance every three days. Also, on the eighteenth day all children were administered a 20-item achievement test. Overall differences in group performance were not significant. Some differences in performance on operations at  specific times were significant and favored group S.

The second volume provides detailed background information on the development of the advisory system, the variety of its functions, and the several kinds of committees that have evolved to serve those functions. It also examines major aspects of the operation of the science advisory committee system, describing certain  characteristics of committee membership, the selection, recruitment, and motivation of individual committee members, and the current strengths and weaknesses of committee operation. Although the report emphasizes the importance of recruiting younger scientists to serve on committees, it also discusses geographical and institutional representation, the recruitment of women and members of ethnic minorities, and the range of employment background represented.

Four problem sets were used in grades four through six, and four different sets were given in grades seven through nine; a total of 340 students participated. The data indicated that the relative difficulty of the exercises was nearly the same over grade levels. Results showed that the general equation used in previous studies did not yield accurate predictions for the problems, based on a chi-square test. New equations computed for each grade level gave more accurate, though not significant,  predictions. (Appendix B, pages 54-65, may be illegible.) (Author/DT)",

Rather than a survey course, it is suggested that several elective courses be offered. Main objectives of training programs for secondary school teachers of psychology are to not only prepare teachers academically for subject mastery but, moreover, to be able to help students apply and personalize the principles of psychology; to train teachers in pedagogical skills; to educate teachers in the knowledge of adolescent growth and behavior so they will be  sensitive to personal concerns of students; and to develop and evaluate psychology curriculum.

The creation of such a social studies design from 1968 to 1971 is described in this report. Chapter one focuses on the problem of the social studies program in the inner city, while chapter two gives a brief history of the project. Chapters three, four, and five discuss the products of the project, the evaluations of the  products, and the future of FICSS respectively. Twelve appendices comprise the remainder of this work.

The purpose of the theory construction presented in this paper, is to make the concept of formal education a more meaningful variable in studies of the political, economic, and social uses of schooling for national development. The purpose of  projecting hypotheses is not only to demonstrate the fruitfulness of the theories presented but also to stimulate the composition of alternative hypotheses and systematic efforts to verify or falsify all such hypotheses.

These objectives were tied to a larger goal, that of more effectively meeting the cognitive and affective needs of students in social studies classes. However, the findings of the first two years persuaded the staff to alter the objectives of the project to develop a &quot;change package&quot; of materials that would do something to teachers to cause them to become intrinsically motivated to improve their own  programs. The change package consisted of six basic documents produced by the staff, and a wide range of handouts. In addition, there were various in-service materials to help teachers move through the various stages of curriculum reform. The primary findings of the experimental implementation of the change package were that: 1) teachers can be motivated to change their programs, and 2) the package developed is useful but its contribution is small compared to what is needed.

Materials, prepared from trainers' experiences in other non-violent training including direct action and knowledge of philosophy of non violence, emphasize role playing and group dynamics. Five chapters include information on: 1) planning and conducting guidelines for trainers in nonviolent direct action; 2) directing and evaluating role plays; 3) and 4) understanding and teaching function roles of group members and strategy and tactics; and, 5)  leading and participating in direct action involving street speaking and leafleting. The material in the manual is suggestive rather than prescriptive. Trainers are encouraged to adapt methods and materials to needs of the particular group. (SJM)",

Emphasis is upon helping students to understand nonviolent action; to be familiar with training information on courses, time requirements, problems, costs, and procedures; and to deal with direct objectives toward peaceful social action. To stimulate thinking, the major portion of the handbook is in the form of questions of interest to students and teachers, and responses which were written by people previously involved in direct non-violent action. Resources and a bibliography for those interested in training for non-violent action are included. An appendix contains a model for fifteen hour weekend course, a list to check before acting, ideas for integrating social  change into the curriculum, a copy of an official Selective Service memorandum, a bibliography of films, and ideas on street theater.

They are examples of radical alternatives designed to serve a population not served by conventional schools and to convey instruction quite different from what is usually given in schools. In brief, the programs are more production-oriented than the so-called work-oriented literacy programs and are aimed at reaching thousands of people. Four vital principles are embodied in this approach to education: 1) use of low-level manpower with concomitantly simplified and scheduled calendars of instruction; 2) emphasis upon specific skills and knowledge applicable to the lives of the learners; 3) a concern to build confidence through success and have learners apply their new skills  and assume additional responsibility; and 4) to treat education as one of a complex of inputs designed to improve specific conditions.

A comparison of New York state social studies curriculum with other state guidelines illustrates that the conceptualization of American history has undergone a transformation, and  that attitudes toward a core have undergone a change. On the national level, fields other than American history are comprising a larger proportion of secondary social studies curriculum. The second question suggests the possibility of a modest study to furnish the necessary answers. It is the author's impression that other fields have had a major impact upon the study of American history through the curriculum materials developed. (Author/SJM)",

In the latter 1950's a Committee of Examiners composed of European history professors and secondary teachers formulated a course description comprised of a brief outline of an introductory survey in European history. It was organized chronologically with major emphasis on the period from the Renaissance to the Second World War. The structure of this course remained fundamentally unchanged for approximately fifteen years. In 1971 the Committee of Examiners re-evaluated the goals and methods of the program, and agreed to alter the content and structure of the course to reflect the educational changes of the 1960's. Several basic changes are: 1) the emphasis of the course  has shifted to the more recent modern period -- from the 1650's to the present; 2) stress is placed on cross-cultural comparisons of European history to other cultures; 3) structure focuses on broad thematic lines rather than on the chronological. Most significantly, the course will be constantly evolving as new themes are added. (SJM)",

Participants examined the concepts of conflict, power and authority, identity, and interdependence through content and team working sessions, ranging from games to lectures, and independent study in an effort to produce workable mini-units around the concepts. Rather than writing an original curriculum unit, emphasis was on coordinating available materials with the individual needs of the schools where the fourteen units would be taught by the participants. Contact will be made with teachers in a follow-up program by the DVEP staff who will visit classrooms to evaluate the effectiveness of the materials, to provide ongoing resource assistance,  and to choose the best units for wider local distribution. Staff and participants evaluated the workshop favorably. Teachers plan to implement mini-units and other workshop materials in their classrooms. Staff members met their minimum goals of producing mini-units and having teachers volunteer to test-teach materials in their classrooms. (SJM)",

Education in areas such as human rights could bring progress in international understanding. T. Miller, in the second paper, examined the implications for education of the development of international education. He argued first, that individuals need to be helped through education to develop to their full potential before they can handle concepts of international understanding adequately; secondly, that curriculum units need to be developed  which deal satisfactorily with international understanding concepts. The third paper, with an economic bias, presented by Derek Healey, analyzed the community's responsibilities in the development of international understanding. Discussion sessions centered on the implications of teaching for international understanding in both the primary and secondary schools in the areas of curricula, teaching emphases, teaching-learning methods and environments.

        "description":"This paper is concerned with conceptualizing from the human potential perspective the quality of life, poverty, the \"good social system\", service delivery, and social indicators. Theories of Maslow and other humanistic educators which stress the need for self actualization provide a framework to sociologists for improving human conditions by allowing individuals to maximize their potential through a restructured social system. To insure the quality of life, both physiological and psychological needs muat be met. Further, the extent to which social members develop their potential will depend on social structural variables. \"Goodness\" of social systems can be conceptualized in terms of the psychological health of system members, and of the extent to which human potential is  realized. Social indicators such as service availability and quality, income levels, and community differentiation are measures of aggregate and structural system characteristics which are indicative of the extent to which system members are able to develop their potential. In conclusion, the paper offers a starting point for a new approach towards a goal directed sociological inquiry. (SJM)",

The handbook suggests many specific activities to implement such a plan. Moreover, it attempts to demonstrate that these plans are practical by relating the specific projects participated in by the Des Moines East High School students in a span stretching more than two decades. Finally, a section is devoted to listing names of people who have worked with youth through the school in political work.

The paper then proceeds to offer a rationale for a social studies program organized in a manner that would place considerable emphasis on the nature of value systems and value judgments, and encourage teachers to be concerned with ways and means of teaching students: a) how to analyze and compare cultural value systems and, b) how to analyze and test value judgments. The rationale is followed by two models: one a curricular model designed to assist the teacher in developing a value-oriented social studies curriculum; and the other  a heuristic model consisting of a set of instructional strategies for dealing with value judgments in a logical and productive manner. Both models are consistent with logical principles associated with evaluation and grounded upon empirical findings about the nature of the evaluative process. The paper concludes with three appendices illustrating: 1) curricular model; 2) heuristic model, and 3) sample evaluations. (FDI)",

Parts of the Sequential Analysis of Verbal Interaction (SAVI) were used by raters who took a frequency count of statements from 2 hours of classroom session. The Personal Orientation Inventory (POI) was administered at the conclusion of the groups.

Teachers were asked to respond in writing to a written structured questionnaire. Following the return of the questionnaire, additional questions which would clarify responses were posed to the teachers in individual interviews. At the close of the interview each teacher was given a culture shock scale to help verify information resulting from the interview. Results  indicated that the teachers did experience culture shock, 26 of the selected transfers experienced moderate to extreme shock.

        "description":"In this study, two hypotheses were tested: (1) Self-report data are unrelated to behavior change; (2) Exposure to competent models of open and helpful behavior increases this skill performance in an encounter group. Two encounter groups were conducted with 18 college students who had the incentive to become more open, honest, and helpful. One group was presented with 1-hour of microlab activities; the other, 1-hour of video tape with instructions and modeling of open and helpful behavior. The Personal Orientation Inventory (POI) was administered before, following, and 3 weeks after each group. Behavioral rating forms for openness and helping were used 50 minutes of each hour by trained raters. The POI data indicated that all participants reported significant change in the  positive direction. No significant differences between groups were evident. Although self report data reflected no level effects, behavioral data reflected significant overall level effects on both combined openness and combined helping. The results of the study supported the hypotheses. Six references and 5 tables are included. (Author)",

The experimental group participated in simulated training over an 11-week period with feedback from the instructor as a part of their regular teacher training program. The control group followed the regular teacher training program without the use of simulation. The evaluative data were derived from the pre- and posttreatment use of seven instruments. The data were appropriately analyzed according to the specific nature of the data yielded by these instruments. As a result of the statistical analysis of the data, no significant differences were found.

The summary indicates inconclusive findings; however, five factors affecting optimum class size were stressed.

The data were gathered on Junior High and High School students in the Louisville Public Schools (Kentucky). Item easinesses and person abilities were estimated and compared by age group, within each age group, and across two points in time for the older age group. In addition, certain results from the Rasch analyses were compared with those of factor analysis. A sample of 1,000 students was taken from each of the groups (Junior High, 7th graders; Senior High, 11th and 12th graders). Results of the study are related to five questions considered. The first question was whether or not there were patterns of fit to the Rasch model when responses  are dichotomized in different ways. The results indicated that no single key was superior to others in producing fit. The second question was concerned with fit of the model for the data considered; it was found that frequently there was lack of fit, but it is noted that the test statistic was conservative. The third question related to the stability of item easinesses estimates within a group and across two points in time for that group. The conclusion was that different item easinesses are obtained when different degrees of possession of the trait are focused upon. The fourth question was how stable the tests of fits results are across time; pre- and post-comparisons of fit found 55% in agreement. The fifth question concerned how the item mean squares are related to factor loadings; in  almost all cases, the item with the highest mean square was also the item with the lowest loading.

        "description":"The objective of this study was to review and integrate the various methodologies used in the study of individual growth (especially academic growth). This was accomplished by means of Joreskog's general model for the analysis of covariance structures, i.e., each of the disparate methodologies available from the literature was shown to be a special case of Joreskog's general model. Two general considerations enter into the study of growth and its determinants: (a) making provision for errors of measurement, and (b) constructing a model which relates growth to its determinants in a causally meaningful way. Errors of measurement typically involve questions about the reliability and/or validity of measures, i.e., only indirect measures of the desired variable (construct) are  available. Multiple measures of each construct would appear necessary to deal with measurement errors in a quantitative manner. For this purpose the multitrait/multimethod approach devised by Campbell and Fiske (1959) is a useful approach since in principle it allows for correlated errors of measurement. Because the Campbell-Fiske approach does not specify the exact relationships between observed variables and constructs, a factor analytic formulation of their approach was used in order to summarize various approaches to measurement error. The constructs, which represent the growth variable and its determinants, were then interrelated in terms of a linear structural (causal) model. The implications of this model, which itself is a special case of Joreskog's general model, were considered.  (Author)",

        "description":"The development of school integration programs throughout the country has made possible a test of the hypothesis that school integration enhances black achievement, aspirations, self-esteem, race relations, and opportunities for higher education. The programs reviewed here have two important characteristics that may limit ability to their being generalized: they are examples of induced integration, and all use varying amounts of busing to accomplish integration. Five reports on integration programs in Northern cities throughout the country are cited: (1) Project METCO, Boston, Massachusetts; (2) White Plains, New York; (3) Ann Arbor, Michigan; (4) Riverside, California; and, (5) Project Concern, Hartford and New Haven, Connecticut. To test the hypothesis, findings are grouped  under five major headings--the effects of busing and integration on: (1) academic achievement; (2) aspirations; (3) self-concept; (4) race relations; and (5) educational opportunities. Program support is also examined. In each case, bused students are compared with the control groups to assess those changes that might be uniquely associated with the effects of induced integration. The implications of these findings for policy are then examined. Since the data do not support the hypothesis on most counts, the burden must fall upon those who support a given school integration program to demonstrate that it has the intended effects--with no unintended, negative side-effects.

Some of the problems that affect student attendance have been found to be gangs, money, race, and relevance of education. The project was formed so as to ameliorate these problems. Career development and community awareness were to be integral parts of the curricula that were to be developed. Self-contained classrooms and home contacts were specified as means of personalizing education. Work-stipend positions, which involved 15 hours of work each week, were available and paid from the project budget. Remedial math, remedial reading, health care, and food services were also  provided. The instructional and career development goals met with little success. The dropout rate was 21.3 percent while the average daily attendance was 78.1 percent. Other tenth graders in the high school had corresponding rates of 33.1 and 61.8 percent. Pretest-posttest gains were seven months in reading and two months in arithmetic. (Author/JM)",

The current food stamp program provides the poor with spending power enough to purchase at the level of the Department of Agriculture's Economy Food Plan. The dollar equivalent of this plan is 112 dollars a month for a family of four. This amounts to an average per person Federal subsidy or bonus of $13.45 per month, or 14.7 cents per meal. From January 1970 (when the food plan was $106), to July 1972 (when the food plan went to $112), the consumer price index for food consumed at home went up at a rate of 300 percent greater than the rise in the allotment. The Department of Agriculture, however, in 1968 had described the Economy Food Plan &quot;as not a reasonable measure of basic money needs for a good  diet.&quot; The diet of the three million people who are enrolled in the commodity distribution program would not be entirely adequate even if all received their full allotment of slightly over 37 pounds of canned and boxed goods each month. They would obtain at least 100 percent of the Recommended Daily Allowance of protein and six minerals and vitamins, but only 80 percent of needed calories. In fact, the program, however, distributes an average of 28.2 pounds of food each month, or 74 percent of the promised items by weight. (Author/JM)",

At that time, the contention that disadvantaged college students need affective recognition as well as cognitive recognition if they are to succeed in college was tested. The student body was made up of 36 compensatory education teachers culled from different parts of the country. The basic objective in the training program was to share professional experiences in compensatory teaching, and in so doing, extricate and collate the most useful and the most innovative strategies, with respect to both rationale and methodology, for teaching academically disadvantaged college  students. The program was divided into four major areas of probing: the communications skill area--English and mathematics; the generic subject matter area--the natural sciences and social studies; and the developmental counseling area and the intra- and interpersonal relations area. As the participants met from day to day in discussion, the strategies discussed in the paper were agreed to represent, among others, the most significant, innovative, and useful approaches in teaching academically disadvantaged college students.

Specifically, the program was designed to: (1) reduce intergroup prejudice by modifying in a positive direction attitudes toward self and others, and (2) help new students adapt to their new school. The program was implemented through the combined efforts of teachers and counselors. Three major components served as vehicles to achieve the goal. Discussion groups focused on: (1) clarifying myths underlying prejudice by examining the characteristics, values, and contributions of the minority groups; (2) the processes of value system development; and, (3) the consequences to  minority and majority groups of failing to resolve intergroup conflict. Communications groups provided planned opportunities to grow in self awareness and in the understanding, attitudes, and skills needed to relate positively to persons from different ethnic, social, and cultural backgrounds. The developmental, individualized reading program emphasized individual successes in reading as well as successes as a learner. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This study is an attempt to link sociological theory and research to student grouping procedures, to administrative decision making, and to student attitudes. It is also a modest demonstration of how school administrators might more rationally assess the operation of schools as goal-directed organizations. American schools are based on an age-graded social promotion model with performance levels and curriculum groups differentiated at the secondary level. Standardized psychometric tests of achievement and ability have purportedly been used to screen students rationally for grouping assignments, and thus to promote social mobility through academic achievement. Two metropolitan area suburban high schools, one predominantly black with ability grouping, and the other with a majority  of whites and heterogeneous groups within curriculum categories, were studied to determine the relative impact of different grouping procedures on their student clients. School personnel were interviewed, student records were examined longitudinally, and senior class members of each school completed self-administered questionnaires. As expected, grouping assignments within both schools were found to be highly related to social input characteristics of students and to their test scores, and vertical mobility between curriculum groups was minimal.

The long-term plan was for these children to be kept in a continuous sequential program through the first grade. Since another aspect of this project is a systematic attempt to learn how differing lengths of exposure to the L.L.P. influence the children's learning, the overall design calls for one group of children to be in the program for three consecutive years and another group for two consecutive years. The purpose of the evaluation study is: (1) to compare and contrast the development of the children who receive a two-year preschool program with those who receive a one-year pre-school program; and, (2) to compare and contrast the development of the  experimental groups with that of the control groups who were matched with them in intelligence, language, ability, perceptual-motor ability, and socioeconomic status. The results indicate that the children who participated in the program made significantly greater intellectual gains over the two- and three-year period than those children who attended and participated in traditional education programs.

A body of data on the test of performance of three disadvantaged minority groups--northern, urban black; southern, rural black; and, southwestern, Mexican-Americans--as tryout samples in contrast to white, advantaged groups in the same regions, was analyzed using five different general methods for examining tests for bias. In an item tryout, a set of items is administered to a sample of the relevant population and the results are then examined item by item in an effort to pick the more effective items. The first method is an item selection routine using the point biserial correlation for each item as the criterion. The second method,  group by score interactions, involves dividing the tryout group into, say, fourths, based on quartiles, and examining the proportion of the cases making each possible response in each of these levels. The third method involves plotting item difficulties so as to locate aberrant items. The fourth method involves estimating and plotting item characteristic curves separately for each group and comparing the plots. The fifth method comprises various intergroup factor analytic approaches. (Author/JM)",

Between 1963 and 1971, the Federal Government obligated 6.8 billion dollars for training 6.1 million people. This study examines five of these programs: Manpower Development and Training Act (MDTA), Neighborhood Youth Corps (NYC), Job Corps, Job Opportunities in the Business Section (JOBS), and the Work Incentive Program (WIN). MDTA and NYC are the largest of the manpower training programs, and have been in operation the longest. MDTA offers a wide range of institutional and on-the-job  instruction; it serves disadvantaged persons, although not exclusively. WIN treats only welfare recipients. NYC, JOBS, and Job Corps deal exclusively with disadvantaged persons, though each has its own structure and training methodology. JOBS is a private venture which is federally funded. The majority of Job Corps centers train youths at sites away from their home environment. NYC provides work experience, earnings, and training to high school students and dropouts, and encourages them to continue their education. (Author/JM)",

The Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS) was given at four points in time during this period to a total of 27,465 students. Composite mean ITBS scores were calculated separately for blacks and whites for each poverty group for each point in time. Multiple regression equations were then calculated for each point in time to show the relative weightings of the race and poverty variables as predictors of ITBS scores. The results for each point in time are very similar, the white &quot;least poor&quot; group in any grade being about one school year ahead of the&quot;extremely poor&quot; black group as regards educational achievement. However, when black and white children within a poverty level are compared, differences are much smaller and are negligible or nonexistent for the &quot;poor&quot; group. The poverty variable is four to six times more predictive than the race variable. The close association between achievement and economic level strongly suggests financial education assistance be expanded to include the economic improvement of the families and neighborhoods in which underachieving children live.

There are a variety of ways in which an ethnic student can find himself in a classroom situation where behaviors which had evoked positive reinforcement in his subculture are now negatively reinforced. Faced with discrepant reward systems, this student must choose between maintaining his ethnic pattern of response or adopting behaviors which are in conflict with his own personal values and experiences in order to meet the expectations of the mainstream culture. College students are, in general, ideal therapy candidates. The ethnic students who find their way to campus counseling centers and clinics are usually  responsive also, but this probably has to do with a process of self-selection--the ethnic students in therapy being for the most part already heavily invested in a middle-class life style. Attempts at \"outreach\" or \"intervention\" may be appropriate in a number of settings, including university counseling services. For example, it has been suggested that psychologists become actively involved in designing programs to increase faculty and administration awareness of the problems and needs of ethnic students.

A &quot;culture specific&quot; test is used to determine the taker's ability to function symbolically or to think in terms of his own culture and environment. A combination of dialect specific and culture specific tests would certainly enhance the possibility of measuring what is inside the black child's head; this is the basic rationale for the BITCH-100. Over two years, a 100-item test was developed. The purpose of the first experiment was to demonstrate that the test would discriminate black from white takers. One hundred white and 100 black high school students ranging in age from 16 to 18 years, half from low socioeconomic levels and half from middle  income levels, from the city of St. Louis took the BITCH-100. The black group showed a clear superiority over the white group. The distribution of scores approximated a normal distribution in which blacks comprise the upper half, whites the lower half. Twenty-eight black Neighborhood Youth Corps high school &quot;drop outs&quot; were administered the BITCH and the California Achievement Test in the second experiment. The results confirm the hypothesis regarding the sensitivity of the BITCH in picking up &quot;intellectual indicators&quot; not commonly found in conventional tests. (Author/JM)",

Baseline data were collected for classroom verbal interaction patterns, student opinions, and student leadership status. Student achievement data were also available through the regular testing program of the Kalamazoo Public Schools. The purpose of the Phase II study was to make longitudinal comparisons based on data collected prior to desegregation during Phase I and data collected after approximately one year of desegregation in  the spring of 1972. Comparisons were based on measures of the following variables: (1) classroom verbal interaction patterns; (2) student opinions; (3) student leadership status; and (4) student achievement. Additionally, parent opinions pertaining to desegregation were studied. In Spring 1971, the Kalamazoo Public School system was in a unique position in that it was the only school system roughly representative of the black-white racial composition of the United States to attempt system-wide desegregation through two-way busing.

The first of these measures is the &quot;Student Transportation Moratorium Act of 1972,&quot; which would freeze such court-ordered busing in its present position in order to give the Congress time to consider and adopt a long-range solution to the problem. The second measure is the President's proposal for such long-range solution: the &quot;Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1972.&quot; Because they represent new approaches, these proposed statutes raise questions of constitutionality for which there are no firm, clear answers. Discussions must proceed by taking bearings from a few  more or less analogous matters in the past and, even more importantly, from considerations of sound constitutional policy. Such analysis indicates that Congress probably has the constitutional power to enact the statutes proposed by the President. These measures, properly construed, do not attempt to overturn the relationship between the legislature and the judiciary. They deal with remedies and do so in a limited way. Because there are few direct precedents in this area, any responsible legal judgment must necessarily be qualified. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The Nation's 1973 child nutrition agenda has five items. (1) Of first concern must be the fulfillment of America's pledge to feed a free or reduced price lunch to every hungry child. A serious assault is required on the problem of facilities: some 18,000, or about 17 percent, of the Nation's schools lack lunchroom and kitchen equipment. (2) The nutritional adequacy of the food provided by the lunch program must be evaluated. With local school officials far more vulnerable to the pressure of both the vending machine industry and the children, there is a tremendous likelihood that the next year will witness a boom in competitive non-nutritional foods in the school lunchroom. (3) The universal school lunch concept ought to be fully aired. Senator McGovern has proposed a pilot  program to run for two years at a cost of 15 million dollars. The principal issue that needs to be resolved before we can jump head-long into a nationwide program is simply this: with pressing social needs of many kinds facing the Nation, are the benefits that might accrue from such a program worth the cost? (4) The school breakfast program should be rapidly expanded. (5) The field of nutrition education should be explored. From the medical schools of the Nation on down to our kindergartens, there is a shocking absence of nutrition education programs. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The first section of this issue of the Bulletin has to do with public service employment, a poorly understood social policy which must be defined before it can be evaluated as an anti-poverty strategy. The term public service employment (PSE) refers to the policy of using government funds to create jobs which serve a dual purpose: that of (1) providing paid employment for those unable to find work in the private sector of the economy, and (2) expanding vital services to people. Promising but surprisingly unnoticed legislative proposals seek to broaden, expand, or extend the Emergency Employment Act of 1971. The major criteria for evaluating PSE proposals include permanence, size, hiring preferences for the disadvantaged, community participation, and potential for upgrading. The  second section is a digest of a longer report, &quot;A Survey of Inservice Education Workshops.&quot; To understand past practices in inservice desegregation workshops, the authors examined a large body of Title IV, E.S.E.A. workshop reports. These workshop reports offer a body of knowledge about the design and effectiveness of holding small-group learning experiences to deal with the multiple and complex intellectual and human relation problems of school desegregation in an atmosphere of social change.

        "description":"This paper uses the data from the 1966 Educational Opportunities Survey (EOS) to investigate regional and racial inequalities in education by applying a definition of inequalities that incorporates both school inputs and educational outcomes. Inequalities in school inputs are weighted by their importance for educational outputs, in order to empirically assess the extent and source of inequalities experienced by different racial and regional groups. A particular racial or regional group is said to experience inequalities relative to another group if its educational achievement is shown to change significantly when its own school inputs are replaced by the school inputs of the other group, while retaining its own family resources. Multiple regression techniques are used to obtain  estimates of predicted average achievement for a racial or regional subgroup when they are assigned the average school resources from another group. The difference between the observed mean achievement and the predicted average achievement indicates the degree and direction of the inequality. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Although many public schools are nominally desegregated, the interaction among students of varying racial and ethnic backgrounds is minimal. Desegregated schools need to restructure the classroom in order to create more positive and constructive relationships among students from varying backgrounds. The present study investigated the restructuring of seventh grade mathematics classes by means of student teams and instructional games. The study examined how this restructuring affected cross-race and cross-sex selection by students of their helpmates and friends. The subjects were 115 seventh grade students at a large urban junior high school; 43 percent of the students were blacks, and 47 percent were males. A two by two randomized design was used manipulating Task and Reward.  Placing students on heterogeneous four-member student teams created significantly greater cross-race and cross-sex helping and friendship. Playing the instructional game had a marginal effect on cross-race helping only; however, the game-team combination increased considerably the incidence of cross-race and cross-sex interaction over that of games alone.

Two sixth-grade classes (one from a low- and one from a medium-ability school) and two eighth-grade classes (one low- and one medium-ability) served as experimental groups. Four similar classes comprised the control groups. Three subtests from the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking were administered to all subjects (Ss) as pretests. After about four weeks of training (one class hour on each of about 20 days), another form of the Torrance Test was given,  along with a 20-item attitude questionnaire for all Ss, plus two other instruments just for students and teachers in experimental classes. Despite the finding that both the training materials and the testing instruments were difficult for many of the Ss to read and thoroughly comprehend, most students and teachers felt that students had benefited from the creativity training experience. Two experimental classes showed modest gains in Torrance Test scores. (Author/JM)",

A description of the population below the low-income level in 1971 and some analysis of  changes in the composition of this population over the past year and since 1959 are included. Families and unrelated individuals are classified as being above or below the low-income level, using the poverty index adopted by a Federal Interagency Committee in 1969.

Primary attention is given to the mayoralty in an attempt to ascertain the effectiveness of his power in education. This research analyzes his role by eliciting the actual operations of decision making (participants involved, exertion of power, wielding of influence, and the where and how of conducting negotiations); identifying and assessing common and unique characteristics in each crisis; and integrating the findings to increase our store of knowledge about urban educational governance. These studies of the administrations of Mayors LaGuardia, Wagner, and Lindsay demonstrate that politics and education have been closely intertwined in New York City's history. The mayor  has usually played a prominent role in educational crises, for when problems arose, the citizenry, along with the crisis participants, looked to the mayor for direction and solutions. Mayors have usually been rendered powerless when trying to shatter the education-sans-politics myth openly. Education has become an integral part of urban life closely tied to the politics of the city. Educational leadership and responsibility have been lacking in the educational community. Educational governance in the future will be effective only when its officials are able to lead, account, negotiate, and compromise. (Author/JM)",

In order to evaluate student attitudes and morale, three students with the highest, lowest, and median grades were interviewed. The curriculum was evaluated  and recommendations for program improvement were included. The program objectives, together with methods of accomplishment, are included. (AG)",

        "description":"Prompted by the widespread use of the metric system by most major industrial countries of the world, the United States Congress in 1969 initiated the passage of a bill authorizing the research and investigation of metrication to determine the worldwide impact of its use on this country so as to decide which route it should take. Data were obtained from personal interviews with public officials in Kentucky and California, chosen for their representativeness of location, size, and council staff proximity. An analysis of the findings revealed that: (1) the pressure within States to change due to worldwide metrication is limited; (2) there exists no extensive use of the system at present except in laboratories, pharmaceuticals, testing, and some journal reports; (3) contact with  foreign countries and their metrically engineered products is small; and (4) more study and planning of the system is needed. States generally do not favor conversion; therefore, any initiation of change to the system will probably come only from pressure exerted from the Federal level. Highway, transportation, and other similar agencies who perform engineering functions will perhaps have the hardest adjustments to make. (SN)",

        "description":"Mounting concern over the seemingly high drop-out rate among the nation's teenagers, coupled with the inability of many high school students to select satisfying careers upon graduation, have prompted a restructuring of the curriculum around the developmental needs of students. A comprehensive educational program having seven basic operational characteristics, career education begins with the entry of the child into a formal school program and continues into the adult years. Job-related information is integrated into the existing curriculum on all grade levels. The lack of a clear-cut definition of career education other than the operationally adopted one has motivated the initiation of an implementation model for use with the program. To be developed by the Center for Vocational  and Technical Education at Ohio State University in conjunction with six school districts, the model when completed will consist of components, systems, and packages field-tested in the cooperating school districts. Implications for technical education within a career education context are: (1) The student entering a post-secondary technical program will be a better prepared, more goal-oriented student; (2) Career choices will have been made from better data and will be based on personal needs, aspirations, and abilities; and (3) Because entering students are better prepared, there should be fewer dropouts, transfers, and failures.

Coordinated by an occupational resource specialist in each LEA, the team's orientation was accomplished at a 1-week summer conference and 4-week workshops in each LEA. Preliminary planning was done for developing a career education resource center and integrated career education curriculums for handicapped students. Behavioral objectives and performance objectives are being developed and  examined, a pilot demonstration unit will be presented in October 1972, and community support is being enlisted. Short courses for in-service training and pre-service college courses have been developed.

Realizing the need for such training, Federal ad State laws have been initiated to increase the development and insure the proper operation of such programs. Presented in this report are legislative laws regulating registration, promotion, maintenance and service, completion requirements, veteran eligibility, and a list of those trades classified as apprenticeable by the State of New York. Appendixes listing program data on existing apprentice training and  instruction are included to facilitate further comprehension. (SN)",

The project demonstrated that a positive reinforcing environment and properly structured work situation will provide a means of behavior modification for parolees and other disadvantaged persons. Program tasks included job development, training supervisors and counselors, counseling the hard-core trainees, and evaluating the effects of the reinforcement experimentation on the work behavior of the subjects. It was found that the application of social reinforcement to juvenile parolees and adult disadvantaged resulted in greater employment stability, better  productivity, and less recidivism. As the key to job performance is supervision, the primary focus of the project was on the supervisor.

Of the 2,563 useable interviews, equal numbers of firms were chosen according to these factors: (1) small, medium, or large size, and (2) industrial classifications for nonmanufacturing businesses, including agribusiness, mining, human services, construction, human and producer services, finance, transportation, communication, and related areas. A national program for  metrication was seen as the only major impetus for conversion of individual businesses to SI (Systems International) units.

Skilled professional personnel were unemployed. The Aerospace Employment Project was set up as a special pilot project to test whether unemployed professional aerospace personnel could be effectively utilized to help solve the urban problems. The premise was that aerospace scientists and engineers, unemployed due to defense budget cutbacks, had background in the managerial skills needed in local government. Orientation to local government problems and jobs, career transition difficulties, and reactions of the local governments are detailed in the report. The project's primary conclusion is that  former aerospace professionals can bring needed skills to local governments that are receptive to the opportunity, but a catalyst such as the Aerospace Employment Project is necessary to bring the parties together for their mutual benefit.

About 56 occupational modules were developed, and 38 were tested in the participants' schools and other pilot Arkansas schools. The materials were reproduced in booklet form after necessary changes, revisions, and evaluation. Occupational information was secured by interviewing students, parents, and local employees and used in preparing these integrated career awareness packets for a social studies  curriculum. Audiovisual aids, bibliographies, and resource materials were gathered and reviewed prior to statewide dissemination of the packets for use by elementary teachers during the 1972 school year.

        "description":"The purpose of this annual report is to evaluate a demonstration project in vocational counseling for urban youth which is composed of four major elements: (1) a career orientation program for preadolescents, (2) a cooperative work experience program for students enrolled in vocational skill development at the secondary level, (3) a job placement program for high school graduates, and (4) a counseling and training program to serve high school students who are not enrolled in vocational programs. Encompassing activities under the Occupational Vocational and Technical Education Training Division of the Pittsburgh Public Schools, these four functional components were selected from a comprehensive occupational guidance program for the elementary and secondary grades. This program  review presents a project summary with recommendations, together with detailed descriptions of the three phases of the career orientation programs and the other program components. Although the programs function efficiently, the reasons why 5.2 percent of the 1971 graduates were not placed should be studied in order to remedy the situation. Various tables present the data, and extensive resource materials are appended. (AG)",

Specifically concentrating on an integrated vocational curriculum for Grades 9 and 10, teacher-developed units were designed to orient Grade 9 students to the area vocational school and to the world of work. Students were given aptitude tests, and teaching techniques such as field trips, human resources, and audiovisual aids were employed. Post-testing after the 10-week orientation revealed student vocational interests, and the program evaluation indicated a need for an expanded vocational curriculum for Grade 10. Seven hours of inservice credit were given to the teachers,  guidance counselors, consultants, and coordinators involved in curriculum development. A committee for program review and an advisory council acting as consultants for industry discussed the units. A 1-day personnel orientation meeting was held, during which a county-wide uniform grading system was developed. A sample curriculum unit and other resource materials are included. (AG)",

It was found that the students generally lacked vocational information and were not certain about college or career plans. Although a large majority of the students indicated a need for help in career planning, little support was given to any of the vocational services proposed. Vocational education teachers indicated very positive support of vocational curriculum, while non-vocational teachers were less unamimous. Both teachers and students felt that parents should be better informed about the  values of vocational education. As a result of the survey, it was recommended that a coordinator position be established to initiate and implement vocational education services, that the curriculum be modified as necessary for those students not planning to go to college, and that planning for career awareness and vocational education services involves both teachers and students, with improved communication between parents and school.

Problems of curriculum adaptation usually center around the lack of resources and materials required to develop a new curriculum component.

The failures of educational institutions must be studied in order to produce an informed citizenry who are capable of adapting to and directing change.

The black-white differences in status transmission found by Duncan are discussed, explaining his findings by means of the Wisconsin model of status attainment. To explain the lesser dependence of the son's status on the father's status for blacks, it was hypothesized that this difference generally resided in the indirect effects of \"significant others.\" A proportionate stratified random cluster sample of 1,166 white males and 287 black males who were Louisiana high school seniors utilized two dependent variables, those of educational and occupational aspirations, and three exogenous variables, those of the father's education,  mother's education, and father's occupation. Intervening variables relating to educational encouragement, grades, and college plans were analyzed as \"significant others\" influences. Racial differences are inadequately explained by the Wisconsin model, because the hypothesis was not substantially verified by statistical analysis. Black aspiration levels appear unrealistically high when compared with those of whites, suggesting that black youths place less emphasis on the mechanisms of social constraints than do white youths. The Wisconsin model does not take this aspect into account. (AG)",

Two presentations focused on specific identification of philosophical and organizational elements for this system. A prototype of a state model for vocational education personnel development, accepted by the Workshop, utilized the following principles: (1) Accountability should begin at the state level, (2) Planning should occur throughout the decision-making  processes, (3) External inputs for the public and professionals should be allowed, (4) A research component should always be included, and (5) Review and evaluation procedures are necessary. Professional involvement, the role of industry, and the generation and transmission of knowledge were topics highlighted in numerous presentations. Especially emphasized were the special needs for developing policy, refining planning, implementing evaluation, and utilizing change agents which are both internal and external to the system. (AG)",

The courts had previously taken the attitude that the operation of penal institutions was beyond their jurisdiction, but the suppression of and restrictions on the exercise of first amendment freedoms by prisoners have received increasing judicial scrutiny during the past decade. The few successful petitions of the many submitted to the courts by prisoners have had an effect which extended far beyond their institutional origins. One reason for increased judicial concern about the rights of prisoners arose from the change in prison philosophy by correctional authorities from the concept of punishment and retribution to one of  rehabilitation. To determine the state of case law as it pertains to the rights of prisoners under the first amendment rights guaranteed to all citizens, law libraries were researched and questionnaires sent to all 50 state departments of corrections and also to four federal correctional institutions. The purpose of the questionnaire was to compare the announced policies of the institutions with requirements of the court decisions. The form used is appended to the document. (MF)",

A literature review was conducted, and a research team interviewed supervisors, vocational counselors, students, former students, parents, employers, and teachers, collecting data from seven areas in Mississippi. A lack of adequate data for formulating appropriate vocational education curriculums for the mentally handicapped indicated a need for course development. A curriculum model was organized and learning activities developed around these three major areas: (1) the  psychomotor domain, (2) social maturity, and (3) environmental factors.

Twenty-two U.S. Army officers who had served as battalion commanders (Group I) and 22 who had served as company commanders (Group II) rated 36 leader actions on their desirability for battalion and for company commanders. Battalion commanders do not differentiate between the two command levels on the desirability of leader actions. Company commanders differentiate about actions concerned with the centralization of authority and responsibility and consider these to be more desirable for both command levels. Both groups rated positive motivation and emotional support as desirable and punitive or negatively  motivating actions as slightly undesirable. The implications of the differences in expectations about leader behavior on effective organizational functioning, leadership doctrine, and training are discussed. (Author)",

        "description":"Adult basic education programs must teach the \"social living skills\" disadvantaged adults need, as well as basic literacy skills. In creating an ABE program, one must first assess the needs of the target population--through surveys, group meetings, an advisory council of members of the target population, demographic studies, and consideration of physical requirements. Population needs, facilities, staff, budget, and time schedule determine the type of organizational model used--community-based, home-based, employment-based, institution-based, community college-based, or public school-based. Instructional designs may take the form of a laboratory program, a traditional classroom, individualized instruction, a tutorial program, or a combination of approaches. Recruitment can best  be accomplished through personal canvassing, linkages with agencies serving the target population, use of the mass media and other public relations efforts, and cooperative efforts with business, industry, and labor groups. Retention of students depends on such factors as the sympathy and sensitivity of the staff, the physical facilities, a sense of social ease, and the relevance of the curriculum. Student evaluation, on an individual basis, through informal or formal testing is necessary for initial placement, individual prescriptions, and assessment of progress. Program evaluations, and changes based on them, are essential to assure that the program is meeting its objectives. (KM)",

The report of the survey, conducted under the auspices of NAPCAE and the National Council of State Directors of Adult Education, is scheduled for publication by the U.S. Office of Education this fiscal year. The survey reports on every State and outlying area, using only State-provided data. The report shows that enrollments in public school adult education have grown from 1.49% of the U.S. residential population in 1947-48 to 14.98% in 1969-70. Registrations in public school adult education exceeded the number of regular students in colleges and universities by about a million, for a total of over 8 million. The increase in instructional  staff for adult education did not keep pace with the rise in enrollments. Tables in the report provide statistics for the Nation, the average State, some programs, and individual States. Some comparisons with population, per capita income, and other education-related statistics are made. Enrollments in adult education in the public education system are expected to continue to rise, due to higher educational expectations, increased resources and facilities, and an increasing adult population.

The effect of selected training variables and training systems was evaluated, and the relationship between straight-copy typing and production-copy typing was explored. Several alternative revised training programs were field tested, and suggestions for revising the training program now in use were made. (Author)",

        "description":"The two experiments reported are part of a series evaluating effects of display parameters, task variables, and operator perceptual limitations on ability of Night Vision Device operators to process visual information quickly and accurately. For untrained observers, target brightness requirements were higher for identification than for detection, but were about equal for both responses with target exposure times greater than a critical time of 0.10 to 0.17 second. With shorter exposure times, the target brightness needed for detection or identification increased as exposure time decreased. Increasing information load and randomizing target location raised brightness requirements for identification. The results suggest that operator performance might be improved significantly by  special training to increase the observer's area of attention and his capacity to process visual information.

Exceptional adults were defined as individuals 18 years of age or older who suffer from some mental handicap, such as mental retardation, brain damage, or psychological abnormality (mental illness). Responses to the questionnaire were tabulated, classified, and analyzed. The respondents cited 26 different specific issues in education for exceptional adults. The issues fall into six categories: those that are client centered; those that are curriculum centered; those that are institutional centered; those that are personnel centered; those that are financial; and those that are societal. The range in the number of times  each categorical area was cited was from a high of 14 for the financial classification to a low of 6 for societal issues; client-centered issues were cited 12 times; curriculum issues 11 times; personnel issues 10 times; and institutional-centered issues 9 times.

Chapter I, Basic Principles for Designing a New System of Adult Education, discusses fundamental issues involved in the use of technological devices. These issues concern the expected functions of modern media in adult education and the relationship between the system and its environment. In Chapter II, Teaching-Learning Process and Technological Innovations, the teaching/learning process, technological innovations and expansion of instructor's functions, the role of  broadcasting, role of telecommunication, development of information package, and multimedia are presented. Chapter III, Use of New Instructional Communication Technology in Adult Education, provides discussions of classification of new instructional communication technology, use of broadcasting, new technology for information transmission--facsimile and telewriter, information retrieval by means of telecommunication technology, expansion of three-way communication by means of new telecommunication technology, and characteristics of new instructional communication technology. It is concluded that broadcasting and telecommunications technology is a suitable and indispensable media of adult education. (DB)",

Many problems are foreseen in relation to the way in which continuing education should be organized and defined and in relation to the types of services that will have to be offered by the Volkshochschulen. It is believed that the Volkshochschule will have to comprise a center for autodidactic studies, a national set of certificates with credit system, a program of differentiated working groups, and a forum for public discussion. The educational programs will not only consider stable matters but also  relatively rapidly changing concepts. The forms of teaching used will also need to be defined more specifically. The organizational structure will need to place the Volkshochschule as a public institution for adult education. The locations of the new Volkshochschulen should be such that each person can reach an adult education center within 30 minutes; this means that, as a rule, Volkshochschulen will need to be established in all regional centers and provided with a permanent staff, with affiliated outposts if required. The financing of the Volkshochschulen is the task of both state and local authorities. Teacher training should be carried out in close cooperation with universities. (DB)",

A three-month experiment was conducted with 99 dairy herd improvement association members throughout Minnesota. A lecture was prepared by an Extension specialist and visuals were provided so that the lecture was adaptable to both regular lecture and telelecture. Pre- and post-tests contained 10 single-answer multiple-choice questions, which covered knowledge such as recall, comprehension, application, analysis, and synthesis. Of the participants, 98 completed both tests in three telelectures, and 99 completed both in the seven regular lectures. The  tests scores were analyzed to compare the two methods, using a one-way analysis of variance, and an F test at the .01 probability level was used to test for significance. The experiment results showed that there was no significant difference in knowledge gained between the two educational methods. The use of pre- and post-tests was shown to be of value in identifying important concepts and measuring learning; the educator can provide a significant increase in learning by adult students by basing the educational method on the concepts identified in the tests, and it provides a structure by which the learners can identify concepts to be discussed. Appendixes provide the pre- and post-test as well as answers to the test questions. (DB)",

The Extension Leader should recommend for the committee persons who will balance the board in terms of age, sex, interests, capabilities, and geographic location. Orientation should be on an individual basis and be brief and informal. It is believed that training of committee members is best accomplished by their participation in four meetings held annually.

Data were collected by personal interview of the 95 Haldiman County farmers who had received a soil test report during the year ending June 30, 1971. The data obtained were computer processed. A summary of the findings shows that the farmers with the least understanding of the soil test report's fertilizer requirement  section included a higher proportion of those with the least education, the smallest farms, the smallest farm income, and did not attend agricultural meetings or activities organized by the county extension workers.

        "description":"Fifty-nine inmates, men and women, from two correctional institutions were randomly assigned to eight groups to test the effect of book discussion on attitudes. The four experimental groups read and discussed weekly a series of six titles during the 12-week program. The four control groups met three times to participate in a reading interest survey. Each leader team, composed of two librarians, led one experimental and one control group. Pretest and posttest scores on Socialization Scale of the \"Personal Values Abstract\" and on a \"Semantic Differential\" test of attitudes related to persons and behaviors were subjected to analysis of covariance and the F test. Covariance analyses revealed that the experimental groups were less accepting of Dope Addiction and Stealing, the two  behavioral concepts, than were the control groups, while no significant difference was found on attitudes toward concepts relating to persons. Analysis of interactions showed that those in the experimental groups who had served more time, had more time to serve, or were Black were affected more positively by bibliotherapy than their fellows. Conclusions: For those inmates who wish to participate and can read and comprehend, the group discussion form of bibliotherapy may supplement the correctional program: (1) by improving attitudes related to behavior for all groups, (2) by additionally improving attitudes related to persons for certain groups, and (3) when conducted by librarians working with small inmate groups.

The Ohio survey differed as to some of the selection criteria. Innovativeness was measured by the number of 10 improved farm management practices ever used. &quot;F&quot; ratios were computed between the adopter categories in the Wisconsin study, and in order to make comparable analysis of the Ohio data, estimates of the statistical variance were made and &quot;t&quot;  scores computed. Two major exceptions that occurred between the results of the Ohio study and the Wisconsin study were: (1) enterprise specialization was positively associated with innovativeness in the Ohio study, but negatively associated in the Wisconsin study; and (2) in the Ohio study, those in the early adopter category had greater county Extension contact than those in the innovator category, the difference being statistically significant, whereas the innovators in the Wisconsin study had an average of 11.9 personal visits with Extension agents the preceding year compared with 6.5 visits for early adopters.

        "description":"In the experimental project reported, the U. S. Office of Economic Opportunity delegated its resources to the Pennsylvania Department of Community Affairs for the purpose of comparing public and private sector approaches to social planning in rural areas. A private agency, Community Services of Pennsylvania, was designated by the Department of Community Affairs to supervise the work of Rural Planning Specialists, one in each of two rural Pennsylvania counties. Two other Rural Planning Specialists were placed by the Department of Community Affaris with publicity controlled Planning Commissions in two other rural areas. Through a series of program analyses involving interviews with the four Rural Planning Specialists, their supervisors, and community leaders and chronological event  analyses carried on over a period of nearly two years, preliminary conclusions are: (1) the introduction of nongovernmental social planners into rural areas can be accomplished in approximately six months less time than introducing the same social role through a public agency; (2) the selection of personnel for private planning role is more critical to program effectiveness than in a more highly structured public project; and (3) the review of proposed community development projects by nongovernmental social planners, while inhibited by their lack of formal structural ties with the public Planning Commissions, is possible through the establishment of informal relationships within the rural community setting.

The second paper, \"The Educational Plight of Today's Elderly,\" endeavors to summarize, in a way that escapes the bias of the professional educational view, some recent claims and developments related to the social change and demands of the present era that place special stress on the education of the older person. \"Problem  Solving and Complex Learning Behavior in Old Age,\" the third paper, includes a far from exhaustive review of a number of reports and writings about learning \"decrement\" in aging.

This review traces the intellectual and political growth in the adult education movement. It lists recent seminal studies in the field and presents a series of relatively non-technical interpretations. The analysis of the literature is concerned primarily with the more basic question of whether the adult educator should attempt to incorporate conceptual learning into his practice. It concludes that some practitioners may be justified in rejecting conceptual learning if it is in conflict with their basic philosophies and life styles, while others may find much of value in it.

        "description":"An attempt was made to determine the nature of the present 4-H organizational leadership in five counties, to identify organizational leader problems, and to determine methods and procedures for correcting these problems. It was proposed to solve the problems by preparing a plan that would cover the following leadership development phases: 4-H leader identification, selection, orientation, training, utilization, recognition, and evaluation. The 4-H organization leader is defined as a volunteer who guides the over-all direction of the local 4-H Club and coordinates the total activities of the club. Important characteristics of a good leader include respect from the community, liking children, and ability to work with adults. Following study of the situation the group concludes  that the basic problem concerning organizational leaders in the five counties represented in this study was &quot;lack of sufficient number of organizational leaders to do the job assigned to this leader position.&quot; It is pointed out that if detailed attention is given to the leadership development process, and if it is viewed as a continuous process, most of the leaders' role expectations will be more compatible with those held by the county Extension staff, and, as a result, the organizational leaders will begin to accept and do most of the organizational leader task.

A 15-item questionnaire and a cover letter which explained the project were mailed to 486 students who were enrolled in at least one correspondence course. Only 134 of the questionnaires were filled in correctly and returned. Three items of data were coded onto the questionnaires as they were returned: sex of student, number of lessons completed, and number of lessons in the correspondence course. The first four items measure students' reactions to their courses of study and to correspondence study in general. Results from Item 2 show that 64% of the student rated the courses Interesting or Very Interesting,  while 15% rated the courses as Uninteresting or Very Uninteresting. Responses to Item 5 indicate that about one third of the respondents did not establish a lesson completion schedule for their course. Results from Items 6 and 7 show that most students would not have welcomed help by the Correspondence Office in establishing and administering any type of lesson schedule. Recommendations include: (1) That each correspondence course prepared by university instructors be evaluated by peers of the instructor; and (2) That materials be prepared which will enable a student to plan his study schedule.

The hypothesis was that dominance of a particular type of farming in an area is signified by a set of cultural and social values that dispose the agencies serving farmers and the farmers themselves to favor interests and activities associated with the dominant enterprise, and to disparge and neglect activities associated with subordinate enterprises. Measurement of enterprise-dominance effects involved the selection of (1) an area in central Kentucky in which beef cattle production was more important than hog production, and (2) an area in western Kentucky in which these two enterprises were equally important. The survey farmers reflected in their  own enterprises the area differences in relative dominance of beef cattle and hogs. The hypothesis was supported in the following ways: (1) the agent's perception of farmers' commitments to hog production, (2) the amount of time extension agent spent on matters pertaining to beef cattle compared with hogs, (3) the relative numbers of requests for information the agents received from beef cattle and hog producers, (4) the proportions of his farm visits in which the agent dealt with a beef cattle or hog production problem, (5) the farmers with whom he most often initiated contact, and (6) the relative emphasis of the extension agents on recommended practices pertaining to beef cattle and hogs.

An intrasubject design insured both replication and reliable identification of relevant treatment variables. The treatment effects were found to be largely response-specific and stimulus-specific.

The investigation included surveys, analyses, and interpretations of statutes, significant rules and regulations of state departments of education, and court holdings as they applied specifically to sex education. Investigation and analyses of the court cases involving sex education indicated that the courts are not in accord on the question of an inherent parental right to instruct in matters of morality and religion. It appears that the courts will support the right of school authorities to establish curriculum in sex education, family life, or human sexuality so long as it is not arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or in  violation of state or federal laws or constitutions. The courts will also uphold the individual constitutional right to excusal from such instruction on the grounds of invasion of religious freedom or personal morality. (Author/WS)",

        "description":"Antecedents and correlates of interracial behavior among high school students were assessed. Separate questionnaires were prepared for white and black students so that specific items referred explicitly to members of one's own race or to members of the other race. These questionnaires were completed by 750 students in an integrated high school that had experienced several months of racial conflict. Differential rates of avoidance and integrative behavior were observed when race, sex and school class were controlled. The racial differentials were found to be slight, but blacks consistently manifest integrative behavior more frequently than whites. Past equal status contact emerged as the strongest correlate of voluntary interracial behavior, followed by authoritarian personality  characteristics and social pressures. Other important predictors of integrative behavior were prejudice, tendency to discriminate, fear of future competition and involvement in school activities. It was concluded that lack of knowledge about the antecedent of racial behavior are apparent in the limited success of programs designed to reduce racial prejudice. (Author/BW)",

The secondary purpose was to examine implications of the findings for administrators faced with this student problem. The design of the study included a combination of the following research methods: historical, legal, survey and comparative. The results of the study indicated that restrictive attitudes toward sex and pregnancy continue to exert considerable influence on student personnel policies of the public school. It was also evident that the total number of school-age girls desiring to complete their education was increasing. The following implications drawn from the findings were offered to school administrators:  (1) some repressive attitudes toward sex continue to be harbored; (2) the increasing number of pregnant students demanding an education will mandate that formalized procedures be evolved for their education; (3) in the common law, pregnant students have the constitutional right to an education; (4) discrimination based on sex, motherhood, pregnancy are subject; etc. (Author/WS)",

        "description":"This work focuses on the variations in societal responses perceived by male homosexuals in various group settings of interaction and on the relationship of these responses to their social status and related behavioral characteristics. Conclusions were based on the analysis of data collected from a sampling of 148 male homosexuals in and around a large midwestern city. These are as follows: (1) stereotypic responses are more likely to occur under the interactional prescripts characteristic of secondary groups due to their impersonal and one-way interaction; and, (2) lower class homosexuals are more likely to perceive stereotypic responses due to their closer approximation to the stereotypic image of a homosexual. It is suggested that the display of stereotypic behavior is a  manifestation of the lower class homosexual's desire to be identified with the homosexual community. This identification may provide a meaningful self definition and an opportunity for upward mobility unattainable in the larger society. (Author/WS)",

        "description":"The focus of this study was to compare the relative influence of the two theories commonly utilized to explain the development of a child's self-concept and to examine some contingencies under which one or the other process is more important. The \"mirror theory\" looks to the reflected appraisals of significant others as the important influence on a person's self-concept. The \"model theory\" holds that the child's self-concept is modeled after the images of the significant others in his environment. Questionnaire data were obtained from four family members for 219 families. The findings consistently showed that mirror relationships are stronger than model relationships. This means that the parent's evaluation of the child was more strongly related to the child's self-evaluation  than was the parent's self-evaluation. The results do favor the \"looking glass\" conception of self-concept formation, but because the correlations were somewhat low, findings are more suggestive than conclusive of the relative importance of mirroring versus modeling process.

In a time when urbanization and industrialization have led to a loss of sense of community and when even education has become increasingly centralized and depersonalized, the community college has assumed responsibility for a symbiotic arrangement among various traditional community service functions and has matched them to specific community needs in a synergistic ecology. The author feels that the community college program, then, must center around the dialectic between the dichotomies of our social mores and the rights of the individual. Specifically, local opportunities and needs of St. Clair College in Windsor, Ontario are  examined, with particular attention to a life skills course. Extensive addenda to the manual include: (1) other community programs; (2) data on the disadvantaged; (3) the instruction centres; (4) the public's view; (5) the community college curriculum; (6) admission procedures; (7) evaluation procedures; (8) problems being faced locally; and (9) a selected bibliography.

Since rehabilitation clients are stigmatized as unpleasantly different, and dealing with them is therefore considered \"dirty work,\" it has been difficult to recruit rehabilitation workers as agents of social control. Data from a sample of rehabilitation counselors show that even some of these workers agree that clients are physically unpleasant and persons who have a disability are over-represented in this occupational group. Data from a sample of college students reveal variations in possible acceptance of rehabilitation clients on the basis of sex, race and occupational  values with females, Blacks and those with people-oriented values the most accepting. Implications of the interactions of the staff and client stigma for manpower recruitment in the field are discussed. (Author)",

The research reported in this paper attempted to expand on this research and examined the reactions of both black and white students when their performance was not equal. It also examined the effects of black power on performance and self-deprecation. Finally, it attempted to examine more fully white students'  reactions to competition with black students.

An instrument designed to deal with these attitudinal dimensions was administered to a sample of 350 college students. The results of the research tended to be mixed in terms of the affective-cognitive model.

A random sample of teachers, parents, police, mental health clinic workers, ministers, and high school students (both drug users and non-users) were interviewed and tested to ascertain their attitudes and knowledge regarding drugs. The findings are that drug users, in addition to being much more knowledgeable about drugs than non-users, encounter quite different problems related to drug use than non-users might imagine. Evidence indicates that users are very aware of the fallacy of considering \"drugs\" in a general, all-encompassing way, and instead make sharp distinctions between drugs. Non-users continually fail to do this. The report concludes that prevention and educational programs should take into  consideration both a large attitudinal difference and a certain sophistication among drug users, even at the high school level. Particular problems and areas of ignorance are noted in order to aid in establishing more realistic, efficient, and effective organization, staffing, and operation of programs. (Author/WS)",

Three images of the deviant suggested by the labeling approach are examined: the deviant as outsider, the oversocialized deviant, and the deviant as convert. Each of these images is discussed in terms of its consequences for the elaboration and refinement of a theory of deviance.

        "description":"The present study is a continuation of a series of studies dealing with predictions of future daily behaviors. Because of the finite nature of time, people have to make choices among activities, bearing in mind the duration of such activities. The dimension of \"discretion\", which deals specifically with the duration of time a person spends on an activity, is introduced as a determinant of action; this is in contrast to the findings of earlier studies which credited the stability and rountinization of an individual's social life as the best predictor of stability of behavior in that position. Research was done with senior classes in sociology during the first week of a new semester and again halfway through that semester in an effort to determine the subjects ability to predict  what they would do during the next day. Data show that leisure and social activities are most flexible in that they are included and dropped most frequently in a day and that they are also least well predicted with respect to time. The author feels that his findings lend further support to the concept of discretion as the central dimension to the measurement of leisure. Weak support is given to the contention that the routinization of social life as measured by length of time spent in a position reduces the errors in predicting future behaviors.

Although sex-related regularities may be used as guidelines for initial predictions of behavior, the author emphasizes further examination of situational characteristics which may or may not elicit the expected normative behavior. Two categories of literature on helping behavior are reviewed: direct intervention studies and response to a direct request studies. The results of the author's own study of differentiated  male-female behavior are also presented. These indicate that simplification of research on helping behavior differentiated by sex in order to gain predictability could be followed by more complex studies in which a variety of situational variables can be explored.

People of different ages who had served as VISTA volunteers were asked the same questions during the same period of time. Relationship between the VISTA experience and select social and political attitudes was determined. Analysis of the data show generally greater disenchantment and alienation of the younger volunteer. More specifically, when a comparison is made between those under and over age 30, issues that revolve around the integrity, morality, intent, and procedures of our government and social institutions point  up significant generational differences. These differences are interpreted in several ways: (1) the younger volunteers' pre-disposition toward alienation; (2) the youths' relative lack of experience as individuals working within a bureaucratic system; and (3) the fact that the older volunteers have been integral parts of the very same social institutions which the young attack.

It is hypothesized that interacting groups who are aware of a help-demanding situation actually focus the responsibility and, therefore, take action as a group more rapidly than will a non-interacting group. Evidence is gathered in a contrived help-demanding situation employing a 2x3 (sex X condition) in which three conditions--alone, non-interacting groups, and interacting groups--are used. The evidence substantiates the major hypothesis. Speculation is also presented concerning the relationship of the \"alone\" condition to the interacting and non-interacting groups.

        "description":"This report outlines a method for analyzing the status of stimuli which control deviant child behavior. Hypothetically, an effective family treatment program would not only alter the reinforcing contingencies provided by family members for the deviant behaviors of the problem child, but would also reduce the frequency with which they present these behaviors which signify the availability of reinforcers. The data in this study, extensive samplings of sequential interactions found among family members, were collected in the home of an extremely disruptive boy. The analyses of these data were then used to illustrate shifts in stimulus control produced by a family intervention program; the data showed the parents to be only moderately effective in reducing the rate of deviant child  behaviors for their problem child. However, there were changes from baseline through follow-up in the number of social behaviors which served as controlling stimuli for noxious behaviors; and, as treatment progressed, those stimuli which did significantly control deviant behaviors were also presented at lower densities. Presumably, these changes were largely the result of the parents' success in altering behaviors of the younger sister which had provoked deviant responses from the problem child. Findings suggest that analysis of stimulus control may constitute a subtle description of changes in family structure. (Author/SES)",

The person can be regarded as a consumer allocating his income among a set of goods which he must purchase in quantities which will maximize his utility. An increase in utility can come either from an increase in expenditure or from a better allocation of resources. Results of an unlimited-choice sociometric questionnaire administered to 1204 boys at eight junior high schools showed that the size of a boy's set of acquaintances was largely a function of the school's population turnover rate. Well-liked boys received the same number of choices as others, but had a higher proportion of reciprocated responses.

Ten minute counseling sessions with coached clients were taped before and after the practicum. Three independent judges rated the tapes, using Carkhuff's scales for \"Gross ratings of facilitative interpersonal functioning\" to assess the level of facilitative conditions offered by the trainees, and the trainees' action orientation (Carkhuff, 1969). Results indicated that: (1) the judges' ratings from pre-test to post-test increased significantly for the Monitor-modeling group, but not for the Immediate-feedback group; (2) although the results approached significance, there were no significant differences between the two groups on the post-test; and (3) the amount of  growth from pre-test to post-test was significantly greater from the Monitor-modeling group. Since the ratings used in this study were considered to be a more accurate evaluation of facilitative skills than the global ratings used in a previous study with similar results, these data lend further support to the relative effectiveness of Monitor-modeling supervision.

This outcome may be described by a difference equation, where the gain is a function of the prestige and income of the job left and a person's level of resources. The career model is obtained as a solution to this difference equation. The resulting age profile is governed by a parameter: b-sub-one. This parameter is interpreted to measure the degree to which the occupational structure provides opportunities for gains in occupational achievement, given unchanged resources of the individual. On the individual job shift level, this is argued as being reflected in the degree of control individuals have on their job shifts. The increment in return on resources due to job shifts is also argued to  be determined by structural characteristics. The interpretation of the parameters is tested with satisfactory results.

Naturalistic observation, the method used, encompasses behavioral-level description of events, systematic observation and recording by means of codes, assessment of inter-judge reliability, as well as targeting both verbal and nonverbal behaviors. This method is applied to therapist behavior in group psychotherapy as a first step in its verification and application to more complex interactions. The results of this investigation support the idea that many therapist behaviors can be readily classified by use of naturalistic observation procedures. These procedures, specifically designed for gathering data with a minimum of interference yet  without sacrificing either precision or reliability, retain the spontaneity which systematic laboratory efforts have often lost.

Four client behavior situations are used: independent behavior; dependent behavior; high high achieving behavior; and low achieving behavior. Numerous significant differences were found between the responses of clients which were a function of the sex of the client, the sex of the counselor and the behavior of the client. It was found that when clients exhibited behavior which was sex-appropriate by traditional sex-role norms, male counselors tended to evaluate clients by the client's success in coping with the environment and female counselors tended to evaluate clients by the clients' feelings about themselves.  When clients' behaviors were not sex-appropriate, male and female counselors reversed their orientations to the clients. Many significant differences between male and female counselors were found when comparing their responses to the dependent male client and to the high achieving female client. Findings suggest that male counselors are more supporting than female counselors of dependence and high achievement in clients and that female counselors reveal their values and act upon them more directly than do male counselors.

The five month training program consisted of the following: (1) Cognitive teaching: teaching the thoughts, feelings, and action strategies associated with the high achiever; (2) in group learning: experiencing the thoughts, feelings, and action strategies through (a) observation and modeling, and (b) simulated experiences; (3) out-group application: practicing learned principles through goal setting. An analysis of the data showed that the Experimental Training Program was significantly effective in increasing achievement motivation level and in reducing external control feelings. However, the treatment was  ineffective in reducing fear of failure feelings. Further analysis revealed nonsignificant changes in grades and in instructors ratings of students. General aptitude was not critical in determining whether one could benefit from the program. A significant negative correlation between achievement motivation and external control feelings was found.

Subjects for the research were given the Hidden Figures Test as a means of identifying their cognitive styles. Half of the subjects were identified as being global, scoring one standard deviation below the mean, and half were analytic, scoring one standard deviation above the mean. A series of three experiments was conducted. In the first, subjects solved 80 conjunctive concept identification problems following a selection paradigm. In the second experiment the subjects were asked to solve a total of 24, your-trial learning set problems, while in the third they were given 24,  16-trial problems with intermittent reinforcement. All three experiments, in general, showed that analytic subjects solved more problems correctly and efficiently than did the global subjects; they clearly demonstrate that cognitive style is an important variable in concept learning. The results of these studies were discussed in relation to the body of knowledge concerning cognitive style and implications for future research and educational practice were identified.

The approximately 250 eighth and twelfth grade students involved in the study filled out a number of questionnaires designed to measure a variety of their attitudes about psychoactive drugs immediately before and after participating in a drug education program that relied heavily on the presentation of known facts about a variety of drugs. Analysis of the data indicated that the students learned about the given drugs to a highly significant degree, their curiosity about the effects of \"mind-expanding\" drugs was increased, and they exhibited an increased tendency to deal with  psychological discomfort through the use of drugs. At the same time they reacted more favorably toward the legalization of marijuana and a reduction of penalties for drug use, and less favorably toward present emphasis on a legal approach to the use of drugs. The primary conclusion of the study is that drug education is not an effective means of suppressing the use of drugs. References and numerous tables are included. (Author)",

In the study of teacher behavior it was found that the teaching behavior of the sixteen inservice and preservice teachers trained with Minicourse Eighteen changed in the expected direction between pre- and postcourse criterion lessons. Consistent differences were also found between the postcourse teaching behavior of the sixteen teachers trained with Minicourse Eighteen and the  seventeen teachers who did not receive the training. The training appeared to be more effective for preservice teachers than for inservice teachers. When the criterion of pupil performance was applied to assess the effects of the training of inservice teachers, it was found that pupils in the classes of teachers trained with Minicourse Eighteen made significantly greater gains in reading achievement over a fourteen week period.

Thirty-eight ninth and tenth grade students who were reading at least one year below grade level, had an IQ between 85 and 115, and had no known gross auditory or visual defect were chosen as subjects. Three one-hour sessions were conducted to familiarize the sugjects with compressed speech.

The results indicated that students with a reading problem had a significantly higher level of comprehension from  listening to tape-recorded speech at normal speed than from reading equivalent material for an equal amount of time. It was also found that students who had difficulty in reading did not have a significantly higher level of comprehension from listening to compressed speech than from reading the equivalent material for an equal period of time. Students who have difficulty in reading did not have a significantly higher level of comprehension when speech at normal speed and compressed speed were compared. (WR)",

The author asserts that educational reform cannot take place without even, healthy economic growth as well as reforms in state and local government. He also argues that public education in Appalachia must express the local mountain culture, not only the dominant middle class culture outside teachers bring with them to the area; that teachers in this  area should be trained to function across these two contrasting cultures; and that publicizing the right to read is not the same thing as providing the right to read.

One of the major findings was that approximately two-thirds of all the responses made by the ghetto black children on the sentence repetition task were Language Instruction Register responses. In first grade, fifty-six percent of the responses were made in the Language Instruction Register forms. By fifth  grade, slightly over seventy percent of the responses made to sentence repetition tasks contained Language Instruction Register forms such as &quot;I don't have any,&quot; instead of the vernacular equivalent &quot;I ain't got none.&quot; The data seem to indicate a steady increase in acquisition of certain forms within the Language Instruction Register.

This leaves the test user guessing as to whether the students taking the test and performing well did or did not understand the written material contained in the test. Indices of paragraph dependency for five widely used standardized tests of reading comprehension were obtained. Five tests were administered to 1200 students each, not allowing these students to read passages. In addition, control data were obtained by administering the tests in their normal format to 600 students each. Students were selected from 10 locations  covering Indiana and were equally divided over grades 4, 5, and 6. The results indicated that none of these major tests provides sufficient guarantees against the answering of items on the basis of information other than that presented in the passage. Average probabilities of correct responses with no passage present ranged between .32 and .50, well above the expected chance score of .25. (Author)",

Students were given five aptitude tests prior to instruction. Instruction consisted of reading a 1525-word prose passage. Students were given an achievement test based on the passage both immediately after instruction and two weeks later. When group means on four measures from the achievement test were compared, the differences were usually small and sometimes statistically significant. The most noteworthy finding of this study was that for students who had scored low on a test of  verbal ability, the insertion of higher-order questions facilitated learning such that they performed at levels comparable to students in other treatments who were high in verbal ability. If these findings are replicated, instruction could be individualized by assigning students with low scores on verbal ability to a higher-order question treatment and students with high scores to a question-free treatment.

Comparisons were made of the mean number of correct responses during acquisition, test trials, and retention trials for the three treatment groups.  During acquisition, significant mean differences among the training groups favored the picture groups, with simple-picture group scores significantly higher than either of the other groups. During both test and retention trials, non-significant differences favored the no-picture group. It was concluded that the use of pictures did not distract children from learning sight words. Pictures were facilitative in teaching sight words, especially those which began with the same consonant. (Author/WR)",

Both positions are rejected as inadequate because of their lack of correspondence to both theory and reality, and an alternative theory of communicative competence is proposed. Implications for teachers are discussed with regard to reducing concern for the form of language and concentrating rather on structuring optimal social contexts wherein young children may have better opportunities to use their language, thus dispelling the myth that children can't talk while recognizing that there may be compelling reasons why they may not. A brief comparison is made between observed language activities in British and  American early school settings. (Author)",

This study analyzed selected passages from three grade 4 basal reader series to determine which transformational generative rules were used in the derivation of the sentences. Reading comprehension was tested by means of cloze tests. Transformations were grouped into five categories--embedding, conjoining, deletion, simple, and position shift. Findings indicated (1) that there is a high degree of similarity between the occurrence of different types of transformations in each of the three series and among the types of transformations  that were most difficult across grade levels; (2) written language was generally more difficult when embedding and deletion transformations were present; (3) the difficulty of the majority of transformations (except deletion) correlated significantly with the difficulty of the sentence and passage; (4) the number of transformations per sentence was not a good indicator of sentence difficulty except for those added in the middle of the story; and (5) significant differences occurred when students were grouped by sex. Pedagogical implications are then considered. (HS)",

The subjects had three and one-half years or prior training in either DRA or DRTA. Twelve lessons as outlined in the teachers' manuals were taught during a two-week period in each community by the experimenter with an observer present. Twenty-four lessons, twelve using DRA and twelve using DRTA, were taught and transcribed for  both groups; each pupil response was coded on the Quality of Pupil Response Scale by two trained raters. The findings of this study indicated that the DRA and DRTA are two distinctly different group directed reading strategies. The DRTA proved profitable as a teaching strategy with pupils reading above grade level and also allowed readers to do more critical thinking. Based on the findings, the DRTA appeared to be the superior directed reading lesson. (WR)",

The minimum objectives for reading are listed by age level and in the appropriate group. The easier  objectives are listed first, while the more difficult objectives are at the bottom of the list in each group. There is an overlap between the lists for pupils seven years of age and pupils nine years of age. This overlap permits the determination of progress and retention for age seven to age nine.

The emphasis given to reading skills, sequence, and objectives has forced self-concept into the background. Thus, this paper explores the relationships that exist between reading and self-concept and describes practical applications of this relationship so that an elementary teacher can use them in the classroom to improve self-concepts as well as reading abilities. To build better reading self-concepts, it is suggested that teachers minimize the difference between reading groups. Of equal importance are the students' feelings of acceptability to their teacher, which can be  accomplished through a sharing of interests and a classroom atmosphere conducive to favorable self-images. These positive self-concepts can then be extended into the home through group meetings with parents or school-home cooperative programs. Above all, teachers should recognize that success or acceptance are products not of a set of materials or of a program or classroom organization, but of the teacher. (HS)",

This study was designed to determine whether the variable impulsivity affects the reading achievement of disadvantaged students on a group standardized reading test. First, 34 third grade disadvantaged subjects were given Form F of the Elementary Metropolitan Reading Test under the Standard Condition (allowing for impulsivity). A week later they were retested with Form G  of the same test under the Imposed Latency Condition (to control for impulsivity). This time the subjects were not allowed to answer until told to do so, and they were instructed to think over the alternative possibilities before answering. An analysis of the data indicated students scored significantly higher under the Imposed Latency Condition on the Word Knowledge Test, the Reading Test, and on the total test score.(Author/HS)",

The third paper presents fundamental postulates common to the General Open Systems Theory and the Substrata-Factor Theory. Hierarchical working systems are noted for content areas.

        "description":"Thirty third graders, divided into three equal groups, were used to determine the extent to which good, average, and poor readers depend upon two types of reading cues--Graphic features of word and of context. To hold error quantity differences constant, materials were chosen at different levels of vocabulary and syntactic difficulty. Each subject began reading first-grade level materials and continued through increasingly difficult readings until he made over twenty errors for every one hundred words he read. Errors were scrutinized for graphic-phonetic and syntactic resemblance to printed word, subject's dependence on grapheme-phoneme relationships, and location of error in response. Awareness of syntax was measured by an evaluation of the appropriateness of substitution errors  to sentences in which they occurred and by an analysis of the position of errors in phrases. Conformity of multiword repetitions to phrase structure grammar was also noted. Results revealed that on longer words the good readers were more likely to err with a word that matched the stimulus in both initial and final positions. Syntactic measures revealed a high sensitivity to sentence structure. It was concluded that the readers were distinguished by differences in processing graphemes.

To motivate the students toward \"elimination,\" the teacher can ask them to distinguish between sets of sentences, to feed back information to the writer, and to listen to their own written expressions via tape recordings. \"Substitution\" can be approached through improving the focus in the  subject and verb parts of sentences, listing substitution choices for given expressions, and distinguishing between good and weak comparisons. \"Addition\" can be accomplished in the fourth grade by reducing and combining sentences, in the fifth grade by converting simple sentences to clauses modifiers, and in the sixth grade by adding to pre- and post-modifying slots.

Chapters consider what teachers should know about language, written composition, literature, oral communication, and the theory and practice of teaching and learning English. Some topics of discussion are dialectology, grammars, misconceptions concerning the teaching of language, the  process of writing, audience consideration in composition, reasons for teaching literature, necessary literary background, intensive reading, the emphasis of oral communication in Great Britain and the United States, college education courses, measurement and evaluation, and methodology.

Eight classes of sixth grade students (representing Caucasian and black, and lower and middle class) were administered the Linguistic Ability Measurement Program (LAMP), since it provides an effective means of assessing pupils' knowledge of the operation of their language. Writing samples (a theme, a story, and a poem) were then collected under conditions as uniform and as controlled as was  possible. Seven judges were asked to rate the composition samples through an application of objective criteria. An analysis of the data revealed that middle class pupils, Caucasian pupils, and girls scored significantly higher on all measures and that there was a greater correlation between test scores and composition ratings for middle class subjects than for lower class subjects.

The contents of the book are papers from the 1967 NCTE spring institutes for elementary teachers and supervisors. Walter J. Moore examines the role of the reading teacher and points out the value of this book for directing inservice education in linguistics. A knowledge of psycholinguistics in relation to the teaching of elementary language arts is discussed by John B. Carroll. Jean Berko Gleason outlines recent findings on how children use language at various age levels and relates these findings to teaching practices. Wick R. Miller discusses the reading-language acquisition relationship and suggests that teaching methods are less  important than the child's personal initiative. Henry J. Sustakoski summarizes recent discoveries in linguistics and illustrates their relevance for English teachers. Three types of classroom problems involving linguistics and reading are examined by David W. Reed, and the reasons for using more than one English dialect are set forth by Roger W. Shuy. The function of oral language in language learning and some ways in which it can be combined with other aspects of the linguistic program are suggested by Walter Loban.

        "description":"The 11 papers in this collection deal with problems and ideas in teaching the teacher of English. The first three--by Charlton Laird, Oscar A. Bouise, and Sheila Schwartz--are concerned with the character and development of a \"good teacher of literature,\" with giving him an adequate background in literature, and with the nature and training of the humanities teacher. Three papers by John S. Simmons, Andrew Macleish, and Norman C. Stageberg explore topics in language: the linguistic training necessary for the secondary English teacher, the number and kinds of grammar he should master, and the value of teaching structural ambiguity. Next, Richard L. Larson proposes a course in rhetoric for English teachers, Ross M. Jewell tells the beginning teacher how to evaluate writing, and  Elmer E. Baker, Jr., deals with preparing teachers for the effective teaching of oral language. The last two essays, by J. Harvey Littrell and Robert E. Shafer, deal with the preparation of teachers of reading and of the disadvantaged. (This document previously announced as ED 025 523.) (LH)",

In this paper, several concepts likely to help make simulation a heuristically useful process of communication education are discussed.

The relationship deteriorated during the middle ages because of a universal decline in learning, culture, and social organization; the hostility of the church toward rhetoric as a pagan concept; and the feudal structure in which there was no system of orderly government to prevail against individual domains. The disciplines of rhetoric and law were revived during the rebirth of learning and the development of the legal system in England, but in separate and different spheres. This segregation was a loss for both endeavors. The era since 1920, however, has witnessed the first signs of a trend toward the recognition of the role that rhetoric and law can play in association with each  other. Legal realists have broken the ground for a broader view of the factors that contribute to an understanding of the legal system, and lawyers and judges are becoming aware of their problems in communication and rhetoric.

Two major suggestions are advanced that will facilitate the quest for viable theory of speech communication. First, research should begin to focus on relevant communication behaviors rather than merely using them as convenient contexts to test selected theories. Second, researchers should be required to report the degree of association between the selected independent variables and the dependent communication behaviors. Unless these suggestions are adopted, it is the authors' contention that the quest for viable theories will be hindered. The incorporation of the suggestions will assist the field to (1) compare theories in terms of their ability to predict  communication behaviors, and (2) construct viable theories of communication behavior.

        "description":"Despite the educational value of the intercollegiate debating experience in itself, tournaments do not inspire an impressive degree of participation unless there is a catalyst of competition with the prospects of rewards to the better teams. Procedures conducive to the realization of this goal are featured at most debate tournaments, in the form of elimination rounds with trophies awarded at the conclusion to the winning teams and most talented speakers. Before the elimination rounds begin, however, there is a procedural double-standard in the &quot;preliminary&quot; rounds. Tournament directors are not consistent in procedures for conducting preliminary rounds, but use random matching, presetting, high-low matching, high-high matching, or alternate high-high and high-low power-matching.  Coaches indicate, however, that the method of matching has significant bearing on which teams advance to the elimination rounds and the quality of those teams. In judging the principle types of power-matching on the criterion that teams who do well should be rewarded, the conclusion is that high-low matching procedure best meets that criterion. The rules of this procedure are outlined. (Author/RN)",

It reports the results of an experimental study designed to assess the effect of audience response on observers' judgements of a communicator's speaking ability and credibility. Differences in observers' attitudes as a function of audience response was also assessed. The experimenters employed a 2 X 3 factorial design--a factor of observer ego involvement including two levels (high and low) and an audience response factor with three levels (positive, negative, and neutral). The same basic design was used for all criterion measures: speech rating, credibility, and attitude change. Audiences of five members were selected from speech courses at Washington State University and trained to exhibit positive, negative, and  neutral nonverbal feedback at predetermined points to the selected speech. Video-tapes were made of the three separate feedback sessions and the communicator tape made in an empty room was superimposed upon the audience tapes. Ten observers, also Washington State students, then responded to each of the completed tapes. No significant differences were obtained for any comparisons. The artificiality of the experimental conditions was considered to be the most likely cause. (Author/LG)",

The author provides definitions of satisfying social interactions in both empirical and value-oriented terms and further attempts to determine behaviors that both contribute to and inhibit the attainment of satisfying outcomes. Reviewing relevant literature, the author infers that the dimensions of independence and involvement may be fundamental factors in interpersonal communication. He defines independence as the degree to which interpersonal decision-making is self-imposed in contrast to an external locus of control. He defines involvement as the degree to which behavior shows concern or  indifference towards others. It is hypothesized that behaviors leading to an appropriate balance of these two factors contribute to satisfying social interaction. The reported study lends support to the underlying importance of the independence and involvement dimensions. (Author/LG)",

Forty-eight college age discussants were observed in groups of four during twelve 30-minute sessions. Permitted only visual input, eleven previously trained observers recorded four areas of kinesic communication--dynamism, alertness, involvement, and participation. Simultaneously, with only auditory input, ten other trained observers rated the discussants on three verbal variables--group goal facilitation, individual prominence, and interpersonal relations. Finally, the discussants rated each other \"on the amount of influence each had in the group.\" The experimenter presents three major conclusions: (1) of all the  seven variables analyzed, participation, dynamism, and individual prominence (in that order) relate to leadership perception; (2) among the kinesic variables, participation and dynamism appear to influence leadership perception; and (3) among the verbal variables, individual prominence and group goal facilitation appear to influence leadership perception.

Gouran in \"Research in Speech Communication: A Study of Process or  Processes?\" views speech communication as a \"series of processes rather than as a unitary process,\" and suggests that research be oriented to that view. In the final paper, \"A Receiver Focus in Speech Communication Research: Trends and Recommendations,\" Charles U.

He cites studies that reveal extra-legal constrictions on public broadcasters, such as: (1) the lack of a permanent financing plan, (2) the lack of hope that sufficient funds will be provided, (3) the background of those involved in public broadcasting, (4) varied views on the mission of public broadcasting, and (5) the small  size of the public broadcasting audience.

The author then uses the response to this crisis in foreign relations as an illustration of the function of international broadcasting in providing free flow of information across national borders. He describes the functions of the British Broadcasting Corporation, the Voice of America, and Radio Free Europe; then, he analyzes the responses of these three systems to the Czech situation as well as the resultant Soviet attempt to prevent the free flow of information. One justification for international broadcasting is to stimulate individual decision-making by  broadening access to information and expression of controversy. The author contends that the governmental reforms in Czechoslovakia, which included freer flow of information, caused the Soviets to fear a lessening of their influence and thus prompted the 1968 invasion.

Competing for a school district's public relations department time and resources are the public demands for accountability and curriculum revision and their obdurate stands against tax increases and desegregation. Under these conditions, it would seem proper for a school district to reevaluate its public relations program. This publication, intended primarily for educational administrators, presents an analysis of recent literature dealing with public relations between the school and the community. The author investigates many areas of public relations programs, such as recognizing the public's need for information, staffing and designing the program, assessing community  attitudes, and selecting methods of informing the public. Also considered are some ways in which a public information program can be tailored to specific groups within the community. A 64-item bibliography is included. (Author)",

Conventional classroom and laboratory &quot;eggcrate&quot; arrangements are giving way to open areas facilitating both group and audiotutorial learning.

For the first time in many years, debt service and capital outlay expenditures actually declined on a per pupil basis. No change in either voter preferences or inflationary trends appear imminent. If needed school facilities are to be built, it is clear that alternative means of financing school construction must be found. Solutions to the problem of financing school construction have been suggested by several experts in the field. The most thorough analyses of the problem have been made by the National Educational Finance Project and the Educational Facilities Laboratories. These and other  analyses are reviewed along with bibliographies on the subject. Nine of the documents contained in this review are available through the ERIC Document Reproduction Service.

Findings indicate that (1) the transfer policy has been utilized primarily by high socioeconomic status parents; (2) parents most often requested student transfers at the time of relocation to allow their children to remain in the schools they had previously attended, to place their children in particular schools' programs, or to have their children  attending schools whose locations were preferable; (3) school officials, guidance counselors, friends, and central office personnel were most frequently the sources of information about the transfers; (4) parents were largely satisfied with their children's present school situations; and (5) data was insufficient to determine whether students in the district had become more or less homogeneously grouped as a result of the transfers.

The author discusses the distinction between schooling and education, the biological necessity of education, and the organization of education. He considers four criteria of education that translate into adaptation, participation, creative contribution, and constructive transformation of the enrironment. These four criteria are seen to occupy different focus centers in schooling, depending on the age of the individual. The author argues that, although schools can be expected to do a reasonably good job with regard to helping the individual adapt to and participate in the environment, present institutional conservatism is  educationally restrictive and prohibits the constructive transformation of the environment. The paper concludes by suggesting that schools could more effectively meet the total demands of education by improving the competency of educators through changes in the methods of their selection and training.

The author argues that, to make individualized instruction work, curriculum must be reorganized and materials repackaged to provide teachers with the management tools necessary for success. Specific aspects of instructional change recommended and discussed are (1) detailed specification of educational objectives, (2) organization of methods and materials to attain those objectives (including a variety of paths for attaining a mastery of any given subject), (3) establishment of a procedure for diagnosis of student achievement in terms  of educational objectives, (4) scheduling of individual daily evaluation and guidance of each pupil, (5) frequent monitoring of student performance to inform both the pupil and the teacher of progress toward an objective, and (6) continuous evaluation to strengthen both the curriculum and the instructional procedures.

        "description":"The author develops the notion of the modern educational bureaucracy, suggesting that the decisionmaking process of the school is controlled by two authority structures -- the administrators and the subordinates. The intent of this paper is to explore the interaction of these two sources of authority and to analyze the implications for the process of educational change. In addition, the paper examines two potent educational forces that are threatening to disrupt the delicate balance-of-power relationships that now govern the schools. The author argues that the \"accountability in the classroom\" movement threatens to thrust the administrator into the center of the sphere of influence traditionally maintained by teachers, and that the \"collective negotiations\" movement is propelling  the teachers squarely into the sphere of influence traditionally maintain by administrators. The result will be a new form of educational bureaucracy that will have specific implications for the process of change. The author concludes his paper by hypothesizing on the character of the new educational bureaucracy as it relates to educational change. (Author)",

It reports evidence indicating that the principal's primary role, that of educational leadership, is being eroded as a consequence of the expansion of his other roles. The author suggests a readjustment of priorities to set the role of the principal in the proper direction. To this end, the author says, some duties traditionally held by the principal must be delegated, the concept of the principal's role as defined must be accepted, and he must be offered clearly defined responsibility and authority, and a measure of budget and staff flexibility; and he must recognize his school and community as having specific needs and characteristics. The author sees  as crucial priorities for role adjustment and redirection of energy the areas of decisionmaking, community relations, administrative structure, curriculum and administration, good order, discipline, and learning.

The early development of informal education is traced from several theories of child development and learning through its period of trial and error implementation in Great Britain and in the United States. In an effort to discover what it is that constitutes an \"informal\" classroom, the author examines selected informal classrooms throughout the country and describes how to set up an informal classroom in a formal school by the establishment of resource centers in art, science, language arts, and mathematics. Three chapters deal with the roles of the teacher, the child, and the administrator in informal education. One chapter discusses informal  education in secondary schools and provides examples of ongoing programs being implemented at that level. The publication concludes with a discussion of the problems and future prospects of informal education. (Author/DN)",

Comparative analysis, for example, maintains a formal, empirical tradition but is conducted at a highly aggregative level. The &quot;constituent&quot; approach studies the linkages among organizational components, but its findings have not been subject to much formal testing. This paper advocates an approach that facilitates detailed intra-organizational analysis while permitting the formal testing of theory. The idea is to develop a heuristic computer model that can predict an organization's structural configuration -- given knowledge of the technological interrelationships. The deviations  between the actual and the predicted configurations can then be analyzed to discover ways in which the model should be revised. An initial model is constructed using the ideas of J. D. Thompson, whose bomber wing example is used as a vehicle for comparing the model's predictions to an actual structure. (Author)",

A sample of 13 parents from middle to low socioeconomic classes identified 1,265 words and phrases they did not understand. After the goals were rewritten, parents identified only 58 words and phrases as not understandable. Based on the theory that communication only takes place when communicators are speaking from a mutually held stock of knowledge, the newly rewritten statements are more understandable than the original statements. Based on the theory of pragmatic communication, the parents are still in a doublebind position regarding such goals as those of modern math and cannot communicate appropriately their desires for their  children. Should principals act on the rating of such goals by parents, it is possible that the school programs would not reflect the true goals desired by parents. If parents are to participate in goal-sorting procedures, they need a way of indicating what they do not understand and an opportunity for further clarification prior to rating the goals.

A summary of these findings could be a valuable aid in the educational decision making process, especially to administrators working in local school districts. Research of this type concentrates on determining empirically the nature of the educational process and the efficiency with which the output of schools, however defined, is produced. The resulting information can suggest strategies for improving education by manipulating policy-controllable variables that have been empirically demonstrated to be related to some desired educational product. Questions of efficient resource allocation involve identifying which variables have the greatest  impact on the level of educational product per dollar of expenditure and channeling resources into them. The review shows how major studies have dealt with questions of model specification and parameter estimation for an educational production function. It also describes the production theory and the findings of the studies as to what variables enter the educational production function and examines what is known about the impact of each variable on the production of educational output.

In an effort to learn whether this narrow view of school superintendents regarding the sources of administrative talent was equally evident among the lay sector of public school governance, a survey questionnaire was distributed to school board chairmen in the 150 largest U.S. cities. Survey results seem to indicate that outstanding people who have demonstrated leadership ability in other walks of life may aspire to top level positions in public school administration and that community representatives who are responsible for the development of school  policy appear to be more openminded concerning the sources of school system leadership than are professional administrators.

        "description":"Assuming that education will continue to need governance at the state level by agencies responsible for planning, organizing, maintaining, and improving a statewide public system of education and that wide departmental variations will remain nationwide, the author makes several predictions concerning new roles to be played by state education departments of the future. He contends, in part, that there will be a major shift of responsibility for decisions on the methods of school financing, sources of funds, and the methods of fund distribution away from local boards to state legislatures. At the same time, he explains, there will also be a change in the channeling of federal funds -- through and into state monies rather than directly to and through local districts. The author sees  the state education department of the future as a huge clearinghouse of information that will provide a statewide network disseminating educational data to regional and local districts and one that will act as a retrieval agent plugged into national and federal information sources. According to the author, state personnel will become more knowledgeable and sophisticated in the planning, evaluation, information dissemination, and technical assistance aspects of state governance. In addition, these people will be selected from and based in large urban areas with field responsibilities to include attending meetings and organizing and directing educational seminars in regional areas.

It is argued that implementation of PPB can be facilitated by proper attention to the management philosophies of OD; and that by the concerted, coordinated use of these approaches, planning and system growth will undergo considerable improvement. The special philosophies of OD are discussed in planning contexts, and the federal government's implementation of PPB is examined for problems it encountered. A paradigm is subsequently developed that specifies more  explicitly the proposed PPB-OD interaction. The special contribution that OD can make to program planning and budgeting processes is developed in detail. (Author)",

However, the curriculum has become a program for social purposes and the school an instrument of social control when, in reality, what is needed is persuasion (not coercion) and discussion (not demands.) Curriculum should be regarded as spatial realities in process over time -- actors, artifacts, and operations in terms of that which is planned, which occurs, and is evaluated. Curricular conceptualizations should be rooted in primary attention to the learner as the major source of information in curriculum development. Because schools of the future will have curriculum artifacts more limited in size than the traditional  textbook, sequencing will be variable rather than predetermined; teachers and students will have infinite ways of bringing artifacts together spatially and temporally; and greater possibilities will exist for generating new and unique arrangements of artifacts to facilitate each youngster's unique learning needs. Systematic study developmental projects, outside the area of education, should be studied by curriculum developers to learn from others who spend their lives in developmental roles how to generalize what development means in educational terms.

This evaluation must be carried out in an atmosphere of commitment and mutual trust, the procedures and the criteria to be used must be specifically agreed upon by the board, and a job description should be drafted. One of the most effective approaches to administrator evaluation could be effected through management by objectives (MBO). MBO removes the formal focus from the individual personality and places it on job results. Under MBO, the board and the superintendent agree on manageable and attainable objectives that are aimed at the  achievement of overall goals. School districts that have experimented with MBO have found that it increases control through clarification of purpose and that it provides effective performance evaluation strategies. (JF)",

        "description":"This report describes results of a demonstration project carried out in four cities during 1971-72. The project aimed at exploring the feasibility and impact of two different forms of money incentives payments. In one form -- the \"Teacher-Only\" model -- the teachers in a school were offered a series of bonuses ranging from $150 to $600 per class per subject, depending on the amount of gain shown by their students on standardized tests of reading and math. In the \"Parent-Teacher\" model, the same bonus offer was made to teachers; but in addition, there were cash payments of $12.50 to $50 offered to each parent, depending on the mean gain shown by all of the students in their child's class. Quantitative data were collected from students, teachers, and parents at two points in time.  This data included the results of questionnaires tapping attitude and behavior information, interview results, tallies from systematic observation, and standardized achievement test results. The data were analyzed by comparing the mean of an EXP school (one which had been offered incentives) to the mean of a matched CON school in the same city. The interpretation was restricted by problems inherent in the design and time schedule of the project. Although it is possible that results reflect factors other than the incentives offer, the achievement gains observed for students in the Parent-Teacher model were substantially greater than those of the control group. Differences in achievement gain between the Teacher-Only model and the control group were negligible. Other results from the  analysis of the attitude and behavior data also are presented and discussed, but no simple patterns were evident in these results. (Author)",

The second, or background section, deals with goals  developed by citizens for the School Housing Division and goals for CSP, and describes the organization necessary to goal accomplishment. In the third section, procedures and management, the critical steps taken for the establishment of program direction and the management of the CSP project are discussed.

The data reflect the results of over six weeks of observation and measurement of operations in various school kitchens, conferences with the local school officials and food service specialists, and a review of the applicable literature. Six Ohio schools chosen for observation represented a cross section of elementary and high schools; rural and suburban communities; and small, medium, and large school lunch programs. Labor utilization was measured by the work sampling technique. In two schools, an additional day of work sampling was devoted to a separate study of  the effect of kitchen layout and equipment use on actual working time versus time spent in walking and delays. Data on labor utilization were then analyzed in conjunction with information on kitchen layout, equipment inventory, and management practices. A case study was prepared on each of the six schools, and conclusions regarding potential improvements in each of the operations were discussed with local school officials. (Author/MLF)",

Dr. L. Kohlberg's paper explains an interactional view of learning that draws from J. Dewey's philosophy and J. Piaget's developmental theory of learning stages. Dr. C. Backman considers three topics: the view of intelligence as a gradually accumulated fund of skills interacting with social experience, the effects of social climate on student performance, and the idea of the classroom as a work group with group as well as individual goals. Dr. O. Lindsley advocates the role of teacher  adviser for school phychologists and discusses how the role becomes feasible through behavioral management procedures incorporating charts and curriculum rewards. Current brain behavior research is related to educational problems by Dr. K. Pribram who also advances the idea of teaching subject matter as languages, or systems of codes, by which internal communication is facilitated. Dr. D. Blocher emphasizes the importance of the affective dimension in education. Dr. S. Sarason notes problems in teacher preparation caused by the lack of a productive theory of the change process. (GW)",

Parent interview data were obtained on 109 hyperkinetic and 135 control Ss, while 121 hyperkinetic and 142 control Ss underwent pediatric neurological examinations. Parent interview data gathered included medical history, prenatal experiences of mother, the S's infant and preschool behavior, and socioeconomic status (SES). Although significant differences between groups were found on the neurological examination, there was a relatively low absolute incidence of neurological pathology and it was of a diffuse nature, consisting primarily of soft signs. This was seen to suggest  immature psycho-physiological status, or developmental lag. Low SES was associated with hyperactivity in older (8-10 year old) hyperactive Ss; disturbance in the family situation was present more often in hyperactive than in control S's families; low SES and high family disruption scores were related within the hyperkinetic group. Findings suggested that social and environmental factors become more relevant to hyperactive behavior as age increases. (KW)",

The C. M. Galloway Categories of Teachers' Nonverbal Behaviors were employed to determine how racial characteristics and socioeconomic class status might affect person perceptions. Data indicated that EMR Ss with higher social inferential skills did not view inhibiting (inattentive, unresponsive and disapproving) teacher behaviors any differently than did Ss with lower inferential skills. It was found that race was statistically significant to one dependent variable, enthusiastic support. Black Ss scored higher toward the black teacher-actor while white  Ss scored higher on the white teacher-actor's performance. Lower class black and white Ss gave a higher score to the black teacher-actor within the helping category, while middle class black and white Ss rated the white teacher-actor higher. Lower class status blacks were found to be more tolerant to the unresponsive category than middle class blacks. The middle class black EMR Ss were most rejecting of all four groups (black-lower, white-lower, and white-middle) toward unresponsive teachers' nonverbal behavior. (GW)",

At the eight pair level, the semantic paragraph group was found to be superior in learning to the sentence group. Following their performance on the paired associate task, Ss were asked to recall the original form of the elaborators given during training. Data indicated that the  large percentage of pairs correctly recalled during the first acquisition trial at all list lengths was related to the ability of the S to store the meaning of the elaborators rather than the ability to recall the exact form of the elaborator. Reviewed was literature on verbal mediation in the mentally retarded, verbal elaboration and paired associate learning, and extensions of verbal elaboration research.

Surveys using achievement expectancy formulas were found to report lower percentages (between 4 and 15%) than speculative estimates by authorities and studies of children achieving below grade level. Differences in defining criteria, instrumentation, methods of analysis, characteristics of samples,  and quality and extent of instructional history were thought to account for the wide variations in the characteristics of children with reported learning difficulties. Recommendations such as the following were offered: variables should be selected for possible inclusion into prediction equations which minimize potential content overlap between the predictors and the achievement measures, and the criterion of disparity between predicted and actual achievement should vary according to the length of time the students have been exposed to systematic instruction.

Data on glancing behavior confirmed the hypothesis that Ss would generally show greater nontask orienting behavior in the presence  of an experimenter.

Two studies on visual memory, the developmental lag hypothesis, and reading ability are examined to show that memory strategies and the ability to encode these are important factors in visual memory and that good readers are superior to poor readers in differentiating hard to distinguish stimulus terms in paired associate learning tasks. Good readers are thought to have a superiority in perceptual learning and recall which transfers to reading subskills. Studies on attention, acquisition and transfer are examined along with models of  memory and studies on the role of distinctive feature training in acquisition and transfer. The author concludes that attention and memory are active processes which involve the use of strategies and which undergo developmental changes. Teachers are urged to teach paired associate learning as a multistage process beginning with perceptual learning tasks in order to improve visual memory skills. Goals for beginning readers are said to be accuracy and automaticity in the following successive skills: distinctive feature learning, schemata (chunk) learning, and the making of stimulus-response connections.

The vehicle and camper body were said to have been chosen according to the following criteria: sufficient height to permit an adult to stand without stooping, basic housekeeping and child care accommodations, a working area large enough to accommodate one child and one adult, and adequate lighting, heating and cooling apparatus. The program employed two undergraduate women selected because of their ability to relate to young children effectively, careful driving habits, excellent language skills, and willingness to help create and carefully implement lesson plans.  The curriculum emphasized planned language stimulation through gamelike activities such as finger plays, music, art, tea parties, sandbox activities and water play. It was reported that seven of the eight children adapted readily to the new learning environment and that the cost of providing itinerant teaching services (3 hours per child per week) compared favorably with the usual cost of providing a public school teacher for homebound children.

Twelve other children were assigned to a contrast group that received particularly explicit instructions and intrinsic reinforcement. No significant differences in learning were found among the six groups of the major design, but the contrast group was found to perform significantly better when compared with groups receiving minimal and general instruction. No significant difference emerged from an  analysis of the contrast condition with the three reinforcement conditions. Different stimuli were used in a test of transfer of training in which 32 of 34 Ss who had earlier reached criterion made successful transfers. A significant correlation of chronological age and original learning was found across the total subject sample, but not within any group or condition except the minimal instruction-no reinforcement condition.

Study I was undertaken to replicate, with controlled training times, an earlier investigation of the effects of three types of extended verbal elaboration (sentences, semantic paragraphs, and syntactic paragraphs). Trials to criterion analyses of data from 42 children (aged 5 to 7) replicated previous studies: Ss in both paragraph groups performed significantly better than sentence condition Ss. Analyses of first trial errors, however, failed to find significant differences between the sentence and syntactic paragraph groups. Study II was designed to confirm earlier findings regarding the relative effects of labels and paragraphs on learning in very young children when training  times were strictly controlled. Eight nursery school children (40 to 45 months old) were tested in labeling and paragraph conditions in a repeated measures design. The very poor performance of Ss in the labeling condition and their almost perfect performance in the paragraph condition was thought to suggest that they were not able to produce mediators on their own, but that they were able to use mediators supplied to them to facilitate paired associate learning. Both studies were found to support previous conclusions that extended verbal elaborations facilitate children's learning more than nonelaboration (labels) or simple sentences. (Author)",

Evaluation of the 142 videotapes concerned both activities performed and objects engaged. Results indicated that hearing impaired children were more active, displayed more scanning behaviors using all sensory modalities, displayed more fearful behaviors, and engaged in little actual play. The social interaction study consisted of an evaluation of three triads each of normally hearing and hearing impaired children by means of an interaction rating scale. Researchers  found that the hearing impaired groups were less cohesive and produced fewer successful social contacts than the normally hearing children.

There was little evidence of either alienation or reversal in sex role adjustments for either gender. The preschizophrenics achieved lower overall I. Q. scores, but they did not differ from their own siblings in intelligence. Since patterns of mathematical deviancy were the same for boys and girls, it was concluded that a deficiency in mathematical skill was prodromal for both genders of the cognitive disruption that often characterize schizophrenics.

The responses of the Ss were statistically analyzed to ascertain if the groups were functionally related or differentiated relative to a number of psychophysical auditory procedures. All Ss were profoundly deaf, had normal intelligence, good emotional stability, and no history of brain damage. Instrumentation included  a Beltone 150, Maico M-24, Grason-Stadler Bekesy audiometer, Grason-Stadler speech audiometer, Bruel and Kjar sound level meter, Sony tape recorder, and rubber ear inserts. Numerous tests were administered including tests of pure tone air conduction thresholds, pure tone bone conduction thresholds, mastoid versus forehead bone conduction, and occlusion thresholds. Conclusions were said to support the thesis that audiograms of deaf children could be designated as cutile to indicate a total hearing loss or classified as partially deaf to indicate some auditory reserve.

Each class of approximately eight students was divided in half, with one half being placed in the experimental thinking lab and the other half in the control language lab. Each child attended one of the labs for one half hour once a school day. The experimental group was engaged in thinking games involving classification, perspective, symbol-picture logic, and probability. The control group was trained in areas such as vocabulary, sentence structure, and  conversational skills. Results of testing were inconclusive since both groups improved on thinking skills and neither showed improvement on measured verbal tests. Reasons thought to account for the results were that the skills to be tested developed only gradually and cannot be readily assessed and that the training period was short (1 1/2 years).

        "description":"The investigation was undertaken to obtain data on the number of kindergarten, second, and seventh grade Ss classified as having color vision defects by the American Optical-Hardy, Rand, Rittler Test (AO-HRR) and two tests by S. Ishihara. Also studied was the ability of color vision defective and color normal Ss to utilize color as measured by the Farnsworth Panel D-15 Test and the Dvorine Nomenclature Test. A single administration of the AO-HRR resulted in abnormally high percentages of Ss being identified as color vision defective. The AO-HRR classification of strong identified Ss at all grade levels who had problems utilizing color. Using the more stringent criterion of consistent failure on the AO-HRR and the two Ishihara tests, the percentages of Ss found to be color vision  defective were lower than generally quoted in the literature, but approximately the same as cited for some school populations. A total of 2,476 Ss received initial testing, and 38 were found to be color vision defective using the three tests. A similar number of color vision normal Ss were selected as a comparison group. It was concluded that a factor or factors other than color vision are assessed by the AO-HRR Test when the published criteria are used with younger populations, that Ss who consistently manifest a color vision defect can vary in their ability to utilize color, and that Caucasian males manifested a significantly higher proportion of color vision defects than black males.

        "description":"Aspects of the interactive environments of 10 emotionally disturbed children (7 to 11 years old) were compared with those experienced simultaneously by 10 normal children (matched for age, sex and IQ) in the same setting. Two types of setting were examined: a choice setting in which the child was able to choose his activity from among several alternatives and a nonchoice setting in which the activity was planned and directed by the teacher. Two trained observers were used to describe the behavior of a matched pair of children (one normal, one emotionally disturbed) in a regular elementary school classroom. The narrative accounts of the observers were delineated into Environmental Force Units (EFU) based on the following six variables: the frequency of total EFU's per observation;  the frequency of EFU's per observation initiated by the S; the frequency of EFU's per observation in which the S was the sole target of the EFU; the frequency of EFU's per observation in which conflict was evident between the goals of the agent and the S; the frequency of EFU's per observation in which methods judged to be coercive were employed by the agent; and the frequency of EFU's per observation in which the agent was an adult. Data indicated no significant differences in environmental forces existing between the disturbed and the nondisturbed children and only two differences between the two types of settings.

        "description":"Reported was an evaluation of the life science program, Me Now, for the 11 to 13-year-old educable mentally handicapped child by comparing pretest and posttest scores of 180 subjects and 187 controls. Four to nine performance objectives for each of the following four units of the curriculum were evaluated separately: digestion and circulation; respiration and excretion; movement, support, and sensory perception; and growth and development. Results showed that students in the experimental group scored significantly higher on posttest scores than students in the control group on the first three units of the program. The evidence indicated that the desired student responses occurred when teachers followed the prescribed strategies. No control group was available for the fourth study  unit but gains over pretest scores were reported to be far beyond the level expected. Also reported was a high level of teacher and student enthusiasm. Information gained from the evaluation was used to revise the materials.

The objectives were to test the system for its adaptability to the populations for which it was designed, its effectiveness in meeting goals and objectives, and its economic feasibility on a larger scale. Using five areas of evaluation (soft data, hard data (achievement tests), hard data on rate of learning, data on estimated readability level of dictations, and hard data on vocabulary usage), the author concluded that the DOVACK system was subjectively favorable to other methods. However, no definitive general conclusions could be inferred for the hard data because of both the small sample size and the cultural inappropriateness of some tests. The  cost per student for the program was about seven dollars. In general this report provides a significant amount of information about the DOVACK system. An evaluation supplement to the brochure prepared for ED/Fair '72 on the DOVACK system is also included. (MC)",

When achievement level was measured by a group achievement test, no significant difference was found between control and treatment groups.

This guide specifically describes the FCC's role and the regulatory process in regard to cable television.

Next, more specific attention is paid to the relationship between automation and education--the realities of living in a technological age and implications for education. Eleven papers attempting to change the movement into a profession, written over a period of 15 years comprise a section on the development of educational technology from audiovisual to instructional technology. A final section provides a  re-examination of instructional technology and the problems of institutionalization; an assessment of some of the social, economic and political changes; and a reminder of the importance of keeping man in the center of educational endeavors.

The relationship between \"misleading, often seductive advertising\" and over-the-counter drugs and non-nutritional foods was explored. Mr. Choate was critical of previous attempts at advertising reform and points out several areas where, he said, the advertisers failed to follow through with previous pledges assuring more straightforward ads. In  conclusion, he called for more regulation, particularly by the FTC, Federal Drug Administration, and Federal Communications Commission, to tightly restrain the country's merchants from \"coveting our children's purses.\" A listing of the fifth largest food companies and their advertising agencies is provided.

Specifically, a group of physicians in Indiana were surveyed as to their use of and attitudes towards programs of the Indiana University School of Medicine which used those methods. Of 3,400 physicians who are staff members at hospitals that have access to those programs, 763 returned questionnaires which were analyzed to provide data on the demographic and professional characteristics of physicians who used those media as of part of their continuing education. It was found that physicians who use video tape or closed-circuit are typically from principal hospitals with fewer than 450 beds, spend more than 10 hours a week at the  hospital, and are willing to devote some hospital-based time for education. Some characteristics were found which distinguished physicians who said they changed their behavior after watching video tape, but no distinguishing characteristics were found for physicians who said they changed behavior after using closed-circuit live television.

The aim of this study is to explore the various means available to correct that loss, which until the advent of this McLuhanesque era, was considered irretrievable. Using cable television and telephone conference circuits in a large urban high rise apartment complex, the researchers were able to evaluate the overall citizen participation in the project, which was relatively high, and to acquire additional data for further program design. Centered on community problems, security, and the legalization of heroin, the electronic meetings stimulated dialog and interaction and also  familiarized the citizens with the rules of television access. The study was particularly sensitive to citizen critigue and was basically designed with interaction analysis in mind. In the future the project will be expanded to involve groups varying in size from 600 to 40,000 persons. (MC)",

As a result, those in charge of the technology must be sure each piece is serving a function. Ways to do this and justify the budget are presented here. Four questions should be asked: what is the present purpose of each item, what is its former function, what are the goals of the program--in behavioral terms--and what resources will meet those goals. Four resources to meet the goals are available: personnel, materials, facilities and equipment, and money. This  final resource is a result of our ability to express the first three resources. After going through this analysis, the part that each piece of equipment plays in achieving the goals should be clear, and understanding should be imparted of how a budget increases when one reviews how money has been spent, not just how new money will be spent.

The use of educational television does receive somewhat greater encouragement from school administrators, leading some schools which have both radio and television facilities to use only the television, but this difference is not great.

Problem areas which should be reconciled involve a diverse range of topics from general national policy to salary structures and conversions efforts. By using the hypothesis that the relative magnitude of most computing problems facing a country is a function of the degree of computerization (as measured by the number of computers per billion dollars of gross national product) the various stages of computer development can be detected. The evolution of computerization problems, particularly as they pertain to personnel, in advanced countries can be analyzed and suggestions can be made on the policies  that developing countries should attempt or avoid. For example, policies concentrating on developing narrowly oriented computer specialists are likely to satisfy near-term needs, but will tend to backfire later as computer applications become a more pervasive part of national society.

Because cable offers per pupil cost saving by the centralization of resources, the advantage of simultaneous programing, and the potential of two way systems (particularly useful in computer-assisted instruction), its link with satellite systems would broaden the national and regional input to the interconnection system. Though the regulatory problems of such a system have been largely solved, and technically the system is feasible, cost prohibitions (particularly the high cost of terrestrial facilities) prevent a concentrated effort to effect the system.

Working without precedents in the field of formative research practice, CTW was able to establish an operational model that included behavioral goals, competence testing, experimental production and the Writer's Notebook, a valuable asset emphasizing psychological processes, the child's experimental referents, and unbiased suggestions from the program itself. The subsequent Model for Research on Presentational Learning investigated the relationship between program attributes (appeal, comprehensibility, activity eliciting  potential) and the internal compatibility of elements and &quot;viewer outcomes&quot;. CTW found that this formative research approach was compatible with the trend toward explicit definition of instructional objectives followed by systematic trial and revision of instructional systems for achieving them.

In addition to these effects, various levels of anxiety may also be deleterious to the learner. In order to measure the effects of both distraction and anxiety 121 subjects were used in a two-by-two design experiment, defined on one hand by distraction and non-distraction conditions, and on the other by constructing responses as opposed to reading the program. Using multiple linear regression analysis the effects of the conditions and their interactions with test anxiety were determined. The only significant effect on instruction was that constructing responses led to higher achievement than only reading the material. State anxiety  was higher for all groups in which an overt response was required. The findings suggest that decrements in achievement attributable to distraction are more accurately interpreted in motivation terms. (Author/MC)",

The TABA system was designed to lead participants through a series of learning experiences for each of three essential thinking processes: concept diagnosis, interpretation of data, and application of knowledge. The RUPS system was developed to prepare teachers to solve organizational problems in the classroom and to use innovative strategies for instruction. Data were  gathered through a mail survey to both trainers and trainees who had participated in the programs. It was found that TABA respondents perceived themselves generally as in the programs. It was found that TABA respondents perveived themselves generally as utilizing their training with a high degree of regularity; training seemed to be used more by experienced teachers and less by inexperienced teachers. Analysis of the RUPS instructional system showed few differences among respondent sub-groups. It appeared that the TABA system was used more frequently in classrooms than was RUPS training.

Vocational/technical education patterns of enrollment reveal that the growth potential at least through 1975 is good, and that the most fertile area for telecommunications is in career education orientation and teacher training. Telecommunications has the most utility in compensatory adult education. This approach is in use in  rural areas of Wisconsin and Kentucky and has been considered by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as a viable means of either increasing the viewer's coping skills or preparing him for high school equivalency examinations.

Locally produced programs had fallen from 56% to 9%. Instead, the stations ran syndicated cartoons and reruns of poor quality network shows. When license renewal applications of local stations were examined, it was learned that the stations did next to nothing to ascertain children's needs and interests. In addition, most children's television shows contained no minority characters, and the ones that were shown were  largely stereotypes.

The results indicated that there were not main effects attributal to objectives, and that scrambling frame sequence did reduce achievement and increase program errors. It was expected that providing students with program objectives would have no effect in the logically organized program, but that achievement of students receiving objectives and a scrambled program should be faciliated. This  interaction was not supported by the results. As expected, attitudes toward the program were more positive among students taking the logically sequenced material compared to those receiving the scrambled sequence.

Though its instructional value has been proven time after time, the high cost of the hardware and the lack of quality courseware is preventing CAI from becoming a market success. In order for CAI to reach its market potential it must find a new educational target market. The junior colleges represent the best market for CAI because of their increasing enrollments and their intermediate position between the generally recalcitrant school districts and the graduate oriented universities. The high cost of hardware is being solved and all that really remains is for the CAI industry to meet the high-volume instruction requirements of the courseware. The production  and dissemination of courseware will require a new design and development technology with high quality standards. The author discusses the entire subject of marketing CAI in depth.

Generally choosing a film is the task of the classroom teacher or the principal. However the decision can involve a wide variety of other personnel including audiovisual coordinators, business managers, and librarians. This survey of 114 randomly selected school districts reveals that the individual teacher appears to be the most important element in film selection, with the school principal next in importance. In addition, the survey also shows that the media budget for these districts amounted to only one percent of the total operational budget. This, the authors note, is a significant departure from the estimate of four percent made by the Commission on  Instructional Technology. Finally, the survey shows that only a minority of schools have a stated policy for evaluating and selecting films. (MC)",

A central problem for such schools, however, is obtaining reliable computer service with capacity for all the students who are interested, but at a cost the school can afford. Although many schools use commercial or small-scale time-sharing services, providing computer services to more than a few students becomes very expensive. Accordingly, various types of minicomputer systems are discussed in relation to the needs and capabilities of the schools.

Selected linguistic examples illustrate how standard English is becoming simplified and, thus, easier for speakers of nonstandard English to acquire.

Some of the recommendations made by the Commission are a) school administrators should demonstrate competencies in the application of principles of sociology and psychology; b) course offerings should be reevaluated,  establishing a priority for the development of skills used in teacher evaluation; c) pilot programs for improving skills of present evaluators should be established by school districts in conjunction with the Ohio State Department of Education; and d) ways for improving evaluation should be investigated by redefining the role of principal, organizing schools along plans of flexible staffing, and expanding the role of the department chairman to include evaluation. The appendix presents a description of the following forms of teacher evaluation: microteaching, interaction analysis, nonverbal teacher behavior category system, the Student Opinion Questionnaire, Style of Teaching Inventory, and About My Teacher questionnaire.

The course also provided information on parent education. A total of 35 participants were enrolled in the initial 2 program years. The Entry Level Course was divided into three phases: phase I consisted of a 30-hour seminar on the concepts of child development; phase II was a practicum done in a day care or child development center setting; and phase III assisted the course participant when she returned to her daily working situation. Evaluation of the program was based on pre- and posttest data from the Knowledge of Infant Development Scale. This Scale measured basic knowledge of concepts  and terminology in child development. Results showed statistically significant gains for each program year. (BRB)",

These divergent views would then be imposed on the preservice teachers. The Pupil Control Ideology (PCI) Scale and the Dogmatism Scale, Form E, were randomly distributed to 100 teachers from the education department at Queens College, New York and 100 cooperating teachers in the public schools. Each of these groups was divided into early childhood, elementary, and secondary subgroups. Three hypotheses were tested: I-college teachers would register a more humanistic approach to pupil control on the PCI; II-significant differences would appear among similar college and public school subgroups but not among subgroups  within the college itself; and III-a positive relationship would be shown between dogmatism and pupil control. Results showed confirmation of Hypotheses I and III; Hypothesis II was not confirmed.

The teaching technique used was pretesting to assess student entry behavior. Considered in the study was the effect on student behavior of the instructor informing the class they had failed to meet the criterion for the mastery of some specific content which would have to be retested. The results of this study supported the hypothesis that pretesting as a teaching practice in this class influenced student behavior to seek out information after the results were made known. Student discussion after the purpose of the study was made known to them supported this conclusion. The results of the study indicate that pretesting and feedback of  results can assist students in assuming responsibility for their learning. (JA)",

Twenty students participated in the 3-week field experience program. The first week consisted of on-campus seminars which explored teaching methods appropriate for the motivation of slow learners and developed sample classroom teaching units and materials. The next 2-weeks were spent doing field work in five different inner-city schools. The participants were given the opportunity to observe, tutor, serve as teacher aides, and teach one or more full periods using the materials developed in the preceding week. The emphasis was placed on creative ways to motivate the slow learner through  appropriate laboratory and experimental approaches. Evaluation of the program was implemented through questionnaires and interviews from participants, college faculty members, high school staff, and students. Results showed a favorable response to the program. Recommendations were made for the incorporation of this program into the regular preservice mathematics curriculum. (Author/BRB)",

The objectives of the program are a) the provision for a student teaching internship that is an integral part of the cooperating public school units and b) the continuous feedback from student, college, and public school personnel involved in the program. The program achieves these objectives through: a) a brief teaching and observation period in the public schools for junior level students; b) a cooperative effort among college and county staff, instructional specialists, and teacher interns in planning the academic year; c) a summer internship of 8 weeks; and d) a senior-year project  involving on- and off-campus public school projects. Within these focused areas, the prospective teacher receives training in individualized, small group and large group instruction; the development of instructional materials; and the coordination of educational programs involving two distinct administrative units. (The appendixes include a list of program objectives, organizational charts, and budgetary and personnel information.) (BRB)",

A follow-up program for a few months after treatment is planned. Of all the variables tested, only locomotion consistently showed a main effect for the factor of modeling. The contrast was between the presence and nonpresence of models, the type of model making no difference. Cuing terminal behavior was no more effective  than noncuing.

The participants complete the program in 2 quarters and on graduation are issued a provisional certificate to teach. To help define his future teaching role, each participant a) studies a variety of teaching styles in various classroom situations and b) assesses his own personal teaching style and practices. In developing his own style, the participant selects individually paced, performance-based instructional modules. He is assisted by a clinical professor and supervising teacher. This training design allows each candidate to develop a  teaching style which is compatible with his personality. The attainment of the pupil's goals is the participants' criterion of success.

S's evaluated a social studies curriculum through a series of meetings with the director of Instructional Services.

Research done on the drug is spotty, and conclusions about the effects of its use are few. A review of current research, however, indicates no consistent beneficial results when Ritalin is used to treat hyperactive children. This may not be due to the ineffectiveness of the drug but rather to improper experimental control of factors such as age, I.Q., sex, differences of diagnosis, and the severity of illness. Another important issue in the use of Ritalin is the frequency and severity of its side effects which include loss of appetite, headaches, abdominal pain, weight loss, nail biting, irritability, twitching, and insomnia. Implications for the use of Ritalin are weighty  and require further detailed studies by physicians. (JB)",

It explored several ways of increasing interdependence among participants and determined the effects of such conditions on pupil performance. The subjects were 228 randomly selected fourth and fifth grade students. The subjects were divided into three groups. Each group was given a problem which required cooperative action for its completion. Group performance measures were obtained and related to the group's social interaction which had been recorded by observers in precoded categories. There were five experimental performance conditions: unstructured condition, task requirements, task role, group role, and a combination of task role and group role.  The strongest results were sex differences. Girls responded to the role demands created in the different conditions, whereas boys did so minimally. In the unstructured performance conditions, the girls' quality of work was better than the boys'. In comparison with other conditions, however, this condition resulted in the poorest quality of performance for both groups. (Footnotes and a bibliography are included.) (BRB)",

Expressive engagement was defined here as active student involvement in learning task. Trained observers recorded the use of PT and RIA by three third and fourth grade teachers and the levels of engagement for 30 low-income students who were diagnosed as potential academic and discipline problems. During the 5-day experimental period for each strategy, observers and teachers met to discuss strategy frequency and suggest ways of using  selected strategies. Observer feedback was effective in modifying teacher behavior. The frequency of both strategies increased while student engagement levels showed no consistent relationship to strategy use. Strong individual differences in the implementation of these strategies was proposed as a possible explanation. (Graphs and charts of statistical data are presented in the text. The appendixes include definitions and explanations of teacher strategies, student behavior, and interobserver agreement tables.) (Author/BRB)",

Background, historical precedents, and early models of this concept are explored, and a theory base is found in the concepts of a functional division of labor (specialized teaching talent) and the classical definition of promotion based on merit. Projects in differentiated staffing at Florida State University are briefly reviewed, and some conclusions are reached. Contrary to the expectations of most educators, the report finds that the immediate effect of differentiated staffing is apt to be limited, but it can lead to an educational climate that encourages change. Some indication is given that the concept has been watered-down in practice and that there has been economic confusions in the staffing variations. But, on the  whole, the report finds that conditions of teaching and learning have been improved in every case. The report includes chapters on the role of the government, states, and teachers' agencies in differentiated staffing. Concluding, this report finds that more research and developmental efforts aimed at discovering which specific teacher role and behaviors will produce which specific effects in students are needed.

This enables him to measure the predominant qualities of contact between teacher and pupils.

An attitudinal comparison also was made between teachers working regularly with an elementary physical education specialist and those who were not. The study found that, where differences existed, pupils who received the services of a specialist demonstrated superior performances to those who had not. In addition, pupils who had not received the services required  more demonstrations of a skill before they could attempt it. Boys proved superior in jumping, running, throwing, and rope climbing skills; girls, at rope skipping. But on the whole there were very few systematic differences between them.

The two critical sets of social learning variables mediated through microteaching are those associated with modeling and feedback. Microteaching is also a way of bringing specific teaching responses under experimental and behavioral control. Thus in each microteaching session, the learner emits teaching responses which are reinforced through videotape feedback or are elicited by viewing teaching behavior which is modeled in videotape presentation. The purpose of research using microteaching which mediate these variables is to determine the optimum combination of modeling and feedback which strengthens specific categories of teaching responses. The research investigates the parameters of these variables  which are most effective for eliciting desired teaching responses. Some interactions between type of response to be learned and type of treatment, modeling or feedback, have been found. Modeling has been found more effective than feedback when the modeling cues are highly discriminative. Feedback appears most effective with easily observed and reinforceable teaching behaviors.

This process can be implemented to improve the instructional process in two ways: to improve the instructional skills and strategies of teachers; and to develop more effective curriculum material for use in the schools. To test the effectiveness of an instructional method, one must first identify the specific elements that go into the successful use of that method and, secondly, involve in research teachers who effectively apply behaviors and strategies essential to this method. Most present teaching methods are not well-defined enough to permit such research. In fact, conventional teacher programs  today are ineffective because they lack definition, an effective instructional model, objectives and evaluation, generalizability, and resources. In contrast, R&D efforts have made good strides towards defining teaching skills, providing teacher access to objective evaluation data that indicates which aspects have succeeded or failed, and developing components such as minicourses to serve as resources. R&D could similarly aim towards developing tested curriculum components. (JA)",

        "description":"Multiple matrix sampling (MMS) procedures were utilized to determine the necessary parameters of a Pearson Type I curve. Empirical norms distributions were approximated by both the Type I model and the negative hypergeometric model. Four existing ITED norms distributions, two subtests and two grades, were approximated by the MMS procedures. Two sampling designs for each test-grade combination were studied. Comparison of approximations obtained for the Type I curve and the negative hypergeometric curve supported the use of the Type I curve for determining test score distributions of large populations.

Alternatives to grading suggested are: (1) pass-fail grading--minor enlargement of this option, pass-fail in the breadth requirements, in all nonmajor courses, in the first two years, in all four years; and (2) comprehensive examinations--a system for qualifying examinations for majors and for breadth requirements.

Study was almost entirely independent; students usually worked at their own rate and used the teacher as a resource person. Parental and community involvement was emphasized. Volunteers worked at the school, and classes used facilities at the University of British Columbia. Results from an internal evaluation by the staff, questionnaires, and interviews of students and parents indicated support for the program. Results of the semantic differential administered in September 1971 and June 1972 showed that students had more positive feelings toward school discipline, teachers, teaching, school, learning, attendance, books, themselves, marks  and reports in June. All changes were statistically significant, as was the increase in negative feelings about school last year. Results of the standardized testing completed in June 1972 indicated that students had attained average or above achievement in English, mathematics, and reading skills.

The self is reinforced by others who are like him, others who are important to him, others who are identification models of behavior, and himself when he chooses those behaviors that \"prove\" he is right about himself. An individual's  self-esteem can suffer when he is not accepted, when he doubts his acceptability or competence, or when significant others disagree about his worth. The most common measures of self-concept are self-report, observational techniques, and combinational methods (projective techniques and determining the congruence between self-ratings and ratings of others. A number of limitations in self-concept assessment are listed. Educators can enhance and sometimes modify the self-concept of students by: giving them unconditional acceptance as a person of dignity and worth; recognizing their special abilities and strengths, which increases self-confidence; providing both challenge and boundary for the emerging self, and providing modeling agents of behavior.

(each class having an age range of three years: ages 6-8, 7-9, 9-11) in developing children's self-concepts and attitudes toward school. No significant difference was found between the multi-age and regular classes in mean raw scores on the Self-Concept Scale and Pupil Behaviour Inventory employed in the study. In addition, the study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the innovation in promoting individualization of instruction and in encouraging children to help each other with school work. The study also sought the opinions of teachers and children in the multi-age classes regarding the innovation. The opinions of the teachers of the two younger  multi-age classes were very positive; but the teacher of the oldest multi-age class felt that the innovation was ineffective. All three teachers felt that special care should be taken in the placement of children in multi-age classes. The children's opinions were consistent with the teachers' opinions in most matters pertaining to the innovation. Finally, the study attempted to determine whether multi-age classes achieved at least as well as regular classes in basic reading and arithmetic skills. Reading achievement scores from the Gates-MacGinitie Test were obtained at the Grade 5 level, and these data were analyzed with I.Q. scores from the Henmon-Nelson Test as a covariate. Arithmetic achievement scores were obtained from the Vancouver Surveys at the Grade 3 and Grade 6 levels. The  results are provided. (Author/DB)",

Inequality may be defined in terms of degree of racial segregation, relative availability of financial and other educational resources, relative effectiveness of educational programs in encouraging cognitive growth and the development of positive attitudes toward school and self, and availability of opportunities to learn about and develop pride in one's own cultural heritage. It is argued that equality of educational opportunity implies much more than racial balance or equal facilities. The basic requirement is equal respect for different racial and cultural groups. This implies moving away from universalistic notions about  curricula and centralized control of school systems toward pluralistic programs and decentralized control. (Author)",

The total group improved only from the first to second testing session. Persons repeating the same form did significantly better than persons taking alternate forms over the same testing sessions. It appeared that the students did tend to remember items from testing session one to testing session two, but this trend did not hold into  testing session three.

Attempts have been made to place CBTE within some philosophical tradition. But CBTE is actually a theoretically based teaching strategy employing parts of teaching theory, primarily prescriptive, and learning theory, primarily descriptive. The influence of a teacher's attitudes and values on pupil learning should not be overlooked. The competencies that have been identified have been derived empirically rather than from analysis of a conception. A stipulation should be made that competencies should be stated in assessable terms or not used. The use made of the word \"performance\" and the lack of time limits for completion lend ambiguity to the concept of  CBTE. Participation in the program is described as broad-based decision-making, but to expect students to design the program is to ask for the finished product at the program's initiation. The inadequacy of the conception of teacher role and the absence of questions concerning the actual and continuing performance of those who have demonstrated their ability to perform are other weaknesses in CBTE. Of paramount importance is the fact that apparently no distinctions are drawn about the values of the various competencies. Too little attention is paid to the affective and cognitive domains. In addition, the individualization of instruction claimed for CBTE is not really individualized. The research to be done in learning and the relation between teacher performance and pupil learning are  further reasons to question the soundness of CBTE. (KM)",

In View of the role of electronic information systems today, it would be valuable to synthesize the six perspectives of administration--leader, manager, change agent, theorist, planner, and futurist--to provide a human organizational and administrative model appropriate to the age of information. A new form of administrative organization is also needed in large urban school systems. An image of incrementalism in history is presented; it remains to be seen whether the cybernetic era will prove to be something different from an increment. The crisis in educational administration is related to efforts by the administrative pyramid to maintain its  form while attempting to adept to alternative components, but this cannot be done without dysfunction. The design proposed combines a form of the committee system with EDP. The complement abilities pattern (CAP) is one or more school administrator(s) designated by the computer information system as having those abilities, preferences, and characteristics required to solve a particular system problem. The CAP is formed on the basis of information provided concerning the characteristics of the problem in relation to its stored model of the school system and its stored information about each administrator. Parameters, descriptors, and certain information about the school system must be provided for CAP to design and analyze alternative solutions and programs. (KM)",

After contacts with each of the State Departments of Education, district and LEA superintendents were asked to consider the participation of randomly selected schools within their jurisdictions. Upon receipt of approval, school principals were invited to participate in the study and were asked to appoint a School Coordinator. The Coordinator provided the enrollment and school descriptive data required for the assignment of tests and the shipment of test materials. Score rosters, showing raw scores, publishers' national percentiles and stanines, and summary statistics, for both subscores and total reading scores, were provided to each participating school. Reports  were released to schools by the first week in June. (Author/KM)",

Standardized achievement tests, which are the principal instruments used for assessing program effects, present particular disadvantages for open classroom models because of the sequence of skill development implied in the test format, the construction of items, and the content of the items. These instruments and others available do not tap the major objectives of open classroom programs. The roster of objectives for open educational programs include several in the areas of socialization and problem solving which are central to the dynamics of  the program, but, at present, do not allow for the establishment of specific measures of program effects. A description of the interaction of elements within an open classroom model is presented as a total system in which the assessment of process assumes a more important function than assessment of products represented by the concept underlying standardized achievement tests. Dimensions which show promise for assessment of program effects in an open system are discussed. (Author)",

The differences between these different concepts have affected both the implementation and assessment of the program.

Test wiseness involves the examinee's ability to obtain a high score on a standardized achievement test as a result of utilizing test-taking experience. Usability of I.Q. scores refers to the value of I.Q. scores to educators in making educational decisions. A primary reason for conducting the present investigation was to study the effects of repeated testing over an eighteen month interval. When I.Q. tests are administered over a short term, temporary sources of variance may be, at least in part, responsible for the increase in I.Q. Remembering specific items and practice effect provide plausible explanations for the short term gains. Gains found over periods of four months or less were not  present over the longer time interval of eighteen months. (Author)",

College freshman-year GPA was used as the criterion variable. Separate regression equations and multiple R's were determined for males and females. Predicted college GPA for black and white males and females were determined by use of same-sex regression equations. Comparison of actual vs predicted college GPA were made for the races and sexes separately. No strong and consistent overprediction patterns for black males and females were revealed. In the few instances of substantial  overprediction, it was primarily a matter of overestimating black female grades by means of regression equations based on high school grades. When same-sex regression equations were used, black female GPAs were most frequently overpredicted, but when total regression equations were used, black and white male GPAs were most frequently overpredicted. The greatest frequency of underprediction occurred with white female college GPAs. (KM)",

Due to their complexity and the various levels of decision-making, YRE programs require consideration of contemporary evaluation methodology. Due consideration is the use of the CIPP Evaluation Model in the development of the evaluation design. Several of the thirty steps of the CIPP Model are particularly important in the evaluation of YRE programs--the identification of the various levels of decision-makers, the writing of objectives stating performance criteria, the determination of the value of each objective, and subsequently, the determination of the priority of each objective. When each of  these steps are considered in context with the remaining steps, the resultant evaluation design would provide the various levels of decision-makers with the appropriate information at the proper time in order to make responsible decisions regarding the effects of YRE programs. Responsible decision-making based upon the availability of appropriate information should be the goal of all evaluation efforts. (Author/KM)",

Objectives help teachers identify more clearly, prior to instruction, the kinds of changes which should be promoted in the learners. Since it is easier to improve a low-density program by supplementing it than it is to delete segments of a high-density program, only three competencies for an objectives-oriented teacher education program are recommended: (1) teachers must be able to achieve prespecified instructional  objectives with diverse kinds of learners; (2) teachers must be able to both select and generate defensible instructional objectives; and (3) teachers must be able to detect the unanticipated effects of their instruction.

        "description":"The present research was initiated to investigate whether item-sampling as a procedure would yield a more accurate and stable index of student achievement during formative evaluation when compared to indices arrived at by the traditional method of assessing pupil knowledge and understandings within the framework of multiple choice testing for student evaluation. Results have indicated that item-sampling as a method for measuring classroom achievement provides no more precise information than tests of the same length constructed in the traditional manner. It was shown that item-sampling can be employed for classroom assessment without the fear that perhaps the procedure itself would deter from some estimate of an individual's performance. The research has demonstrated that  item-sampling can provide feedback to the instructor over a greater range of content objectives within the same time limits that typically provide for a narrower sampling of course related objectives by way of traditional test construction. It was also shown that item-sampling, in addition to covering a greater range of content objectives, can do so with a fewer number of items per test without losing predictive power. (Author)",

Traits of psychosocial development and extroversion introversion groupings of scales form multi-method factors that describe an educational environment in terms of task-orientation, social interaction, disruptiveness, seclusiveness, and like dimensions. The inventory consists of: (1) a self-report section that includes a list of self-competencies, occupations or skills of possible interest, and a list of possible reinforcers; (2) a group section of 26 sociometric nominations in areas similar to the self-report section;  and (3) a teacher section of 62 adjectives for checking those typical of the child. Reliability and validity studies have been made. The multiple inputs from self, peers and teachers are integrated via a computer program into a written report and several tables that describe suspected problems of children. Judgments are based on factor scores and utilize conditional statements to examine alternatives. Eight problem areas have been identified: self-concept deficits, group interaction deficits, self-management deficits, verbal skill deficits, physical skill deficits, vocational development deficits, cognitive-motivation deficits, and poor attitude toward school. The inventory can be used to ascertain the distinctive characteristics and problems of particular grades and schools and provide  clues to the specific type of intervention needed. (KM)",

Thorndike on the future of measurements of abilities, expressed 25 years ago, are summarized, and the future of measurements of abilities as it appears now is examined. Opportunities for improvement now arise mainly from increasing social concern for effective education. Measurement technology has developed rapidly and cannot continue at the same pace. Newer instructional technologies will not be the most widely used because they are costly, impersonal, inflexible, and less learner-oriented. Formative evaluation can supplement but not replace summative evaluation, and criterion-referenced testing can supplement but not replace norm-referenced testing. The concept of mastery learning cannot be applied rigorously to most tests of abilities; the learning of any  complex skill of understanding is always incomplete. Social concern is evidenced in public demand for accountability and governmental desire to allocate funds more equitably. A serious problem in the use of tests of ability is what to measure--what the proper roles are for intelligence tests, tests of general mental abilities, critical thinking tests, tests of creativity, and tests for affective outcomes. Some problems in determining test validity are created by asking the wrong questions and by not recognizing that each different test measures a somewhat different ability. The term &quot;construct validity&quot; is used loosely and with a variety of meanings. Employment tests have been questioned by courts recently, and their validity must be proved. Another major problem is that of developing the  necessary tests in quantity and at low cost. (KM)",

        "description":"The seven years since the enactment of ESEA Title I in 1965 provided a unique opportunity to attempt to find answers to unanswered questions about the teaching-learning process, especially in relation to minority group children and youth, and to students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. The flood of new programs provided fertile grounds for doctoral dissertation research on the education of the disadvantaged. Bits and pieces of research throughout the country are entombed in \"Dissertation Abstracts International\" and in university libraries. The ERIC-IRCD staff believing that much could be learned about doctoral research itself, about children, and about educational programs, decided to attempt to provide comprehensive collections of abstracts in those areas of special  interest to ERIC-IRCD. The present document is one of several being prepared for a new series of publications entitled \"ERIC-IRCD Doctoral Research Series.\" Over 700 abstracts were photocopied, sorted, and indexed. All indexing is based on titles rather than on abstracts. Dissertations may be purchased in microfilm or hard copy form from University Microfilms, Ann Arbor, Mich. Order numbers have been provided for each dissertation at the end of the citation. (Author/JM)",

Agent role functions have been coordinated toward raising the academic level of students, using two major innovations. These two structural and procedural innovations were: (1) the creation of a small group of students (target group), with the student selection based upon criteria fundamental to the scope and purpose of compensatory education in each of the Agent Schools; once selected these students would form the core group for whom a range of intensive services and activities would be provided by the Agents; and (2) the development of an educational team at the local  school level. It is thus contended that more emphasis could be placed on involving more of the parents of target group students in the range of activities and services. (Author/DM)",

One hundred and fifty-nine children were sampled representing black, Asian and white ethnic groups. Self-concept scores across groups, grades, and classroom environments were examined. No significant differences were found across ethnic groups or grades within the five concepts utilized on the instrument. All ethnic groups ranked the five concepts in the following order from high to low: me when I grow up; feelings about self; skin color; how children feel about me; school. A significant difference was found at the .05 level between open and  standard classrooms on the concept \"how children feel about me,\" open classrooms having a more positive mean value on this concept. It has been recommended to the school that programs be initiated to change the children's concept toward the school environment and that the concept \"school\" be utilized as a pre-test and post-test measurement for any school improvements undertaken. It was also suggested that the school further investigate the open classroom environment for its social effects upon children. (Author)",

However, the future for educational research in the black community has the potential to be infinitely better and ultimately more beneficial. To provide a more definitive perspective on the current dilemma it is necessary to consider some of the major problems confronting us as white researchers seeking answers to many of the continually pervasive educational issues. First and paramount among the present problems for the white researcher is the desperate need for a deep understanding of an appreciation for the cultural make-up of black children and the black community in which  they reside. A second issue is the reaction of the black child to the white researcher. The third major concern which must be considered by the white researcher is the use of research instruments and the interpretation and use of research results. Flaws in previous research do not warrant a cessation or a moratorium on research by the white researcher in the black community. Through teaming with black researchers, our efforts can be productive. The caution flag must be rung up, o# must be rung up, however, so that continued comparisons are not made between white and black children. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The High Intensity Learning Center System in Reading, funded under Title I of the 1965 Elementary Secondary Education Act, is a teacher support system which defines each student's unique reading needs and prescribes appropriate learning activities to fill those needs. It is a system that permits one teacher to manage the learning activities of up to 30 students per class hour on a purely individualized basis. The concept of &quot; accountability,&quot; fundamental to High Intensity Instruction, enables the teacher to define the task which the pupil must learn, the methods and materials that will be used to learn it, and the specific behaviors the pupil must demonstrate in order for him and the teacher to know that learning has occurred. During the 1971-72 school year, High Intensity  Learning Centers in Reading were established at 17 elementary, eight junior high, and four senior high schools throughout the Omaha Public School District, as well as in 12 non-public schools. During five or six hours per day, approximately 25 pupils were scheduled into these centers for one hour daily. The pedagogy utilized in the program defines 500 basic behavioral objectives in reading, assesses the level of competence of each child, and prescribes learning activities for each objective prescribed for the individual learner.

Trainees are given the opportunity to take an abbreviated school program, receive highly individualized personal counseling, learn about the factors for achieving success in a job, and obtain a subsidized work experience in order to put into practice what they have learned. A fulltime job placement service for those not returning to the regular school program is also available to Title I funded centers. This program is now in operation in 16 high schools in the city of Detroit. The purpose of the &quot;Manual of Procedure and Curriculum Guide&quot; is to serve the Job Upgrading teacher-coordinator in the performance of his  responsibilities as well as to provide administrators and others with information and understanding of the job. There are three main types of individuals in the program at any one time: (1) those who may be employed without a supervised work experience--these individuals may need only the counseling and help offered in morning training sessions; (2) those who need a supervised work experience--these individuals receive the same type of training as those in the first group plus a supervised work experience; and, (3) those who may return to fulltime school--these individuals usually attend classes in the regular high school in addition to the training provided for the above two types.

        "description":"We can identify black culture in terms of certain institutions and values which they share as members of an ethnic group, while recognizing that individual families and communities identify in important respects with other groups. The ascription of a humanistic character--defined as those values and institutions which black Americans have in common that are not shared by the majority of Americans--is a prevalent theme in the black movement. This view is counterposed to that of American society generally as materialistic in its emphasis. Humanism refers to a recognition of essential human characteristics--experience, feelings, a sense of personal worth--as contrasted with an instrumental evaluation in terms of success, competence, \"personality\". As an alternative to pejorative or  apologetic approaches to the study of black society, anthropologists might consider the proposition that black Americans, constituting a minority that has been, in turn, despised, patronized, or tolerated, but never granted full membership in this society, have nevertheless maintained a tradition in which personal and social integrity, as expressed in cultural, political, and intellectual achievements, are manifest. It can be argued that the circumstances under which black Americans have created a life way necessitated a strongly integrated social organization and a resolute adherence to a system of values in order to survive as a people.

        "description":"Career may be defined as a course of continued progress in the life of a person. Since in the recent history of mankind, one's life has been largely defined by the work that one does, vocation or occupation has become the colloquial connotation for career. In the social order which is emerging, work may no longer be central, but may give way to other processes as the critical concerns of life; and our concept of career will be closer to the above definition. The educational tasks faced by the United States have been greatly complicated by three revolutionary developments in our society: (1) the explosion in the quantity and complexity of knowledge available to man; (2) emerging transition from an industrial society to a technological, cybernetic society; and, (3) the emergence of  radical changes in the realms of political awareness, patterns of social organization, explicit values, and economic potential. To enable our educational efforts to match the demands of these developments, attention must be focused on remodeling the concepts and structure of education so that schools of the future will not only be more appropriately aligned with the needs of that future society, but will also be a positive force in facilitating societal transition. Society should thus give attention to five specific educational goals: (1) mastery of basic communication skills; (2) problem solving; (3) the management of knowledge; (4) employment leisure and continuing education; and, (5) self-management.

NYC Goes to Community College is a combined work and study program for economically disadvantaged youth, cooperatively conducted by local sponsors of Neighborhood Youth Corps and community colleges. The target population served by the demonstration programs was composed of NYC eligible, junior or senior year in high school, youth. Including in the 1972 summer, over 10,000 NYC youth participated in the program which grew from one pilot model in 1968 to 128 separate programs in 1972. The program model includes these components: (1) the Neighborhood Youth Corps recruits and selects eligible poor youth, pays them for  their participation in work and other program services, arranges for their transportation to these services, and works jointly with the community college in planning a work and study program and related counseling for enrollees; and (2) the community college admits NYC enrollees to appropriate credit classes, identifies meaningful job sites for enrollees, supervises their work, provides tutoring, counseling, recreation and cultural activities, and holds course credit earned &quot;in escrow&quot; or transmits it back to the high school as needed.

This report is the evaluation of the third year of operation of the program (1971-72 school year). The MES Program was designed to attack the poor achievement patterns of inner-city children through the alteration of organizational and instructional patterns across all grades within a given school. Unlike many compensatory education programs that are designed to serve those children with the greatest need within a given subject area, the thesis of MES is that all inner-city children have pressing educational needs, and that efforts to improve the performance of these children in school requires a comprehensive approach that involves  all children in all grades. The rationale behind the program is that: (1) learning will be facilitated if the school services and staff are organized and coordinated to give priority to the individual needs of each child, and (2) teachers will teach effectively if they are given the time, the freedom from non-teaching duties, the necessary supportive personnel, and the variety of materials needed for more individualized instruction. The MES Program grew out of the meetings of a committee composed of representatives of the Cleveland Teachers Union and the Cleveland Board of Education. (Author/JM)",

Data were gathered by means of: (1) a rating scale for adequacy and relevancy of college training, which was sent to the practicing secondary teachers, (2) an open-ended questionnaire, which was sent to senior students and cooperating teachers, (3) a review of tape recordings made by 16 senior students, and (4) a comparison of secondary curriculum guides and university course outlines. In general, the programs were found to  be very good in most areas, but some areas need improvement. Some recommendations for improvement were: (1) Teaching methods taught should be as specific to the subject area as possible, (2) A course in gainful home economics should be required, (3) The program should be made more flexible to meet individual needs, (4) Consumer decision-making should be emphasized in all areas, not just in one class, and (5) Students should get more drug education.

Most of the research was conducted in one of the nation's centers of technological entrepreneurship, the San Francisco Peninsula area around Palo Alto, California. Focus is on the founding of new technologically-based firms. Such new companies are rare, and the study examines the factors that create an environment in which an entrepreneur may take the step of starting his own firm. Spin-offs from established organizations appear to function as incubators to a great extent. One of the most important factors is the development of markets and technologies on which the area's  industry is based. But the individual entrepreneur, his background and characteristics, is the paramount influence. The monograph concludes with implications for established firms, implications for prospective entrepreneurs, and implications for regional economic development of factors favorable to technical entrepreneurship.

This report covers the grant phase of the pilot project. Training additional paraprofessionals to work with the deaf was given first priority and a proposed program for this training was developed. The curriculum pattern includes clusters of basic courses in both the 1-year certificate program and the 2-year associate degree program, both of which are outlined in the report. As this project was the first of its kind in the  nation, an initial evaluation program was formulated to include plans for program modifications as the project progressed. The teacher aide training program has become a part of the curriculum in the Division of Developmental Studies among the vocational/technical programs of the College. Continuing program developments and possible revisions are intended to be reported in the future. (MF)",

A random sample from each of 14 schools of the 15 in the State was used. For analytical purposes, students were divided into two categories: those actually enrolled and those not enrolled. Findings include: (1) A significant difference was found between the enrolled and non-enrolled applicants on their trade choice, (2) There were no significant differences between the two groups on  age, grade last completed, race, or sex, (3) Significant differences in family background were found between the enrolled and non-enrolled applicants, (4) Significant differences were apparent between the two groups in intelligence test scores, achievement test scores, grades repeated, personal characteristics, grades obtained, days absent, times tardy, and recommendations from the sending schools. Much of the difference evidenced between the enrolled and non-enrolled students can be traced to the inadequacy of information from the sending school as well as the failure of students to appear for testing and cannot all be attributed to the selection process.

Of those originally interviewed in 1968, 96 out of 100 were reinterviewed in 1969, and analysis of this data revealed that: (1) Black girls were more likely than white girls to drop out of school before completing the twelfth grade, (2) Approximately three in ten young women had revised their educational goals with one in eight raising their goals and one in  six lowering their goals, (3) Approximately one-third of the young women employed at the time of both suveys made at least one interfirm move during the period, (4) job changes were associated with larger increases in hourly wages and with increased job satisfaction, and (5) White young women have substantially more labor market knowledge than black young women.

        "description":"Several simulations of population, income, and employment in rural and urban America during 1970-2000 were made based on alternative assumptions. The assumptions entailed implementation of certain policies that might effect a more equal rural-urban balance by the year 2000, in addition to a continuation of current trends. If basic trends continue, rural outmigration would probably stop or reverse itself shortly after the year 2000, primarily because the gap between the incomes of rural and urban workers would have gradually closed. But the employment-population ratio in rural areas would still be below that in urban areas; hence, overall rural economic growth would still be lower. Policies to increase job opportunities and labor productivity in rural areas were judged to show  more promise as development strategies than were policies to reduce the natural rate of population increase or limit outmigration. For per capita incomes and employment-population ratios in rural and urban America to be equal in the year 2000, about 8.8 million more new jobs than are expected from current trends would be needed in rural areas. Of these, 3.7 million would be transfers of jobs that would have been located in urban areas under present trends; the remaining 5.1 million jobs would have to be created to more fully utilize the underemployed rural labor force.

Approximately 1,500 key business, labor, university, and government leaders met to consider the issues, challenges, and opportunities confronting the American private enterprise system in the coming two decades and the adaptations to change that will be needed. The conference themes were the social responsibility of business, technology and resources for business, the human side of enterprise, the structure of the private enterprise system, and business and the world economy of 1990. One of the addresses included this provocative statement: \"Several clues indicate that the industrialized world may be  experiencing the beginning phase of a sociocultural revolution as profound and pervasive in its effects on all segments of society as the Industrial Revolution, the Reformation, or the Fall of Rome.\" The conference summary stated that business, labor, and educators are able to influence the direction of things to come and to help build an improved system with government and the private economy as partners. Its principal conclusion was that the public, expecially the youth, should be educated to a better understanding of the superiority of our competitive economic system. (MF)",

The interview schedule sought information concerning not only the type and amount of food purchased and the method used to prepare it but also the residential background of the homemakers, the levels of education of both husband and wife, composition of the families, and the ages of the participants. Results indicated that the homemakers who purchased vitamin A and iron rich foods were those who: (1) had a rural background, (2) had a higher level of education, (3) belonged to families where the husband was present and had children under six years of  age, and (4) were over 30 years of age. When the data were analyzed, there was slight evidence of vitamin A and iron loss through preparation techniques.

The program considers the needs of each student, with individualized teaching, self-instructional materials, and other aids. Each student starts at his own level of achievement and moves along at his own rate of speed. Progress is measured against individual performance rather than the class performance. Thus high achievers may move ahead without being hampered while low achievers are not threatened by further failure. In this guide, a  brief history of the pilot and demonstration project is followed by the step-by-step procedures required to establish new programs.

Vocational education is not a separate discipline. Rather, it is an approach to the disciplines and the learning processes which, properly used, could reconstruct the American educational system for greater relevance of general education. Much of today's social unrest is the result of a steady decrease in the availability of jobs for the unskilled and a simultaneous increase in the number of young people who are totally unprepared for skilled employment. The blame belongs to the schools and colleges, for their failure to prepare students for today's world of work. Today's students are career-oriented. A liberal education is not enough. A  redefinition of vocational education is needed to encompass the career theme. An educational program can, at one and the same time and at all levels, prepare students not only for better lives but also for better occupations. The current initial general education, then specialization, is inappropriate. The intertwining of liberal and vocational elements in an educational program should be integrated throughout the entire educational experience. Some Ford Foundation-assisted pilot programs to help achieve this end are described in this paper. (MF)",

In assessing the effectiveness of the programs in reaching and selecting disadvantaged youth, analysis was made of: (1) personal and family characteristics of enrollees plus those who applied for employment but were not accepted, and (2) comparisons of family incomes as reported by the Iowa State Department of Revenue with the family income-family size guidelines for the various programs. The results revealed that a large portion of the enrollees in Project I-TRY programs were disadvantaged as indicated by such characteristics as coming  from households with over six members and from families receiving welfare payments. The enrollees who were not economically disadvantaged according to the family income-family size guidelines were admitted to the programs because of special circumstances, such as personal, discipline, and family problems. Though 1,100 youth experienced employment, the Project I-TRY and other youth employment programs were inadequate in that many young people in these cities were still unemployed.

        "description":"The National Institute of Education (NIE) suggests a plan for national leadership and support of more comprehensive research and development (R. &amp; D.) in the field of career education. The draft plan relies heavily upon suggestions from study teams in the development of a conceptual framework for career education, and in outlining strategies for strengthening programmatic efforts. The initial emphasis for the NIE career education R. &amp; D. program will be the responsiveness of career education to the problems people experience in finding the right jobs and advancing within them. In defining career education as the development of knowledge and of special and general abilities to help individuals and groups interact with the economic sector, NIE emphasizes that both economic and  psychological incomes from employment comprise the long-term outcomes which will be studied. The limited R. &amp; D. resources available will be directed at two target groups most affected by problems of career entry and progression: youth and mid-career adults, particularly women. The four present career education models are examined for current and projected integration into the overall NIE program, and examples are given of suggested projects for research, policy analyses, program development, experimentation, dissemination, evaluation and/or field studies in career education.

        "description":"The concept of adult education for family planning is examined, and a strategy for program development in developing nations is suggested. Experience suggests that learning in groups is generally the most effective means for changing attitudes and behavior, but the skills necessary for participation in learning groups outside family and neighborhood structures are rare in traditional societies. Because of the gap between understanding the need to change and actual behavioral change, educators must create learning experiences and atmosphere in which people will want to learn and change their attitudes and practices in family planning. Subtle methods in programming and communication must be used because of the special problems of family planning education. Learners must perceive  the problem for themselves and feel that they can solve the problem through their own choices. The logical method of developing a program for family planning education is by introducing it into the existing adult education structure. This method has several advantages--local teachers and trainers are accepted and are apt to have influence; linkage with other educational programs is beneficial for family planning education; participants are likely to be young adults receptive to new ideas; and outsiders are more effective when their teaching competence is recognized. World Education supports the idea of creating program development centers within national universities or interagency bodies. (KM)",

The data were classified into two groups: (1) girls who were 4-H club members at the time of the interview, and (2) girls who had been but were not in 4-H in 1970. The purpose was to determine the relation between the 4-H membership status and selected factors concerning personal and family characteristics, interests, and participation in youth organizations and 4-H activities and events. Forty-two variables were identified and used as a basis for comparing 4-H members and dropouts. Contingency tables were used to show the relationships, and chi square statistical analysis was made to show the significance  level of relations identified. Seventeen major findings are reported. These findings showed that 4-H membership status was not significantly related to ages of the girls when data were collected, place of residence, age when first joined 4-H, school grade received most frequently and girls dating patterns. Family characteristics not significantly related to 4-H membership status were: parents marital status; annual family income; fathers' educational levels; fathers' occupations; mothers' employment outside the home, and mothers' attitudes toward 4-H. On the average, a higher percentage of the members than the dropouts felt that each 4-H event and activity should continue to receive about the same emphasis as at the time of the study, and there was a tendency for a higher percentage of  the 4-H members than dropouts to know how to perform each of the 21 selected tasks.

Evaluation data were collected from Extension personnel associated with the program and from local and state Extension personnel in 10 states. General conclusions, which are discussed in detail in the report, were: (1) nutrition education objectives are being met, but greater precision is required; (2) the program promotes improved nutrition related practices; (3) the Extension Service and its use of indigenous aides are appropriate and effective in nutrition education of low-income families; (4) agents are dedicated in the program role, but their  capabilities are increasingly stressed; (5) there is real opportunity for a surge of leadership at higher levels of program management; (6) the program continues to reach the target family population; (7) the link between homemaker and youth efforts should be strengthened; (8) interpretation of objectives and methodological restrictions impede effectiveness of youth activities; (9) reasonable progress has been made in establishing the program within the total community setting; and (10) the need for remedial actions has grown; increasing Extension Service awareness of program weaknesses is a promising sign.

An application of one of the Charnes, Cooper, Niehaus career management models for manpower planning was then made to evaluate the consequences of the policy reducing average GS grade to 9.35 while attempting to meet these forecasted requirements. Estimation of model parameters and evaluation of subsequent output indicated the following: (1) Imposition of the 9.35 average GS grade requirements will seriously affect planned policies relating to NUSC's staffing structure; and (2) A most significant result of this study is that the structure of the Marki Markoff decision model, relating to a population that is smaller than usual,  results in apparent statistical validity. It should provide a useful tool for many manpower studies at NUSC in the future. (Author)",

Findings which support the view that the United States is attaining equilization of health care opportunity include: (1) The gap between the percentage of low and high income people seeing a physician during the year narrowed considerably between 1963 and 1970; (2) Once they see a physician, low income people average more visits than those of higher income; (3) The lowest income people are almost twice as likely to be admitted to a hospital as those with the highest incomes in 1970; and (4) Although non-whites and central city residents have longer lengths of stay once they are admitted to the hospital, their admission rates were still lower than for the  rest of the population in 1970. It is concluded that while great improvements in health care for disadvantaged groups have occurred over the last 10 to 20 years, these groups are silll not equal to the remainder of the population.

The entire range of educational institutions within a country--both school and nonschool--are involved in principle. Primary attention should be directed to the development of programs at the national or subnational level. Some regional and global activities are suggested in support of these programs. It is estimated that between $20 and $25 million will be needed during the next five years for the initiation and institutionalization of school and nonschool programs and supporting regional and global  activities. At the end of the program development phase, estimated at five years, the need for special funds from external donors for population education programs will decline as the programs are integrated into the educational system.

The two types of agencies were compared on 9 sets of variables: manpower, funding, interorganizational linkages, recruitment, hiring practices, community linkages, client population, adequacy of services, and use of paraprofessionals. Results are tabulated and described. The structure and functioning of 23 rehabilitation and 17 social service agencies were then examined to determine the influence such characteristics might have on the agencies' utilization of paraprofessionals. One year later, agency directors were contacted again by mail  questionnaire and telephone. Directors generally viewed paraprofessionals as lacking educational credentials; few were aware of the New Career model emphasizing empathy, \"indigenous\" background, and the ability to learn on the job. Less than half the agencies do not utilize paraprofessionals, but little adherence to the New Careers model was evidenced by those who do employ them. Supervision and control does not encourage these workers to use their special skills. The followup survey indicated little change in the use of paraprofessionals. (KM)",

Researchers have discovered that, although problems of widowhood have attracted little serious inquiry, one of every five women who face conjugal bereavement need outside help to return to a state of physical and mental well-being. New patterns of health care for this ever-increasing number of women include \"widow-to-widow programs\" wherein trained widow aides give direct help to the recently bereaved, voluntary organizations sponsored by religious orders, and widow consultation services provided by private and government agencies. The author feels that further scientific inquiry is needed to identify  those variables associated with high morale and those which correlate with low life satisfaction following bereavement.

More specifically, the document is designed to cast a spotlight upon the preventative and educative services which community mental health centers are pledged to develop. It is also intended to provide center staff and trainees with a concise view of the scope of community mental health consultation and education. Mental health consultation is defined and explored in light of consultation tasks, priorities in the establishment of consultation, authority and power in consultation, the training of consultants, and the recording and evaluation of consultation. The section on mental  health education includes training for professional mental health specialists, mental health education for community service personnel and for the lay public, and training of mental health educators.

Emphasis has been placed on driver and pedestrian safety, since drinking alcohol often begins in junior high school at the same time as students begin to anxiously await getting their driver's permit or license. The manual can be used in a number of ways: teachers and school departments can use the manual to develop their own curriculum outlines; schools, state departments of education, and health agencies can  use the manual to conduct community workshops; the manual can be adapted to treat specific alcohol topics in depth. The collection of over 200 detailed classroom activities for grades seven through nine are designed to achieve a variety of objectives.

The study involved senior midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy. The high group was comprised of those whose cumulative grade point average was between 3.50 and 4.00. The low group was comprised of those whose grade point cumulative average was between 2.00 and 2.25. Instrumentation included a Grass model 79C electroencephalograph, analog/digital filters, digital clocks, digital counters, and an eight channel oscilloscope. Treatment means were evaluated using a repeated measures design and a simple analysis of variance. The following conclusions were reached: (1) There were  differences in brain wave patterns, depending whether the subjects were resting, solving problems, or under stress; and (2) The data did not support the hypothesis that high and low grade point average students would have differing brain wave patterns. Several suggestions are made as to areas for future research, and implications of the study are discussed. (Author/LAA)",

This proposition states that when a person receives feedback about his performance on an intrinsically motivated activity this information will affect his sense of competence and self-determination, thereby affecting his intrinsic motivation. Results of the experiments, performed with undergraduate students, indicate that positive verbal reinforcements decreased intrinsic motivation for females while they increased it for males, and that negative feedback decreased intrinsic motivation presumably by weakening the subject's feelings of competence and self-determination. These data, as well as other related studies, suggest that the  traditional widespread use of external rewards and controls has had unintended, negative consequences on motivation and performance. This implies that we should begin to consider intrinsic motivation more carefully and structure reward and control systems which will be less likely to interfere with intrinsic motivation.

The theoretical basis for the VPI centers around the individual's personality type and its interaction with the environment from which various predictions can be made concerning specific vocational decisions. The report concluded that using a four to six point classification appears to discriminate better between various teaching majors than does the use of a one to three point classification and that the establishment of local VPI classifications by teaching majors appears to be  preferable to relying solely upon Holland's classification.

Since the survival of many schools hinges on their adaptability, they will require procedures for studying ways of responding to change and of evaluating proposals for action. Yet, many pressures bear on the school systems, making reform a slow process. This report analyzes characteristics that make an organization flexible or capable of coping with change and suggests some elements that might be used in fashioning a strategy for dealing with change in schools. While stressing the importance of the school culture as a determinant of school conditions, the report offers suggestions for  strengthening or improving the culture through collective action by teachers and principals and through a conscious plan for dealing with change in the school.

Five subproblems were explored. The underdeveloped boys were compared with junior high athletes for personality differences. A random sample of the undeveloped boys received additional verbal encouragement from the instructor to see if further personality changes were evident. Results indicate that allowing physically underdeveloped boys to participate in an environment using self-based evaluation standards rather than competitively based standards contributed to gains in emotional security and sense of personal worth. The recommendations of the study are that  further research be conducted in the area of self-evaluation uses in more standard academic curricular subjects which may lend themselves to self-evaluation.

It also helps to evaluate the degree of disability impact and to select issues for counseling. The Rehabilitation Gain Scale measures the vocational and extravocational impact of rehabilitation services on clients; administering the scale as acceptance provides a diagnostic measure of rehabilitation potential and case feasibility. The Rehabilitation Need and  Status Scale measures a client's rehabilitation-related functioning before, during or after services and helps assess his unmet needs and how to satisfy them. The authors feel that advance knowledge of difficult cases should help practitioners and administrators program for these clients and provide them with more effective services.

The present investigation examined both white and black subjects' non-verbal behavior and also independently varied the race of the person with whom the subject interacted. The experimental setting was an actual employment interview. Twenty black and twenty white female undergraduates were individually interviewed by either a black or white male interviewer. White subjects tended to maintain more visual interaction with interviewers of both races than did black subjects. Moreover, black interviewers were visually interacted with less, and given shorter glances. Racial, in contrast to nonracial, questions elicited longer glances and subjects hesitated longer before answering them.  Mehrabian's (1967) \"immediacy\" concept is used to interpret the results.

Performance on the task was to provide the following information: (1) initial ability level of subjects; (2) the ability of groups of differing size and leadership to utilize their resources; and, (3) the ability of individuals to acquire correct responses, as a function of their experience on the group task. Performance was predicted using Steiner's (1966, 1972) model of group productivity. Group performance on the task was a position function of group size for the sizes studied. Subsequent individual performance was difficult to interpret: Performance increased with group size for subjects who had been of size 5, and again  increased for Ss who had worked in groups of 7. This duplicated the data of a pilot study. Patterns of process adaptation in groups of \"critical\" size are discussed as possibly responsible for this pattern. It was concluded that groups can facilitate the individual acquisition of knowledge. An application of this information, the small group examination, was discussed. (Author)",

They were asked if they would inform in response to an adult who asks for the names of those involved. Summarizing 22 surveys revealed that within cultures the disposition to inform was stronger in rural than in urban children and in girls than boys. Analysis of two surveys in Israel and West Germany showed: (1) informing generally more likely when demanded by school authorities after school-related mischief than when demanded by an unspecified adult who was the victim of the mischief; (2) German children more disposed to inform than the  Israelis (although both samples were very unlikely to inform and were the two least likely of the 12 countries studied); (3) the relation of informing to family authority structure was similar for the same sex across culture, especially for girls, but unrelated across sex within culture; and (4) combining cultures, informing in boys was more likely for those who described their family as intermediate in the degree of parental decision-making differentiation than for those from either undifferentiated or highly differentiated families, but was unrelated to whether father or mother made most of the decisions.

He considered denial, e.g., in his papers on Repression (1915) and on Fetishism (1927) in Collected Papers, Volumes IV and V respectively (London: Hogarth and The Institute of Psycho-Analysis, 1925 and 1950 respectively). It would be best to read the paper on Fetishism, first. However, there seems to be difficulty in the psychoanalytic, psychological, and psychiatric literature with regard to the concept. One problem is the differentiation of denial within and between the archaic-heritage and the personal-experience of the neonate. Another problem is the overlap with the mechanism of repression. Still another problem is the use of denial by psychotics, who are  more difficult to understand, to work with, etc. The added questions of conceptual clarity augment the problems of doing research. Denial, by name, has had little research compared to repression. In this bibliography, there is included research on denial between the late 1920's and the middle 1960's. (Author)",

Results obtained from the 56 subjects placed in the experimental conditions indicate that in the absence of prior commitment to the victim, only 20% of the subjects were responsive; under conditions of commitment, the result was clearly reversed and 95% of the subjects were responsive and intervened in the theft.

Subjects included boys (half of whom were black) who were from two integrated schools and who knew less than half of the letters of the alphabet. Different teaching strategies were used to teach the alphabet--a modified Bereiter technique, spending four to six minutes with each individual, rotating teachers, and the use of personal student notebooks. Subjects were given two tests: the Matching Familiar Figures Test (MFF) to identify subjects with varying conceptual tempos and the Ambiguous Figure Test to look at the  ability of the subjects to communicate with one another. Results indicated that the experimental subjects learned more letters than the control group and that black subjects did significantly better than white subjects. No significant correlations were found on the MFF, indicating that it might have been inappropriate for the subjects. The most interesting discovery was the fact that there was a large variation in the knowledge of the alphabet without teacher awareness and that many of the middle-class children knew the alphabet.

Copies of the passages are reproduced in the text, and the comprehension exercises are given in the appendix. For each group evaluated, the results are given by region, sex, race, parental education, and size and type of community. Readers are cautioned to avoid comparing reading rates or comprehension scores across age groups because all groups did not  read passages of the same type, nor is there an even progression of difficulty in the readability of the passages.

The results of the first experiment indicated that not attempting to recall items did not affect appreciably the later recall of these items.

In the fifth, sixth, and seventh experiments, items were presented individually. They were then followed by a blank interval of time that could vary, and then the item's instruction appeared. It was found that final recognition for remember and forget items was positively related to the length of the interval, while final recall was not. In the eighth experiment it was found that implicit forget  items were more likely than explicit forget items to be intruded in immediate recall, to be recalled during final recall, and to be recognized in a final recognition test.

A further discussion of strengths of i.t.a. programs as compared with typical similar traditional orthography (T.O.) programs demonstrates that T.O. constrains; such factors as reactive inhibition and feature characteristics of symbols are realities not accounted for in T.O. programs rather than any weakness in the author's capabilities. Rejection of the notion that traditional orthography is optimal for reading-writing purposes  is supported. (Author/TO)",

        "description":"Two studies investigating auditory information processing abilities of children are reported in this document. The first study analyzed the preferred specific acoustical dimension in an auditory discrimination task of preschool and sixth grade children from low and middle socioeconomic groups. Results indicated that children at both age levels do exhibit an auditory dimensional preference in a three-choice pure-tone discrimination task but that neither socioeconomic status nor age has a significant effect on dimensional preference. The second study investigated the relationship between pure-tone discrimination, as well as auditory dimensional preferences in discrimination, and linguistic discrimination across a narrow age range. Twenty-four preschool children, twelve four year  olds and twelve five year olds, served as subjects. The results indicate that while auditory discrimination performance did not significantly improve with age, linguistic discrimination performance did. Together the results of these studies suggest that while auditory processing abilities do not differ between samples, linguistic discrimination performance may vary due to the increased number of structural units accessible to each memory component for the analysis-by-synthesis process.

Within each unit one child was randomly selected from a high IQ group, one from an average IQ group, and one from a low IQ group. The IQ scores were obtained from the school records and were the subjects' most recent scores on the Lorge-Thorndike Intelligence Test. Clerical aides were trained to observe the  subjects during skill instruction in reading whenever it was taking place. The aides made one observation a day for ten weeks.

Eighty eighth grade students ranging in age from 13 years 3 months to 14 years 10 months were selected as subjects. Three different digit span tests were used to measure Level I ability, involving series of from three to nine digits presented aurally via tape recorder. Paired associate materials were also presented aurally and consisted of six high-image pairs, six low-image pairs, and six moderate-image pairs selected from the 40 highest, 40 lowest, and 40 most moderately rated imagery categories according to the Paivio, Yille, and Madigan norms. IQ scores  obtained from school records served as a measure of Level II ability. Imagery conditions constituted a highly significant source of variance. A predicted Learning Levels X Imagery Conditions interaction was not obtained, nor did the Level II group significantly outperform the Level I group. Strategy scores derived from the subjects' reports correlated significantly with paired-associate learning only for Level I subjects. Level II subjects reported greater use of verbal and imaginal elaboration. (WR)",

Six sections of students enrolled in three vocational courses taught by seven instructors served as the study population. The reading comprehension levels of the students were determined by the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test, Comprehension Subtest. The readability of each textbook used was determined by applying a  computerized version of the Dale-Chall Formula. A 219-item survey was used to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes of the instructors with respect to reading and text use. Analysis of student scores, text readability levels, and instructor surveys prompted the instructional personnel involved to modify their course offerings to better fit their students' needs. Due to the benefits gained by faculty and students from the study, the program has been adopted for general use at the College of DuPage. (TO)",

Eighty college students were administered a series of aptitude tests and randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. The subjects then received six passages, each passage followed by a question. The type of question was dependent upon treatment. Following the presentation of the stimulus materials in treatments, subjects were given recognition and recall tasks. The recognition task consisted of 24 multiple choice questions. The recall task instructed subjects to write down as many inferences as they could remember from each passage. The same tasks were used 24 to 48 hours later to obtain measures of delayed recall and  recognition. The prime dependent measures were recognition of inferences and total recall of productive inferences. The recall measure was further broken down to recall of superordinate inferences, coordinate inferences, and associative inferences. Among the conclusions drawn were the following: (1) individual differences in inferential behavior do occur in text processing, (2) some of these differences are predictable using prior measures of relevant aptitudes, and (3) certain treatments do interact with certain aptitudes.

        "description":"The behaviors manifested by mothers of readers and mothers of nonreaders were observed as they taught their children two cognitive tasks. As a methodological control, both groups of mothers were required to teach two other children, one similar to and one different in ability from their own child. The subjects consisted of 40 first grade children, their mothers, and 80 additional first graders. Twenty of the mothers had children classified as problem readers and 20 had children classified as successful readers. Of the remaining first grade children, 40 were children with reading difficulties and 40 were successful readers. Each problem reader was matched with a successful reader for IQ, age, and sex. A mother initially taught her child two cognitive tasks; she then taught the  same cognitive tasks to a child of the same reading ability as her own child and to a child with a different reading ability from that of her own child. The tasks consisted of teaching the child to match 12 pairs of line-drawn faces and to fit pegs of different lengths into holes of varying depths in such a manner that all the pegs were level across the top. The most significant findings was the intrusive, controlling, and negatively reinforcing teaching strategy of the mothers of nonreaders. (WR)",

        "description":"This paper, presented at the eighteenth annual convention of the International Reading Association, identifies the problems that reading may create in teaching social studies from kindergarten through grade twelve. Three alternatives are suggested for use when reading becomes difficult: (1) change the reading level of the material, (2) change the method of teaching, or (3) change the teacher in the classroom. Comparisons are made among these alternatives for the primary and intermediate grade levels as well as for the junior and senior high school levels. Research shows that some popular ideas, such as changing the readability level, may not have much effect on student comprehension. The main point, in the author's opinion, is to make people aware of the fact that reading plays a  very important, and often drastic, role in the teaching of social studies, but there are ways to get around the problems that reading may create.

The subjects were 152 eighth grade students, 113 of whom were in the traditional reading program, and 39 of whom were in the individualized program. The findings indicated that the children in the individualized groups read an average of 6.3 books during the period studied. Subjects in the traditional reading program read an average of 4.1 books. Boys in the individualized  reading group read the most, followed by girls in that group; girls in the traditional group ranked third, and boys in the traditional group read the least.

        "description":"In an attempt to demonstrate that the mismatch between the grammatical features of Black dialect and Standard English grammar used in children's reading materials is a source of reading interference, 67 second and third grade Black dialect speaking children each read orally a text written in Black dialect and a parallel text written in Standard English. Subjects also retold the contents of the texts and answered multiple-choice comprehension questions. The analysis of oral reading miscues and the measures of comprehension formed the dependent variables for the study. It was hypothesized that the dialect text, because it reduced the mismatch between the children's language and the printed language, would produce greater comprehension, more effective use of contextual and  graphophonic information and fewer dialect-related miscues than the Standard English text. The results of the analysis, however, failed to support the prediction of the reading interference hypothesis, as no differences were found between the dialect and standard texts on comprehension, use of contextual information, and use of graphophonic information. On dialect related miscues, the results were in the opposite direction of that predicted by the hypothesis. (Author/MF)",

        "description":"This study investigated some characteristics of intonation patterns in the English spoken by black adolescents in Seattle, Washington. It was hypothesized that if intonation is central to communicating attitude, and if Black English intonation differs systematically from that of Standard English, communication between blacks and whites may be difficult. The study used tape recordings of black adolescents in an excited, informal discussion, white adolescents (WE) in an informal discussion, and a formal interview with an adult black male (FBE). The following intonation features were found characteristic of Black English: (1) a wider pitch range, extending into higher pitch levels than in WE or FBE, and often shifting into a falsetto register; (2) more level and rising final pitch  contours; (3) apparent greater use of falling final contours with general (yes/no) questions in formal and perhaps threatening situations; and (4) the use of nonfinal intonation contours alone (without the use of the word \"if\") to mark the dependent clause of a conditional sentence. The study concluded that the importance of intonation in communicating attitude has been greatly underestimated. (Author/DI)",

        "description":"The uncertainties and issues in our society are not peripheral to but intrinsically a part of English, the author of this paper argues, and more alternatives in English are required to accommodate the diversity of life styles and value systems among students. If the English curriculum cannot grapple with these forces, then it deserves to be absorbed by other components of the curriculum. The most significant change in the subject-matter which will help insure the survival of English is the focus upon the learner in the learning process. The role of the teacher should become that of facilitating the learning process as a resource person rather than as a dispenser of facts. The focus of language instruction should rest with what the child can do with language since it exists within  the student's power to create, rather than with following the textbook mechanically, chapter by chapter. Options must be broadened to include oral language and film experiences, open classrooms, and a sincere humanization of pedagogical approaches. Caution needs to be exercised so these innovations don't become the means for teachers to keep at \"legitimate\" distances from students. The needs and concerns of the students must be considered, and teachers must try to be human beings first and teachers second. (HS)",

Sources of problems lay in (1) the absence of an explicit theory of language underlying the study or series of propositions; (2) the failure to get beyond gross descriptions of complex matters, including behaviors, or, if the studies were focused narrowly, their generalizations were considerably out of proportion to what actually was done as a piece of work; (3) the lack of comparability among studies which had other characteristics in common; and (4) the nature and extent of the criteria as well as their relation to a few studies which did attempt to outline, manipulate, and then  evaluate specific behaviors. Recommendations included a shift of subsequent attention to search areas which would yield more appropriate descriptive examples. Mentioned as especially promising was the relevance of the situational context of teacher behavior in relation to children's oral language and speaking with recent sociolinguistic research as a pertinent source for this search area.

Much time and effort is wasted by marking students' papers with comments such as \"specify,\"\"details,\"\"illustrate,\" or \"demonstrate.\" Significant concrete details should occur to a writer before the generalization does, since the best kind of details that support an idea or suggest a feeling inhere in it from its beginning. An analysis of the mental operations which occur in the writing of details reveals that the student who is most proficient at this aspect of writing is able to put himself in the place of other readers even as he writes. To enable students to acquire this ability, teachers should assign students dramatic situations from which to write, spend time on  pre-writing, and attempt to make students aware both of the tendency of the mature mind to generalize and of the difficulty of reversing generalizations to go back to the facts that led to them.

The writer, who has taught some of these courses, argues that there is a definite place for environmental studies in the humanities curriculum. One course, entitled \"Wilderness as a Way of Life,\" not only included readings but also asked the student to do some wildnerness living and to submit projects related to these experiences. A course in survival required reading in and experience of survival techniques. The author describes some of the books the student read in this course and some of the projects they created. An appendix includes the course outline for \"Wilderness as a Way of Life,\" a discussion of some  suggested projects for the course, and a list of books, films, and multimedia presentations relevant to the course.

The author, a high school English teacher, found that his students wrote poorly because they were writing on topics of which they had no intimate knowledge and because the theme assignments pleased the teacher, not the students. In an effort to overcome these shortcomings, the author asked his students to write for twelve minutes of each day on any topic from their own experience. After collecting the themes, the teacher scanned each for thirty seconds, underlining a memorable word, phrase, or line, but not making any written comments. At the end of the week each student rewrote one of his themes and ditto mastered it. The teacher did not distribute themes  whose content might embarrass the student (these were discussed in private conference), but many of the other themes were discussed in class. No names were attached nor grades assigned until the end of the quarter. The writer argues that this method, which concentrated on the student's personal experience, resulted in much more successful writing. (DI)",

At present, the author points out, only seven states require such training for secondary school certification. The author regrets that relatively few English teachers have had reading education, since quite a few of them are asked to teach reading. It is suggested that teachers elect to train themselves in reading or to enroll in reading courses and that they design reading lessons for their students and use English curriculum content as the basis of these lessons. Two texts are recommended for self-preparation, \"The Psychology and Pedagogy of Reading (Huey, 1918) and \"Understanding Reading\" (Smith, 1971). The author also  suggests strategies for developing lessons in reading for the English class and recommends some books which can provide assistance in that development. (Author/DI)",

Thus, response to narrative techniques--setting and exposition, dramatic moments, characterization, point of view, pattern and design, and words and language--is the special focus of the study. After reading two of the six short stories selected, 165 students from advanced high school English classes completed a multiple-choice comprehension test which was developed for each story and which identified and eliminated students who had read the story carelessly or with little understanding. Then, to provide information about response to particular aspects of the stories, each  student selected from an inventory of eighteen comments those most like his own responses. The analysis of responses to one short story are presented. Through the method developed for this study, insight was gained into student response to particular stories. Also, this study leads to new possibilities for describing those responses and for facilitating deeper and more articulate reactions to particular literary works.

The author suggests that students choose a novel that is short, interesting, and not too difficult; that they reach a consensus among themselves as to the theme of the novel; and that they express their interpretation through nonprint media. (Print must not be used.) The teacher is primarily a facilitator, one who has more questions than suggestions. The author, who has used this multi-media response process in his classes for four years, finds that the experience has increased his students' appreciation of literature and that it has also encouraged these prospective junior high school teachers to teach literature for the students' sake, not the teacher's. The author concludes  that it is essential for students to become active, intelligent, and discriminating consumers of both print and nonprint media. He feels that this educational goal is best reached when the students, not the teachers, are the ones who use the equipment, plan the presentations, and discuss and evaluate interpretations of these media.

Ghetto children are also expected to add other registers, that is, &quot;standard&quot; features, to their linguistic repertoires after they enter school. The language spoken in school, the language of instruction register (LIR), often conflicts with the linguistic components of the black child's vernacular registers. After having studied the responses of black vernacular speaking children in grades 1, 3, and 5, it was found that the older the child, the more LIR features he  produced--by grade 5, 71% of all responses were made in the LIR. Only word final consonant clusters (-sks and -sts) demonstrated very low levels of acquisition--4% by grade 5.

One proposed means of accomplishing this goal has been classroom dramatics, especially involving the simulation of real-life language situations. To test this approach for improving the English skills of Mexican-American students, a small scale experiment was conducted for ten weeks using creative dramatics with 58 second, sixth, and seventh grade students. Improvement in language skills in the experimental groups was evaluated in comparison  with that of similar students in control groups. Videotape was extensively used in teaching, documenting the project activities, and assessing the results. The outcome, though not conclusive, suggests that creative dramatics promotes more effective use of English and may be adapted to conventional classrooms. (Author/DI)",

Results indicate that the module would be appropriate for high school students of average and above average ability levels or for college students who have not had a course in transformational grammar.

Six items deal with noun  clauses-inifinitive-gerund phrase options.

Respondents were children, teenagers, and young adults (ages 26-35) who wrote exercises related to the objectives of (1) writing to communicate adequately in a social situation, (2) writing to communicate adequately in a business or vocational situation, (3) writing to communicate adequately in a scholastic situation, and (4) appreciating the value of writing. The survey is divided into four chapters, each of which reports detailed results of the exercises related to the four objectives. Results are discussed and reported in graph and chart form and are presented for an age group as a whole and for groups representing (1)  different regions of the country, (2) both sexes, (3) different races, (4) different sizes and types of communities, and (5) for persons having different parental education.

School texts and dictionaries perpetuate this sexism and continue to keep women in a passive role against the natural cultural and evolutional process of liberation presently occurring. In order to change attitudes, sexists claim language must also change. Already words such as sexism, chauvinism, chairperson, and Ms. have crept into the language and some now appear in dictionaries and official correspondences.

Furthermore, we need to neutralize any prejudiced concepts which the student may have previously assimilated. Teachers should enable students to recognize for themselves instances of sex bias in their previous education and to guard against the acceptance of such ready-made attitudes and distortions in their college experience. Teachers could begin a discussion of sex bias in culture with questions surveying the student's previous experience which could follow with discussions allowing students to compare views on the  roles of men and women in our society. Through an exploration of literature, folk humor, television programming, advertisements, and other forms of media, students can focus upon the prejudice implied and the sexual stereotypes which are thus perpetuated. In this way the student can recognize occasional bias in otherwise sound literary criticism or other forms of communication. (HOD)",

A review of the research revealed that all three methods had been used but that no evidence existed for postulating the superiority of any one method. Subjects were divided into three groups, each exposed to a different method. Findings indicated significant differences existed among the three treatments although none existed between the Interview and the Picture Stimulus Interview. Furthermore, the  research showed the Free Play Situation to be the weakest sampling technique. Consequently the following conclusions were drawn: (1) the recording of an interview is a better method than the recording of a free play situation for gaining a sample of children's language; (2) the inclusion or exclusion of picture stimuli will not make a difference in the subjects' speech; and (3) measuring the total number of words spoken by a subject in an interview will yield a good indication of that subject's performance on syntactic structures.

Most small group measuring instruments have been built around a task-leader or socio-emotional leader dichotomy. Lack of consistent direct relationship between the influence of individual members of the group and their position in the group suggests that an understanding of group leadership and power cannot be gained solely from a functional approach in a social influence perspective. The propositions and hypotheses of this paper are concerned with the general power a leader in a group holds over the membership throughout the group's life span.  Proana 5 computer simulation was used to demonstrate the theoretical considerations of this paper in terms of small group interaction, providing a possible description of the interaction of on-going groups.

Specifically, findings regarding audience response to persuasive antidrug abuse messages on television are discussed. On the basis of the obtained data the authors conclude that the media and message strategies currently employed in the United States in dealing with the drug abuse problem are simply not in accord with available research evidence. Media scheduling of drug abuse public service announcements appears to be done at random without evident concern for reaching intended audiences or generating maximum effect. Certain of the strategies commonly employed appear to  produce reactions in seeming contradiction to stated message goals. The authors suggest that a rigorously planned set of information dissemination activities, in which both message and channel selection is geared to particular audience segments, is needed.

The perceptual process of attribution can provide the necessary perspective from which to integrate these findings and stimulate new research. The role of attribution theory in the attitude-behavior relationship seems to be a crucial one. The attributions a person makes determine whether or not his attitudes are related to his behavior in any situation. The individual's perceptual point of view, the attributions that he associates with a behavior based on the appropriate attitudes, beliefs, social norms, and personal motives, affects how he organizes the information and data in his environment to make it understandable. Especially in the  prediction of behavior, one must relate the cognitive system of a person to his behaviors. (LG)",

The role of intrapersonal communication--the mourner communicating with himself--and interpersonal communication--the mourner communicating with others on an informal level--and the therapeutic value of communication concepts for dealing with grief are examined. The rapidly developing study of thanatology--the science of dying--and the emergence of grief therapy groups, in which those who have experienced grief meet with newly bereaved persons, are interpreted as testaments to the importance of communication as the prime variable in this situation.  Communication provides a therapeutic catharsis for the mourner and, application of communication concepts in the verbalization of grief can provide a set of labels and information which help the grieved person deal with his problems. Effective intra- and interpersonal communication can ease the pain experienced by the mourners. (LG)",

Various other activities were also required of the subjects. Considering earlier conclusions and the implications which ensued, the results of this study were disappointing. There were no  differences in the amount of resistance to immediate counterpropaganda conferred by counterattitudinal advocacy and passive message reception.

Mass media advertising is the primary vehicle through which the capitalist culture indoctrinates the ideas of competition for the intangibles (love, freindship, etc.) as well as the tangible things of the culture. Thus intangibles become commodities. The counter-culture (flower children, purposive dropouts, etc.), community action groups (school liberation, free medical clinics, etc.), and women's liberation offer promise of improvement and rejection of society's consumer-oriented value system.

Development of the organization is described in the context of Rosenwasser's classification system of rhetorical analysis. The goals, tactics, and strategies of the Caucus are also discussed. An evaluation of internal (member-directed) communication reveals three purposes: reinforcement of the basic beliefs and goals of the Caucus and the movement of which it is a part, dissemination of information, and exhortation to action and unity. Purposes of external communication are to obtain media attention, to influence power agents, and to proselytize (to convert through consciousness raising). This analysis emphasizes that women  acting in concert from the basis of strong political organization can have the power to shape any society or nation. (EE)",

The need for orientation leads to media use, which in turn leads to agenda-setting. Surveys conducted in North Carolina in the spring of 1972 led to the conclusion that there are strong positive relationships between the level of need for orientation and both the amount of use of mass communication and the degree of susceptibility to  its agenda-setting effect.

Attention is given to manifest differences between laboratory training groups and problem-solving discussion groups. The thrust of the analysis focuses upon the cognitive and experiential differences between these types of groups. Examples of contrasting types and  uses of feedback, predictable trends in developmental sequences, the effects of untrained leaders, and potential stress on individual members tend to support the contention that laboratory group activities may not provide an appropriate model for improving problem-solving skills.

Theorists have posed a sharp distinction between verbal and nonverbal behaviors, although the function of both forms, the communication of information, is the same. Human communication is mediated by many channels and encoded in a variety of ways by individuals who utilize different amounts of intention, awareness, and feedback. The more descriptive communication model postualted is based on three dimensions: channel, code, and  propositionality. Channels contain four separate media: voice, body, objects, and environmental physical features. The three types of both digital and analogic coding are intrinsic, iconic intrinsic, and arbitrary extrinsic. The third dimension is determined by the interaction of intent, awareness, and feedback.

During a specified time period, 726 children in a school district in London, England, were interviewed by means of a self-administered questionnaire. In the nine schools tested, equivalent numbers of classes of 9-, 12-, and 15-year-old children were systematically selected to yield a representative pooling of respondents. The analysis of the  questionnaire revealed that the major reasons children watch television are: for arousal, for companionship, to relax, to forget, as a habit, to learn, and to pass time. A useful means of identifying a finite and similar set of motivations for going to television among a wide range of young people is presented. (EE)",

In addition, the study tested two secondary hypotheses regarding the effects of mispronunciation on the persuasive impact of the message. Following the initial pretest, subjects at two levels of educational background rated the credibility of a speaker who argued for inefficiency in government. There were four versions of the persuasive message, with the number of mispronunications varying in each version.  After hearing the speech, all subjects completed the posttest.

Some tentative generalizations regarding American ombudsman offices contend that (1) ombudsman models vary in the degree to which they are capable of resolving individual grievances, forestalling recurrent complaints, and exonerating public officials of unfounded criticism; (2) executive ombudsmen are more dependent on the commitment of the chief executive to complaint  handling and weaker in their ability to exonerate administrative personnel in the absence of complementary (independent) grievance mechanisms, such as newspaper action-lines; (3) ombudsman offices are significantly dependent on the legislative body that appropriates their funds and on auxiliary grievance mechanisms; (4) the first American model is more inclined to reach informal agreements leading to &quot;voluntary rectifications&quot; than are its counterparts in other countries; and (5) initial success appears to generate additional complaints from those who earlier saw no reason to register their grievances.

An attitude scale composed of 70 items was administered to a sample of 64 program assistants in the Tucson Early Education Model (TEEM). The data were analyzed through correlational procedures and indicate the high similarity between open education and progressive education, differing only in the respect that open education is less traditional. Among the implications of these data would be the importance of considering the frustrations and problems encountered by the proponents of progressive education. (Author/MLF)",

Needs assessment, a critical element in this model, consists of objectively identifying the educational needs of clients and establishing an initial list of priorities. The statement of these needs in terms of behavioral or performance objectives constitutes the heart of the entire model. Phases included in the model can be classified as primarily concerned with planning and implementation. Tasks in the planning phase include stating divisional objectives, stating the performance objectives of all programs, selecting activities to achieve the stated objectives, developing a program evaluation plan,  and completing the program evaluation guide. The completion of this phase results in the translation of targeted needs into viable programs to meet those needs. The implementation phase comprises actually performing the activities designed to permit accomplishment of the stated objectives. The program itself is subject to an ongoing evaluation whose major purpose is to improve managerial decisions by permitting the directors to manipulate their resources and activities to achieve the optimum output in terms of objectives attainment.

The authors have, therefore, attempted to reconceptualize the issue, describing, in particular, the doctoral program for the training of educational administrators at the University of California at Riverside. A socialization framework is presented contending that values, norms, and required behavior patterns are acquired through processes. The process advocated is based on an analysis of occupational identification. According to the authors, the training of educational  administrators should, therefore, take place in the context that would be most likely to produce the acquisition of academic and field values. Such a context would require the concurrent utilization of field (the school district) and university resources. (Author)",

Demand processing is the conversion to outputs of the demands, needs, desires, or inputs presented to the school board. Use of the technique in a school district in each of two States showed that most input demands of a school district begin with the State educational agencies and seem guided by an apparent State objective to provide and maintain public education. In California, the State dominated demands in two areas -- school finance and school facilities; while, in New York, there did not appear to be an equal press in these areas. It was also true, however, that federal agencies accounted for most demands in another  finance area of federal aid, but the demands were proportionally few and most were routine. Greater differences were found between the districts in curriculum, personnel, and issues of general concern. (Author)",

The author feels that the critical problem seems to be whether the small district actually makes a deliberate decision not to participate in federal programs or whether it is systematically excluded because of its size. The study, therefore, tested whether district size was related to federal aid participation, and whether total wealth (based on total assessed valuation) was related to federal aid applications. Additionally, a measure based on assessed valuation per pupil was used to combine both size and wealth reveal any hidden relations that total wealth by itself might obscure. Results indicate that  district size is a significant predictor of federal aid response, but that neither total assessed valuation nor assessed valuation per pupil show any relation to federal aid responses.

The operation model views teachers as the key variable in the introduction of planned change. Their commitment to change, it is claimed, comes about when teachers are given responsibility for making decisions about the change in areas where their professional expertise is dominant. Some findings of the project to date indicate that the rate of adoption of the innovation is slower than was originally planned, that the task of communicating the intent of the project to teachers has been underestimated, and that substantially more investment  will be needed in directly training teachers to use the innovation effectively.

Both schools were built during 1969-70 in the same geographical area along the southeast coast of Florida and are also served by the same electric utility company. They have been exposed to the same seasonal weather changes, building conditions, and economic impact. Since these schools are also similar in educational requirements and architectural planning, although completely dissimilar in air-conditioning or mechanical design concepts, a basis was established for a realistic, meaningful, and valid comparison. To carry out the study (1) energy consumption of equipment was metered, (2)  replacement costs because of differences in longevity of equipment were adjusted, (3) first costs because of differences in design and owner requirements were adjusted, (4) \"money costs\" based on available funding options over an extended period of time were considered, and (5) maintenance costs were applied to operating costs. Study results show that it is more economical to own and operate the roof-mounted, multizoned, unitary type air-conditioning system than to own and operate the central, chilled water, terminal heat/reheat, type.

Rapidly increasing enrollments coupled with changes in both curriculum and in teaching methods created a demand for more flexible facilities that could be constructed rapidly and inexpensively. The success of systems procedures in dealing with the problems of time, cost, quality, and flexibility at the elementary and secondary school levels lead quite naturally to the extension of this approach to higher education. The four projects described in this issue are representative of the use of systems procedures to solve a variety of planning and design problems on community college, college, and university campuses.

        "description":"This newsletter details the efforts of the University of Alaska to develop a systems approach that will provide facilities for higher education in a State with an area more than three and one half times that of New Jersey, Florida, and Oregon combined. The problem involved in providing appropriate facilities in a State such as Alaska are compounded by (1) climate, (2) distance, (3) labor and contractor shortages, and (4) inflation. Fast track scheduling, building systems technology, and management contracting, three innovative design and construction procedures, were devised by the University and its consultants to combat the effects of these factors and were applied to shorten construction time for the six University projects. The first part of this 2-part series on systems on  the campus appears as EA 004 974. (Author/MLF)",

Where there is a working participative management there is a strong orientation towards goals, ample rewards for achieving goals, a uniting of people moving towards these goals, and a high level of leader enthusiasm. Participative management provides everyone with some input avenues to management decisions. A school can be administered through participatory management, particularly if the superintendent and the board understand what it really means in  terms of their commitment and the resources of the district; they agree on the concept and its implementation; the superintendent's perceptions and understandings of the school system and our society are comprehensive; and a communications network exists to assure the superintendent of continual progress reports on all phases of the operation.

This means that the individual is less and less able to deal with reality through preprogrammed decisions, and is forced into more creative decisionmaking. If we do not learn to understand and guide the great forces of change at work in our world today, we may find ourselves, like the Shafter cow, swallowed up by vast upheavals in our way of life.

Yet, responses to a recent poll of 50 large cities indicate that most school districts still depend on the traditional training by universities for administration. Of the 34 cities that replied, only one school district indicated signs of an ongoing program for administrative trainees. The development of an inservice training program for administrators should begin with the assumption that it is essential to direct administrators into new channels of endeavor through training and retraining of personnel. Retraining should be mandatory for all administrators in the field, and training for potential candidates in administration should be provided on a selective basis. Any program should include such  issues as management by objectives, attitudes of teachers and administrators, paraprofessional training, developing performance objectives, school-community planning, and the use of technology.

Based on field observations and on the contention that (in an era of increasing collective behavior on the part of teachers) hostility might take the form of increased teacher militancy, five hypotheses were developed and tested in their null form. Results on two of the hypotheses indicate no relationship between teacher militancy and either representative- or punishment-centered rule administration. Results on two other hypotheses leave little doubt, however, that when elementary principals are perceived by teachers as being representative-centered in their rule administration, they are also  perceived as having high leadership; and likewise that when they are perceived as being punishment-centered they are also perceived as having low leadership behavior. Results on the fifth hypothesis confirm that teacher militancy declines as the perceived leadership of the principal increases. (Author)",

This summary compiles survey data on 18,000 occurrences of damage or loss to buildings, glass, equipment, buses, and nonspecified areas amounting to $4,500,000 dollars. The total loss recovery by all techniques utilized in the 23 reporting districts amounted to $432,000, with an average recovery percentage of nine percent. Reported onsite anti-vandalism techniques include the use of fencing, floodlighting, lexan/plexiglass windows, protective screening, burglar alarm systems, security  patrols, and guard dogs. Survey results also reflect administrative measures taken, such as community action committees, neighborhood school alert systems, publicity campaigns, telephone &quot;hot lines,&quot; police cooperation, and court cooperation. However, from the evidence reported, it appears that no effective means of preventing burglary and vandalism occurrences has been developed, and several suggestions are made for improving preventative measures.

Academics, school district superintendents, legislators, parents' groups, and teachers have all expressed the view that increased State aid to education inevitably will bring Statewide regulations and reduce local control. This preliminary study suggests that there is no relationship between the degree of State control and the proportion of State aid. In ten States with different levels of State aid, 11 dimensions of State control over local school board decisionmaking are examined, including curricular requirements; budgetary and taxing restrictions; State regulation of federal programs; regulations affecting personnel; and  regulations concerning district formation, annexation, and consolidation. The study also includes a less detailed analysis of the relationship among the rate at which innovative educational practices were adopted in a State, the degree of State controls, and the level of State aid. Tentative findings indicate little correlation between the degree of State control and the rate at which innovations are adopted, but a positive relationship between the assumption by the State of a larger share of total nonfederal education support and a high rate of innovation.

He suggests that existing categorical aid programs be condensed into nine instructional and three student services programs, with a program cost formula for each of the twelve programs to be developed. These formulas could be as objective as possible to assure that all local school systems would receive equal treatment, yet be sensitive to unusual local conditions that affect the amount of funds needed.

The third step involved the development and passage of the Toledo Safe Passage To School Law which fines or jails those convicted of assault (either physical or verbal) on a student or any other person going to or from school or on school grounds.

The other phase would be directed toward releasing test scores in relationship to salient characterists of the school system (teacher-pupil ratios, staff turnover statistics,etc.) that affect the learning of its clientele.

He presents performance-based curriculum as a decentralized information system designed to provide instructional data to interested parties; one that employs the concept &quot;teacher-free&quot; (free of significant individual teacher bias and interpretation) and is characterized by its specificity of competencies to be mastered -- success evidence, facilitative conditions, and student-centered focus. The development of such a system, the author contends, involves a lengthy piecemeal, step-by-step procedure; the  ultimate objective being a fundamental, &quot;single flow&quot; information system concentrating on the teaching-learning process and product. In such a system, communication requirements should be pinpointed, methods for treating the data incorporated, and data feedback facilitated. Implementation of the system on a large scale is best facilitated through the employment of electronic data processing. Involvement of teachers and first level administrators in the fundamental decisions required in the planning, development, and operation of the system for the performance-based curriculum is indicated as essential to the success of the program.

        "description":"This paper proceeds from the assumption that (1) thinking about values is necessary and critical for people interested in curriculum; (2) curriculum designs are value-oriented statements; (3) in approaching curriculum thinking from an interest in values, it is important to identify clearly the unit of interest and its relationship to other units of interest; (4) the focus and use of values thinking will be different from one unit of interest to another; and (5) that attempts at a productive dialogue, when primary interests are in different units, lead to hostility and confusion rather than to understanding and clarity. From these assumptions, the author draws four implications: (1) it is important to clearly identify ones unit of interest before entering into dialogues concerning  values in curriculum, because the unit of interest will determine the focus of values-thinking; (2) values-thinking at the conceptual, transactional, and transformational levels is referenced by the mode of thought at the preceding level; (3) practice affects theory building through the interaction of the generative mode of the transformational level with the theoretical level; and (4) the proper focus of study for understanding the valuing process is the interaction between the transactional and transformational levels.

The study was to examine the degree of consensus on behavioral expectations for the occupants of this occupational role, the degree of potential or actual role conflict in this social position, and the manner in which an occupational role is defined and \"learned.\" Most existent conceptual role models need to be reformulated to give them a greater empirical utility. It becomes necessary to develop conceptual frameworks and analytic categories to handle data that reveal different numbers and kinds of relevant alters in respect to different sectors of ego and alter behavior as incumbents of social positions. This suggests that what is usually viewed as a single  role may require subdivision into a number of sub-roles for the explanation of the incumbent's behavior. The common practice of assuming that a particular status or position has associated with it a set of rights and duties on which there is consensus should, therefore, be abandoned. (Authors/WM)",

The definition of competencies is the beginning step in a total competency based program of administrative development. Such definition includes (1) specification of the task or defined role; and (2) indication of the knowledge, ability, or other identifiable characteristics needed to perform the task or role. Competency statements are written in molar form, including required technical, conceptual, and human knowledge skills. These statements are then ordered according to priority and the level of competence (familiarity, understanding, or application) specified. A new model for administrative  development works from an agreed conceptual level about the components needed for an integrated, quality development program and attempts to indicate where differences of opinion lie about implementation within each component. The primary means by which competence is to be attained can be classified in a unified program that extends from formal university instruction into on-the-job education in the field. (Author/WM)",

These same validated statements of competence could also be used as criteria for personnel selection, or for advancement and merit considerations.

A model is presented for a \"Competency Based Curriculum.\" The model includes a competency dimension classified primarily as technical, conceptual, or human; levels of competence to be attained (familiarity, understanding, or application); and the content (subject matter) and processes (methods) to be employed to develop the competency specified. The authors stress that in applying the model, the identification of competencies must include the active  participation of practicing school administrators if competencies are to be relevant and properly analyzed into their component parts.

Present concerns in these areas are producing a good deal of questioning about the professorial role itself. Radical revisions are needed in programs, institutional arrangements, and the professorial role. Results of a questionnaire indicate a push toward (1) competency based training, however that may be defined; (2) extern or off-campus programs with established principals, usually two days per month for credit; (3) block time for teaching integrated content intensively, usually team taught; (4) group process experiences; and (5) individualization. In  terms of instructional methodologies, the survey indicates a changing orientation in favor of the case study and the internship, field projects, simulation, and surveys. There is a need for a study of the institutional arrangements for program development and the conditions of the professorship itself, and for emphasis on improving the institutional conditions that will permit systematic exploitation of the promising practices now available.

The first part of the presentation draws its information from current literature and attempts to set down the theoretical bases of the headmastership. The literature points to certain desirable personal characteristics and leadership qualities, including basic managerial skills and dedication to the educational process and to individual needs. It stresses the need to understand the individuality of each group affected by the school; i.e., students, faculty, staff, parents, trustees, alumni, community members, and an employee and his dependents. Related documents are ED 071 177-78 and headmasters  should be capable of fulfilling the various roles of change facilitator, financial manager, decision coordinator, educational enthusiast, communicator, and evaluator. The second part of the report presents the results of a questionnaire sent to a select group of practicing headmasters. Some of the conclusions derived from the findings indicate that (1) headmasters wish to spend considerably more time conferring with faculty, students, and parents, but not with trustees; (2) the activities of improving instruction and evaluating were performed less frequently than desired; (3) most independent school headmasters have had relatively little experience in public schools; and (4) general experiences in graduate schools are the least helpful in preparing headmasters for their leadership roles.

The ratio of the number of innovations implemented to the number possible for the district was the measure of a district's innovativeness. Each of the three factors investigated had a positive impact on the adoption of educational innovations by the schools. It is suggested that these organizational factors were influential because increased size and complexity generate specialists who search for new solutions to problems within their areas; and environmental complexity and  change pose more complex problems, which must be met by more innovation. Policies and practices for promoting innovation in school districts are proposed. A selected reference list is included. (Author)",

Experimental Ss matched on performance IQ, hand dominance, sex, and chronological age with control Ss were randomly assigned to one of three training groups in which, after two trial runs with the nonpreferred hand to establish baseline, they traced angular, circular, or both angular and circular patterns respectively on the pursuit rotor in eight training sessions. Reinforcement was given in sessions two through eight. Data from such tests as the  Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test and the Koppitz Developmental Scoring System revealed that there were no significant differences between Ss on pretests, that training on the pursuit rotor has specific transfer to figure copying tasks in general, and that the act of training perceptual motor skills is the important variable rather than the specific pattern on which the training is given.

The curriculum presented by Charles Koontz for profoundly retarded children in centers for handicapped minors included task criteria: 359 tasks arranged in 22 progressive levels (the number of levels are given in parentheses) for gross motor (five),  fine motor (five), social (six), and language (six) development, and an activity and a progress card for teacher recording of behaviors and for planning. Philip Peltzman offered a prototype system for detecting hearing loss which utilized a converter with a miniature commercial cassette recorder, whereby the child's electroencephalogram and clinical data could be recorded by an untrained person and sent from the high risk nursery to a data reduction center for quick diagnosis.

Three workshops on role definition involved a group climate inventory, nonverbal and listening exercises, a game illustrating effectiveness of group over individual decision making, a personal growth inventory, and discussion on inadequacy feelings of the team's teachers. Workshops on classroom management taught  teachers to plan and implement classroom token economy systems. Curriculum objectives were incorporated into the school district's curriculum framework, and curriculum goals were reviewed in six workshops. Assisted by school and district personnel, the teachers taught and assessed progress of 35 students and were themselves rated for competency. Activities of the team teaching process and of curriculum development were charted; and treated in 10 appendixes were such topics as student competencies, teacher rating scales, and information on the school system's special education services.

        "description":"Discussed in terms of instrumental and expressive functions are citizen advocacy programs for mentally or physically handicapped children and adults. Instrumental functions are defined as meeting the practical needs of everyday life while expressive functions are said to involve an exchange of affection which meets emotional needs. Major types of prevailing protective services (guardianship, adoptive parenthood, conservatorship, and trusts) are described and critiqued for impersonality of service, conflicts of interest, and impracticality. Citizen advocacy is defined as the provision of aid in the meeting of instrumental and expressive needs of a handicapped individual by a competent citizen volunteer. Advocacy functions required by handicapped children and adults are compared.  Variations of advocacy such as group advocacy, generic advocacy, and crisis advocacy are proposed. A citizen advocacy office at community and state levels is suggested to implement the advocacy concept. Desirable advocate characteristics are said to include the potential for a sustained relationship with the protege and competence in the specific advocacy task. Examples of major advantages of the advocacy schema are a decreased need for professional services and less institutionalization. Current trends emphasizing consumer services, citizen volunteerism, and public disillusion with science and technology are said to make this a propitious time for advocacy programs. Noted are existing programs in Nebraska and Washington. (DB)",

Early neurological development shows a relationship among the creeping period, later communication skills, and visual coordination. Failure to develop bilaterality during the creeping stage may be related to eventual reading problems. Swimming demands of the child the mastery of neurological activities he may have missed earlier.

Characteristic of children entering school is variation in ability and learning style. Some of the children will be referred to special education not because of extreme learning problems but because of poor teaching in the regular classroom. The teacher is the most important variable in the child's educational experience, and the teacher who can effectively individualize instruction will need to refer fewer children to the special educator. Public schools must take an active role in the teacher training process. Children must be protected from experienced teachers who suffer from sporadic mental health problems.  Improved inservice training programs such as university credited courses are needed. Special educators should involve themselves with improving the diagnostic placement process, promoting a view of special education as an extension of regular class placement, and redefining handicapping conditions which require segregated classes.

The study is based on the ideas of architects Michael Bednar and David Haviland, who order exceptionalities along a continuum of intactness of the adaptive mechanism and describe environmental variables in terms of 15 basic environmental conceptualizations such as consistency, privacy, articulation among spaces, movement, and acoustical settings. Presented in chart form by severity of impairment are the intellectual, physical, social/emotional, and vocational characteristics of 10 to 14-year-old handicapped children. A mini-matrix examines the relationship between the program factor of flexibility with the  15 environmental conceptualizations. An observation check sheet is suggested as a means of evaluating whether basic environmental factors conducive to learning for exceptional children exist within a given school. Among the conclusions of the institute participants are the importance of the basic environmental conceptualizations in the effective open middle school and the need for caution in the inclusion of deaf, socially maladjusted, and emotionally disturbed children in the open middle school.

Results showed that highest mean ranking was given to regular class support programs; that second and third mean rankings were given to primary level integrated programs for mildly handicapped children by all but two groups; and that second mean ranking was given by administrators to identification and  prescriptive programs, and by BIA teachers in remote areas to rural support programs. Also, BIA teachers and administrators gave third and fourth mean ranking to primary support and learning disability programs at all levels.

The trainee in the booth views first the entire class (camera 1), then is instructed to select a closeup view of his choice by pushing one of four buttons on the control panel. If trainee preoccupation with one particular view exceeds a predetermined time period, the screen darkens, and the taped voice encourages frequent view changes, typical of an alert teacher.

However, the rules require that some distant programing be blacked out to protect programs under exclusive contract to local standard television stations. The purpose of this study was to show what effect these rules would actually have on programing. Program schedules of independent stations that might be carried as distant signals were compared with lists of programs that would have to be blacked out under the new rules. Because information could be obtained on only four stations--two network affiliates and two independents--on the programs they had under contract, it was necessary to &quot;build up&quot; estimates for different kinds of television markets from  information on these four stations. The summary of the findings is that exclusivity provisions severely restrict distant signal carriage in markets where distant signals are not very important anyway--those with good over-the-air independent service. In markets where distant signals are important--those with little or no over-the-air independent service--the exclusivity provisions leave distant signals more or less intact. (JK)",

The research showed that television uses violence because it is a saleable program commodity and also because violence in a dramatic setting polarize good-evil situations. In regard to the criticism that many children are viewers of crime programs, as indicated by the Nielson ratings, the industry simply refuses to acknowledge the statistics. Also along the same lines, the industry, now  citing research documents, arrogantly asserts that children are able to distinguish television action from reality, without recognizing that such research is admittedly incomplete.

Even though the project was largely unsupervised and plagued with disorganization and equipment problems, children taught with radio did as well as children in the traditional classes, as measured by achievement scores. A more serious problem in the contest of &quot;radioprimaria&quot; is that while education is highly valued as a means to better jobs and a more affluent life style in the cities, the city slums are jammed by the rural influx and there are already more educated persons than there are appropriate jobs. Therefore, &quot;radioprimaria&quot; is seen as somewhat useful in the process of rural education, but rural  education, given current conditions, is hardly useful at all. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"In an effort to reach widely dispersed Indian children and provide them with an early education that will encourage them to enroll in conventional schools after the fourth grade, Jesuit missionaries in a mountainous rural area of Mexico have provided a radio school since 1955. The evaluation reported here reveals that the radio schools have been most useful to those who are not disadvantaged, making integration of the rural Indians into the national culture and economy even more difficult. After an analysis of the problems of the radio schools, a drastic reform plan is presented. (RH)",

        "description":"This is the first report on the instructional television (ITV) project in American Samoa in which it has been possible to base conclusions on any considerable amount of hard data. There is insufficient evidence to make conclusive comparisons of academic levels in 1964, the start of the project, with those today. However, experimental evidence shows that the longer pupils in any given grade had been exposed to television, the better their English performance. This is important as English is the language of instruction. Because they are in English and do not fit the Samoan curriculum or culture, mainland standardized tests are inadequate to measure Samoans' performance. Attitudes toward instruction by television decline sharply in the upper grades and high school, and between  elementary and high school teachers. It is possible that after teaching standards rise (in part because of ITV itself), students and teachers become impatient with the mass and central control of the broadcasts. The annual cost of ITV is about $157 per pupil, plus or minus 15%, including capital equipment and interest. After nine years, the chief administration of the project is in the hands of Samoans, from the director of education down through teachers. (JK)",

The point was made that since America has produced a new type of adolescent to which the traditional regimented high school is inappropriate, it is necessary to develop a new type of institution to fit the modern student. Several cases illustrative of alternatives to traditional schooling are presented, indicating emphases placed upon individual needs, student choices, the social aspects of schooling, and the value of using other community institutions in addition to the school in the  educational program. The final section discusses the elements involved in changing established institutions such as schools, including such matters as money, charisma, the dangers of creating fads, how to break institutional molds, new roles for teachers, leadership, and the overcoming of legal constraints.

Subjects were students in the class and were assigned to treatments in a randomized pretest-posttest control group design. Results of analyses showed that the various treatment groups were all significantly better on  posttest, but did not differ significantly from one another.

The Rand Coporation is developing for the Air Force a means--called Method of Designing Instructional Alternatives (MODIA)--whereby instructors can select a preferred instructional system. Using MODIA, one begins by designating the personnel to be equipped with defined skills and by identifying the training requirements and instructional objectives. Instruction is planned, implemented, and validated. The first step involves the specification of inputs, including instructional plans, teaching strategies and learner characteristics. System design proceeds by linking instructional strategies to curriculum units, by developing configurations of  personnel, media and facilities, by charting student flow through the course, and by analyzing the cost of each component. The results of a completed design cycle using MODIA for design and cost analysis of an innovative Air Force course are presented as an illustration of the method. (PB)",

ITV moved into new facilities and the program was increasingly run by native personnel. General ability and reading scores increased, although there was little difference between television and non-television classes. Behavioral objectives were introduced and students showed increased skills of analysis, synthesis and evaluation. Students were enthusiastic about ITV, but teacher enthusiasm waned somewhat after the initial uncritical acceptance. Their attitudes toward their profession as a whole and its attendant problems, however, were poor. Student aspirations were increasingly high, perhaps unrealistically so, but educational reform was working, as  evidenced by the percentage of students going on to higher education. An observation study of classrooms was conducted and formative evaluation undertaken, both of which shed light upon the system. (PB)",

The aim was to describe the teaching done in the TS system, to compare the two systems, and to examine statistically the relation of teaching and learning activities to student achievement in Math and Spanish. Most teachers relied on lecturing, allowing little student participation or group work. Where a few teachers, usually the better educated ones, did encourage student participation, student achievement was higher. The following implications seemed warranted: 1) the educational level of the individual should be a criterion for selection as a teacher; 2) teachers should provide students with  an introduction to televised instructional programs, to encourage fuller participation; 3) teachers should spend more time in planning their classes; and 4) teacher training should prepare teachers to rely less on lecturing and more on activities which stress individualized learning, student participation, and group work.

This research, however, concentrates on adults; this study is aimed at determining if the generalization holds for teenagers. One hundred and ninety-three female teenage college students were classified into two groups--innovators and non-innovators--on the basis of the number of new fashion product adopted in the course of a year; data were then collected on the number of newspapers and magazines read regularly.  Analysis of the data by means of a Chi Square test showed that the innovative group had substantially more contact with the mass media.

The new, individualized approach to education stresses the importance of student learning, regards the faculty as managers of learning rather than as teachers, and assumes that students learn better when exposed to varied instructional materials. Based on this approach, the learning resources concept must be broadened to combine both print and nonprint collections into an instructional materials center which is properly seen as a means of facilitating learning. Such a learning resource center should be an integral part of the school's total educational program, and not a separate unit which is functionally and  administratively remote from teaching and learning. It should be directed by a specialist in the movement of information from source to user and have a staff characterized by a commitment to service to the learner. (PB)",

The other systems are capable of two-way data transmission and offer such services as opinion polling, cashless financial transactions, computer-aided instruction, and electronic mail delivery. Economic analysis has indicated that cable systems in small markets will be economically viable supplying only CATV, but that they will have to offer Pay-TV in intermediate markets and  the other two-way services in larger markets. The need to offer specialized services to widely scattered groups makes netting, via satellites or other means, highly desirable and this, in turn, requires that systems be designed in accordance with universal standards so that they will be mutually compatible.

        "description":"Educational development requires management, which is basically decision-making based upon information. Information must be processed, involving movement from its source, analysis, transmission, storage, retrieval, summarization, transformation, and reporting. The regulation of this process is the purview of the information management system (IMS), an essential ingredient of educational development. The characteristics of an effective IMS are: relevancy, timeliness, accuracy, comprehensiveness, conciseness, accessibility, and inexpensiveness. Difficulties involved in establishing an IMS in educational development projects stem from the high costs involved, the lack of a stable setting in which to place the system, the changing needs for information, and the danger of inundation  by information overload. Such a system is possible, however, if developers: 1) select the decisions which need to be made; 2) identify the needed information and its sources; 3) choose the proper means of information processing; 4) estimate costs and curtail the system to match cost constraints; and 5) implement and revise the system.

The primary teaching purpose was to develop the idea that a final goal--i.e., winning--could be reached by splitting the final task into sub-tasks. Children who wrote a series of successively better programs developed a sense of the heuristic power of such planning. This led participants to view themselves as models and to acquire ideas about programing based upon their experience; also, the process of debugging programs assisted them in learning to regard their errors as emotionally neutral mistakes rather than as emotionally  charged crises.

Computers, however, can do many other things and it is only inertia and prejudice, not lack of ideas, which stand in the way of broadening the range of computer applications in schools. Several examples, over half of which have already been implemented in elementary schools, are sufficient to prove this point. Computers can be used to move a machine called a Turtle in geometric patterns, play games, draw diagrams, make movies, program musical instruments and compose music, computerize erector sets, make light shows, write poetry, teach physics, and control puppets. People are inclined to think these projects are expensive, but they are usually cheaper  than ones involving teletype machines; such computation would cost about $30 per child annually for one hour of computer time per week, if several hundred students were involved.

Educational innovation, particularly when computers are included, can find better things for children to do and better ways for the child to think about himself doing those things. The combination of the conceptual power of theoretical ideas and the rigorous formalization demanded by computer work, such as writing programs, helps the child to articulate the working of his own mind and to understand the interaction between himself and the rest of reality. He thus not only thinks and learns about the world, but also about the processes of thinking and learning, achieving for  himself the power to deal with whatever he experiences. These conclusions are supported by the results of projects in which elementary students who worked with computers developed an intense involvement with the processes of learning, with better results than found in conventional educational programs.

First, computers make possible new mathematical technologies. Second, they create models for learning about learning and other cognitive skills. Finally, theoretical computer science is a source of research about education. The immediate goal of the project is to create sufficient material in the form of technology to include the  major part of an elementary school curriculum, which will then serve as a model for further research.

Once educators overcome the misconception that the average student can't do math, they can develop new mathematical activities for children, such as those invented by the staff of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. These use computational mathematics projects (in which, for example, a computer regulates the movement of a toy) as vehicles for teaching transferable concepts. They force teachers and students to identify concepts which enable the math beginners to discuss clearly their thinking, they foster personal involvement in mathematics and they encourage children to make creative discoveries. These processes also  lead to an understanding of the concepts of debugging, formalization, side-effects and simplification. In short, computational math is superior to the traditional method of teaching math because it teaches children to mathematize, because it develops heuristic concepts, and because it attends to the mathematical primitives.

Elementary education, traditionally based on memory skills, should become the setting for the development of mental processes and intellectual skills through the activity of problem solving. The child should be led to discover problems, to search for and evaluate solutions, and, finally, to test those solutions. Important for educational reform is the research work of psychologists considering intellectual development and learning processes. (VM)",

Is it the shaping of the oral cavity of the direction of the articulators? The author's observation of an infant through his first year of development indicates that the conscious shaping of the oral cavity appears to precede the communicative use of lip articulation. From the use of pitch by itself, the child introduces the element of shaping the oral cavity, and this produces a vowel. Later, the child adds a third element, articulation, and produces consonants.

Specifically, the belief that world peace can be maintained and that international understanding can be considerably improved through language instruction in public schools--thereby justifying the language requirement--is rejected in favor of a more traditional and inward-looking theory of motivation. Students who learn languages learn to know themselves better and are more capable, therefore, of self-expression. The author also urges that the language teaching profession become more realistic in its appraisal of its status and objectives by taking language  acquisition seriously, refusing to think in terms of courses and credits, and concentrating on proficiency. Other suggestions supporting second language learning in American schools are offered. (RL)",

The behavioral principles seen to be at work are erroneous closure, interrupted behavior, and perceptual conflict.

Lack of continued financial support reduces the work of the Institute and creates the need for help from other sources. The state of Florida has been quite active in  the teaching of English as a foreign language; and the Florida-Colombia Alliance, an organization sponsoring scholarships for Colombian students studying at Florida colleges and universities, should work to have the state university system of Florida use its resources to help with the work of the ILCA.

The author argues that the theories based on these assumptions do not exhibit a reasonable conformity with the phonetic facts and that they cannot provide a basis for generalizations about phenomena beyond those for which they were specifically intended. The purpose of the second paper is  to prove that stress in Aragonese is a completely predictable phenomenon and to postulate a stress rule that will account for the various stress patterns of Aragonese.

The book is a collection of articles on the various types of English spoken mainly in Australia and New Zealand. Articles discuss such varieties as nineteenth and twentieth century Australian English, New Zealand English, Pidgin English in New Guinea, migrant English in Australia, informal English in the Torres Straits, spoken versus written English, and Australian English as used by Asian students. The present reviewer considers each article and concentrates on the sociolinguistic and phonetic aspects in each discussion. (VM)",

        "description":"This article explains the linguistic situation in Greece and the condition of diglossia that has arisen there through the use of common Modern Greek, developing from the Athenian dialect into a medium of communication used by all Greeks, and the use of Katharevusa, the \"pure\" or \"purifying\" language which is supposedly an imitation of Ancient Greek. The author compares selected features of the two languages in the areas of pronunciation, morphology, semantics, syntax, and spelling. A lengthy discussion concerning the historical reasons leading to the existence of modern Greek diglossia is provided along with remarks concerning the creation of Katharevusa. Using Charles Ferguson's theories concerning diglossia typology, the author applies them to the Greek situation and  demonstrates the role of both languages seeking to establish a typology. Concluding remarks concern what effect Greek diglossia is having on Greek education. (VM)",
