THE FOUR MAJOR STEPS TO BE TAKEN FOR THIS STUDY ARE--(1) SURVEY AND SELECTION OF HIGH SCHOOLS, (2) SYSTEM ANALYSIS OF THE FIVE HIGH SCHOOLS SELECTED FOR STUDY, (3) CONSTRUCTION OF A COMPUTER-SIMULATION VEHICLE TO BUILD MODELS OF THE SCHOOLS AND OF HYPOTHETICAL CHANGES IN THE SCHOOLS, AND (4) SIMULATION AND STUDY OF THE FIVE SCHOOLS SELECTED WHICH WILL RANGE FROM FAIRLY TRADITIONAL TO HIGHLY INNOVATIVE. THE SCHOOLS ARE BEING SELECTED BY ANALYSIS OF QUESTIONNAIRES SUBMITTED TO 200 HIGH SCHOOLS IDENTIFIED BY STATE DEPARTMENTS OF EDUCATION AS BEING INVOLVED IN INNOVATION. AT THE TIME OF REPORTING, TWO OF THE FIVE SCHOOLS HAD BEEN SELECTED.  THESE WERE--(1) THE CONTINUOUS PROGRESS PLAN SCHOOL DEVELOPED BY DR. EDWIN READ AT BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY LABORATORY SCHOOL AND (2) THE CULVER CITY HIGH SCHOOL IN LOS ANGELES. ANALYSIS OF THE SCHOOLS CONSISTS OF (1) COLLECTING DATA DESCRIPTIVE OF THE HIGH SCHOOL, AND (2) TRANSLATING THE DATA INTO FLOW CHARTS. FOLLOWING THE ANALYSIS, DESIGN CHANGES IN THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE TO FACILITATE USE OF THE NEW MEDIA WILL BE SUGGESTED AND THESE CHANGES WILL BE EVALUATED BY USE OF THE COMPUTER-SIMULATION VEHICLE. RELATED REPORTS ARE ED 010 559 AND ED 010 577 THROUGH ED 010 581. (AL)",

THE CONSTITUTIONS AND STATUTES OF THE 50 STATES WERE SEARCHED. THE RESULTING DATA WERE COMPILED AND ANALYZED TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH EACH STATE MADE PROVISION FOR THE ORGANIZATION AND OPERATION OF NONPUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. FURTHER, THE CHARTERS OF A STRATIFIED SAMPLE OF NONPUBLIC INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING WERE COLLECTED AND ANALYZED UNDER FOUR CHRONOLOGICAL PERIODS CORRESPONDING TO DATES OF FOUNDING. THE PURPOSE OF THIS  ANALYSIS WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE POWERS GRANTED IN THE CHARTERS JUSTIFIED THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE STATE EXERTED INCREASED CONTROL OVER NONPUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES FROM 1636 TO 1965. THE POWERS CONTAINED IN THESE CHARTERS WERE CLASSIFIED UNDER SEVERAL ACTIVITY AREAS TO SHOW THE TYPE OF POWER GRANTED TO NONPUBLIC INSTITUTIONS BY THE STATES. AS A FINAL ACTIVITY, PRINCIPLES OF COMMON LAW APPLICABLE TO NONPUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION WERE EXAMINED BY REVIEWING AND SUMMARIZING RELEVANT COURT CASES. THE SURVEY FINDINGS OF THE LEGAL STATUS OF NONPUBLIC EDUCATION SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AMONG THE 50 STATES. (GC)",

TO TEST THESE ASSUMPTIONS, THE AUTHOR SERVED FOR 1 ACADEMIC YEAR AS A REGULAR FACULTY MEMBER OF A LEADING NEGRO COLLEGE IN THE COASTAL SOUTH. A REDUCED TEACHING LOAD PERMITTED HIM TO VISIT THE CAMPUSES OF OTHER NEGRO COLLEGES AND TO CONDUCT INTERVIEWS WITH SOCIAL SCIENTISTS (PRINCIPALLY SOCIOLOGISTS) ON THESE CAMPUSES.

THE CONTENT FORMAT WAS ORGANIZED TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK OF RELEVANT AND MEANINGFUL INFORMATION FOR YOUTHS TO USE IN GAINING PERSPECTIVE ON THEMSELVES AND IN ACQUIRING APPRECIATION AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES INVOLVED IN CAREER PLANNING. THE THEORETICAL CONSTRUCT OF DEVELOPMENTAL TASKS (TRYON AND LILIENTHAL, 1950) WAS USED AS ONE BASIS FOR CURRICULUM PLANNING. A TAXONOMY FOR EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES IN THE AFFECTIVE DOMAIN (KRATHWOHL AND OTHERS, 1964) WAS  USED FOR DEFINING CURRICULUM OBJECTIVES, THE NATURE OF DESIRED LEARNING EXPERIENCES, AND MEANS OF EVALUATION. ALTHOUGH THE CURRICULUM WAS DEVELOPED FOR JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL GUIDANCE SESSIONS, A PRELIMINARY TRYOUT INDICATED THAT IT COULD BE READILY ADAPTED FOR USE WITH UPPER ELEMENTARY AND SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AS WELL. STUDENTS EXPOSED TO THE CURRICULUM DURING THE TRYOUT APPEARED TO (1) RESPOND FAVORABLY TO THE NOVELTY OF CONTENT, AS IT WAS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THEIR PLANS AND PERSONAL CONCERNS, AND (2) USE AN OPEN-ENDED, SCIENTIFIC APPROACH IN RELATING THE CONTENT TO THEIR OWN EXPERIENCE.

THE THREE METHODS OF TEACHER EDUCATION STUDIED WERE (1) A SUMMER INSTITUTE, (2) A YEAR-LONG INSERVICE COURSE, AND (3) SELF-INSTRUCTION THROUGH THE USE OF A TEACHER MANUAL. OF THE APPROXIMATELY 620 TEACHERS WHO RECEIVED INSTRUCTION IN THIS PROJECT, 90 WERE SELECTED AS SUBJECTS FOR STUDY, AND 30 ADDITIONAL TEACHERS WERE SELECTED FOR A CONTROL GROUP. THIS CONTROL GROUP DID NOT RECEIVE ANY INSERVICE TRAINING NOR TEACH THE &quot;PROCESS APPROACH.&quot;  EVALUATION WAS CARRIED OUT USING THREE TECHNIQUES--(1) TESTING A RANDOM SAMPLE OF STUDENTS IN THE CLASSES OF PARTICIPATING TEACHERS (FOUR STUDENTS IN EACH CLASS), (2) OBSERVING THE INTERACTIONS IN CLASSES OF PARTICIPATING TEACHERS, AND (3) USING A QUESTIONNAIRE TO ASSESS TEACHER ATTITUDES AND OPINIONS. THE INSTRUMENT USED TO TEST STUDENTS WAS DESIGNED TO MEASURE ACHIEVEMENT ON THE PROCESSES TAUGHT IN THE &quot;PROCESS APPROACH&quot; OF MEASURING, CLASSIFYING, COMMUNICATING, PREDICTING, USING SPACE-TIME RELATIONS, INFERRING, USING NUMBERS, AND OBSERVING. RESULTS FROM ALL EVALUATIONS INDICATED SUPERIORITY OF THE YEAR-LONG INSERVICE COURSE FOR TEACHER EDUCATION. STUDENTS OF TEACHERS IN THE INSERVICE COURSE GROUP ACHIEVED HIGHER ON OVERALL BASES AND REQUIRED LESS DIRECT TEACHER INTERVENTION FOR  LEARNING.

COMMUNICATOR CREDIBILITY WAS DEFINED AS THE EFFECT OF THE IMAGE OF A SPEAKER IN THE MINDS OF A LISTENING AUDIENCE PRIOR TO THE TIME OF UTTERANCE (ARNOLD, 1965). A TOTAL OF 734 COLLEGE STUDENTS ENROLLED IN A BASIC COURSE IN SPEECH SERVED AS THE STUDY SAMPLE. ONE-THIRD OF THESE STUDENTS HEARD A TAPE-RECORDED SPEECH ATTRIBUTED TO A HIGH INITIAL-CREDIBILITY SPEAKER. THE SECOND ONE-THIRD HEARD THE SAME SPEECH GIVEN BY A NEUTRAL-CREDIBILITY SPEAKER. THE SPEAKERS PROPOSED THAT STUDENTS SELECT THE ABSTRACTING OF JOURNAL ARTICLES AS A TERM PROJECT IN SPEECH. THE FINAL ONE-THIRD OF THE STUDENTS WERE ASSIGNED TO A CONTROL GROUP.  STUDENT ATTITUDES WERE PRE- AND POST-TESTED, USING A PREPARED QUESTIONNAIRE WHICH CONTAINED ITEMS RELATED TO SPECIFIC ATTITUDES CONCERNING ABSTRACTING JOURNAL ARTICLES AND TO GENERAL ATTITUDES ON WRITTEN WORK. BEHAVIOR CHOICES WERE CORRELATED WITH THE POST-TEST ATTITUDE SCALE SCORES. THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY INDICATED THAT COMMUNICATOR CREDIBILITY WAS NOT EFFECTIVE IN PRODUCING CHANGE IN GENERAL ATTITUDES, BUT WAS EFFECTIVE IN PRODUCING CHANGE IN SPECIFIC ATTITUDES. HIGH INITIAL CREDIBILITY PRODUCED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ATTITUDE CHANGE THAN NEUTRAL CREDIBILITY, WHICH IN TURN PRODUCED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE CHANGE OF ATTITUDES THAN WAS FOUND IN THE CONTROL GROUP. A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT BUT LOW CORRELATION WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN SPECIFIC ATTITUDE CHANGE SCORES AND OVERT BEHAVIOR, SUGGESTING  THAT ATTITUDE CHANGE IS NOT A PREREQUISITE FOR OVERT BEHAVIOR.

SEVERAL FORMS OF A SOCIAL VALUES QUESTIONNAIRE WERE CONSTRUCTED USING THOSE ITEMS. ALL THE FORMS REQUIRED THE RESPONDENT TO RATE THE EXTENT OF HIS AGREEMENT OR DISAGREEMENT WITH THE OPINION AND  VALUE STATEMENTS DEALING WITH FOUR CLUSTERS OF RELATED DIMENSIONS. THEY WERE THE EVALUATION OF IDENTIFICATION WITH GROUPS, PROBLEMS CREATED BY THE COORDINATION AND REGULATION OF THE ACTIVITIES OF GROUP MEMBERS, REACTIONS TO UNJUST OR ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIORS OF OTHERS, AND THE CONSIDERATION OF THE WELFARE OF OTHERS. AFTER A TEST-RETEST PROCEDURE AND A COMPARISON OF THE VALUES SCORES OF THE TEST SAMPLE WITH TWO GROUPS OF PEACE CORPS TRAINEES AND A GROUP OF UNDERGRADUATES AT A CONSERVATIVELY ORIENTED MEN'S COLLEGE, IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE SOCIAL VALUES QUESTIONNAIRE DID CONVEY INFORMATION ABOUT THE ORIENTATIONS IT WAS DESIGNED TO MEASURE. FURTHER WORK WAS NEEDED, HOWEVER, TO CLARIFY THE FACTORIAL STRUCTURE OF THE DOMAIN BEING ASSESSED BEFORE THE INSTRUMENT COULD BE USED IN LARGE-SCALE STUDIES  OF THE EFFECT OF COLLEGE ATTENDANCE ON VALUES RELEVANT TO GOOD CITIZENSHIP.

TWO INTERRELATED PROBLEMS WERE ALSO TREATED IN THIS STUDY--(1) THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ITAA WHICH WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A SIMPLE AND MORE RELIABLE ALPHABET FOR CHILDREN AND (2) THE IMPORTANCE OF FOCUSING ATTENTION ON CHILDREN'S OWN THOUGHTS AND IDEAS TO DEVELOP SELF-CONFIDENCE IN READING. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN 13 SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN MICHIGAN, WITH EACH DISTRICT DIVIDED INTO THREE SECTIONS, EACH USING ONE APPROACH. THE STUDENTS WERE PRETESTED AND AFTER 140 DAYS OF INSTRUCTION WERE POST-TESTED, AND THE  TREATMENTS WERE COMPARED. INTERPRETATION OF THE TEST RESULTS SHOWED THAT NO ONE APPROACH WAS CONSISTENTLY SUPERIOR. THERE WERE, HOWEVER, DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ACCOMPLISHMENT AMONG THE THREE APPROACHES--(1) ITAA AND LAA CHILDREN DEVELOPED LARGER READING VOCABULARIES AND MORE EFFECTIVE USE OF THEIR POTENTIAL OF WORD ANALYSIS, (2) LAA CHILDREN MADE MORE EFFECTIVE USE OF THEIR INTELLIGENCE IN PARAGRAPH COMPREHENSION, (3) ITAA CHILDREN DEVELOPED A BROADER RANGE OF SKILLS FOR RECOGNIZING ISOLATED WORDS, AND (4) LAA AND BRA CHILDREN WERE BETTER SPELLERS.

THIS DATA CONSISTED OF (1) INFORMATION DRAWN FROM SCHOOL RECORDS, (2) INTERVIEWS WITH STUDENTS, AND (3) QUESTIONNAIRES COMPLETED BY STUDENTS, PARENTS, AND COUNSELORS. MOST OF THE STUDENTS RECOGNIZED THAT EDUCATION WAS IMPORTANT AND, ALTHOUGH THEY DIDN'T HAVE A HIGHLY FAVORABLE ATTITUDE TOWARD VOCATIONAL COURSES, THEY FELT THAT MORE SUCH COURSES SHOULD BE OFFERED BY THE HIGH SCHOOL. EDUCATIONAL ASPIRATIONS WERE HIGH. THREE FOURTHS OF THE STUDENTS EXPECTED TO ATTEND COLLEGE, AND 43.5 PERCENT EXPECTED TO  GRADUATE. OCCUPATIONAL ASPIRATIONS AND EXPECTATIONS WERE ALSO HIGH. MORE THAN SIX OUT OF TEN ASPIRED TO ENTER PROFESSIONAL OCCUPATIONS. RELATIVELY FEW STUDENTS ASPIRED TO BE FARMERS, SALES WORKERS, OPERATIVES, OR LABORERS. THE AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY FOUND TO EXIST AMONG THESE ADOLESCENTS SUGGESTED A NEED FOR PRESENTING SUFFICIENT SYSTEMATIC INFORMATION ABOUT OCCUPATIONS THROUGH THE CURRICULUM TO PERMIT THEM TO MAKE WELL-INFORMED CHOICES.

ALL OF THE COMIT PROGRAMS AND ONE OF THE SNOBOL PROGRAMS USE A LINEARIZED REPRESENTATION OF TREE STRUCTURES, WITH ADDITIONAL NUMERICAL SUBSCRIPTS FOR EASIER IDENTIFICATION OF CORRESPONDING PARENTHESES. A SNOBOL PROGRAM USES INSTEAD A LIST OF NODE NUMBERS, TOGETHER WITH IMMEDIATE ANCESTORS AND DESCENDANTS. A SET OF SUBROUTINES NOW BEING WRITTEN IN COMIT USES MODIFIED POLISH NOTATION, IN WHICH A SUBSCRIPT GIVES THE NUMBER OF NODES IMMEDIATELY DOMINATED BY A GIVEN ONE. ONE SUCCESSFUL COMIT PROGRAM FOR THE PHRASE STRUCTURE OF THE GRAMMAR IS ALSO EXTENDED TO A FEW  TRANSFORMATION RULES, WHICH INVOLVE EMBEDDING.

THE FIRST DEALS WITH THE SO-CALLED \"RELATIONAL\" CONCEPTS. FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS NOT EASY TO SEE HOW ANY SLIGHT MODIFICATION OF THE NOTION OF \"SEMANTIC FEATURE\" CAN LEAD TO THE CORRECT INTERPRETATION OF COMPARATIVE SENTENCES. THE SECOND IS THAT \"ENTAILMENT RULES\" ARE NOT PROVIDED, WHICH OPERATE IN THE FOLLOWING WAY--THERE IS A SENTENCE WHICH CANNOT BY ITSELF BE INTERPRETED BY THE ORDINARY SEMANTIC RULES. BASED ON THE GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURE OF X, THE ENTAILMENT RULES WILL CONVERT X INTO A SET OF SENTENCES Y SUCH THAT EACH OF THESE SENTENCES CAN BE INTERPRETED BY THE ORDINARY SEMANTIC RULES. EXAMPLES OF SITUATIONS IN ENGLISH CALLING FOR ENTAILMENT  RULES ARE GIVEN, NAMELY (1) THE USE OF VERBS LIKE \"KNOW,\"\"REALIZE,\" AND \"BE AWARE,\" (2) USES OF THE WORD \"EVEN\" IN SIMPLE ASSERTIONS AND COMPARATIVE CONSTRUCTIONS, (3) THE VARIOUS TYPES OF CONDITIONAL SENTENCES, AND (4) THE SEMANTIC PROPERTIES OF PAIRS OF WORDS LIKE \"COME\" VERSUS \"GO,\" AND \"BRING\" VERSUS \"TAKE.\" THE CONCLUSION THAT A SEMANTIC THEORY NEEDS AT LEAST SOME RULES OF THE ENTAILMENT TYPE HAS INTRODUCED AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IN THE PERFORMANCE OF SEMANTIC ANALYSIS.

DEVELOPMENTAL MODELS COULD PROVIDE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE BACKDROP AGAINST WHICH TO EVALUATE PEOPLE IF THEY WERE CYCLICAL RATHER THAN LINEAR. A STUDY OF MALES-IN-TRANSITION, THOSE WHO REFUSE TO \"STAY-PUT,\" MIGHT GIVE US CLUES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THOSE WHO CAN AND THOSE WHO CANNOT TRANSFORM, CHANGE, AND PROGRESS. CURRENT MODELS OF HUMAN GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT ARE NOT DESIGNED TO EXPLAIN CHANGE AND GROWTH. THE MISSING LINK IS THE PERSISTENT TENDENCY TO BECOME MORE FIT, MORE COMPETENT. THE NEED TO  FEEL COMPETENT IS SELF-PROPELLING AND A POSITIVE EXPRESSION. COMPETENCY MUST BE CONSIDERED AS A CENTRAL CONCEPT IN UNDERSTANDING ADULT DEVELOPMENT, VIEWED IN A SOCIAL CONTEXT, AND INCLUDED IN DEVELOPMENTAL MODELS.

THE REPORT'S MAJOR SECTION, A COMPREHENSIVE STATE SUMMARY, RANKS FACTORS IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE AS INDICATED BY THE THREE GROUPS OF RESPONDENTS. TEACHING CONDITIONS, PROFESSIONAL LEADERSHIP, ADEQUATE INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS, AND BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES ARE GENERALLY REGARDED AS MOST IMPORTANT. FACTORS RELATED TO SALARY ARE REGARDED AS LEAST IMPORTANT. SUMMARY RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE SUGGESTIONS FOR (1) DEVELOPMENT OF INSERVICE ACTIVITIES REQUESTED BY  TEACHERS, (2) BUDGET ALLOTMENTS FOR EXPENDITURES THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE MOST EFFECTIVELY TO IMPROVEMENT OF INSTRUCTION, AND (3) REFINEMENT OF THIS RESEARCH DESIGN FOR A MORE INCLUSIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT.

MARCH AND SIMON, EXEMPLIFYING MODERN THINKING, CONSIDER GOALS AS BOTH OPERATIONAL, THOSE PERMITTING MEANS-END ANALYSIS, AND NONOPERATIONAL, THOSE REQUIRING SUBGOAL SPECIFICATION BEFORE MEANS-END ANALYSIS. THIS DISTINCTION PRESENTS DIFFERENCES IN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS AND ILLUSTRATES THE EFFECT OF GOALS ON ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE. THE VIEW OF GOALS AS UNDEFINED \"GIVENS\" HAS CHANGED TO ONE OF GOALS AS  INTRINSIC FUNCTIONS IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS.

THE DATA SHOW THAT A BOARD OF EDUCATION EXHIBITS THE SAME TYPE OF POWER STRUCTURE AS ITS COMMUNITY, AND THE SUPERINTENDENT'S ROLE IS A DIRECT FUNCTION OF  BOTH. A DOMINATED COMMUNITY STRUCTURE RESULTS IN A DOMINATED BOARD WHICH CAUSES THE SUPERINTENDENT TO ASSUME THE ROLE OF SERVANT. THIS MODEL IS HELPFUL IN ANALYZING THE FOLLOWING CAUSATIONS IN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS--(1) DOMINATED BOARDS TURN TO ONE MEMBER FOR DECISIONS, (2) FACTIONAL BOARDS DEPEND UPON THE MAJORITY FOR DECISIONS, (3) STATUS CONGRUENT BOARDS DEPEND UPON EXTENSIVE DISCUSSION, AND (4) SANCTIONING BOARDS DEPEND UPON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE SUPERINTENDENT.

BOTH COLLEGE AND SCHOOL FACULTY SHARE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROVIDING THE STUDENT TEACHER WITH PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE IN CONTROLLING CLASSES, SELECTING AND PRESENTING MATERIALS OF DIFFERENT AGE AND ABILITY GROUPS, PROVIDING INDIVIDUAL HELP TO STUDENTS, EVALUATING STUDENTS PROGRESS, PLANNING, CONSTRUCTING LESSON PLANS, MOTIVATING STUDENTS, AND UNDERSTANDING  THE TERM &quot;PROFESSIONAL&quot; IN ITS RELATIONSHIP TO PUPILS AND FACULTY.

        "description":"A \"COURSE DROPOUT\" IS A STUDENT WHO DROPS HIS STUDY OF A FOREIGN LANGUAGE AFTER 2 YEARS IN HIGH SCHOOL. HE FULFILLS HIS MINIMUM FOREIGN LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT FOR COLLEGE ENTRANCE, BUT DOES NOT HAVE A SUFFICIENT MASTERY TO BE EFFECTIVE IN THE LANGUAGE ARTS. THE TREMENDOUS ATTRITION RATE AMONG SECONDARY SCHOOL FOREIGN LANGUAGE STUDENTS HAS MANY CAUSES--INCONSISTENT TEACHING METHODS, POORLY TRAINED OR UNENTHUSIASTIC TEACHERS WHO DO NOT ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO ENROLL IN ELECTIVE ADVANCED CLASSES, BAD CLASS PROGRAMING, AND UNWISE COUNSELING ARE ONLY A FEW. PERHAPS THE CHIEF CAUSE IS THE FALSE ASSUMPTION THAT PROFICIENCY CAN BE ACHIEVED IN 2 YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL, ALTHOUGH IT IS KNOWN THAT FLUENCY INCREASES ONLY WITH CONTINUED LANGUAGE STUDY AND PRACTICE. CERTAIN MEASURES ARE NEEDED TO  CURTAIL THE ATTRITION RATE AND TO ENCOURAGE COURSES OF LANGUAGE STUDY THAT BEGIN IN THE SIXTH GRADE AND CONTINUE THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL.

AN ELEMENTARY COURSE SHOULD BE ORGANIZED SO THAT THE STUDENT LEARNS GREEK ANALYTICALLY BY STUDYING NEW POINTS OF GRAMMAR ONLY AS THEY OCCUR IN THE LITERATURE HE READS. EVEN MORE IMPORTANT IS A \"CULTURE COURSE\" WITH LECTURES GIVEN BY TEACHERS FROM VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS, SUCH AS ART, HISTORY, AND PHILOSOPHY. GREEK MYTHOLOGY, GREEK RELIGION, GREEK LITERARY GENRES, AND GREEK SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS ALL ARE MOST RELEVANT TO A STUDENT'S UNDERSTANDING OF \"THE  INTERRELATIONS AND UNITIES OF HIS OWN CULTURE BOTH IN SPACE AND TIME.\" SUCH A COURSE WOULD NOT NECESSITATE A KNOWLEDGE OF GREEK LANGUAGE.

CULTURALLY DEPRIVED PEOPLE ARE DEFINED AS THOSE AMERICANS WHO BELONG TO THE LOWER SOCIOECONOMIC GROUP AND WHO HAVE FEWER OPPORTUNITIES THAN THE AVERAGE CITIZEN. RESEARCH ON THE READING ABILITY OF DISADVANTAGED ADULTS HAS SHOWN THAT THEY READ LESS THAN MORE EDUCATED PEOPLE AND COMPRISE A LARGE NUMBER OF THE AMERICAN FUNCTIONAL ILLITERATES. CORRELATIONS WERE FOUND BETWEEN  CHILDREN'S READING ACHIEVEMENT AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. THE HOME ENVIRONMENT OF LOWER CLASS CHILDREN CONTRIBUTES TO READING RETARDATION. ADULTS WHO HAVE HAD MORE EDUCATIONAL TRAINING TEND TO MAKE GREATER USE OF LIBRARY FACILITIES. LOWER CLASS PEOPLE READ MAGAZINES AND PAPERS SOMEWHAT LESS THAN THOSE FROM HIGHER CLASSES. DIFFERENCES, HOWEVER, ARE NOT AS GREAT AS THOSE FOUND IN BOOK READING. A POSITIVE CORRELATION EXISTS BETWEEN FICTION READING AND INCOME LEVEL, AND BETWEEN CHOICE OF AUTHORS AND SOCIOECONOMIC LEVEL. LOWER CLASS PEOPLE TEND TO READ THE NEWSPAPER FOR ENTERTAINMENT, SENSATIONAL NEWS, AND PICTORIAL MATERIAL. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR LIBRARIES ARE MADE.

DATA WERE OBTAINED THROUGH INTERVIEWS WITH RESPONSIBLE PERSONS REPRESENTING 267 OF THE 2,053 BUSINESSES EMPLOYING 32,776 PERSONS. IT WAS ESTIMATED THAT 5,050 PERSONS WERE EMPLOYED WHO WOULD FIND  THE KNOWLEDGE OF AGRICULTURE USEFUL OR NECESSARY IN THEIR OCCUPATION, AND THAT 2,154 ADDITIONAL AND REPLACEMENT EMPLOYEES WOULD BE NEEDED DURING THE NEXT 5 YEARS. TABLES EXPLAIN THE NEEDS OR LACK OF NEEDS OF VARIOUS OCCUPATIONAL FAMILIES. OF THE 5,050 PERSONS NEEDING AGRICULTURAL COMPETENCIES, 2,610 OR 51.7 PERCENT WERE EMPLOYED AT PROFESSIONAL, MANAGERIAL, AND SUPERVISORY LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT. TO MEET EMPLOYMENT NEEDS, EACH OF DELAWARE'S 16 HIGH SCHOOLS WITH DEPARTMENTS OF VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE SHOULD HAVE 34 GRADUATES EACH YEAR. (PA)",

THE SECOND PART DEALT WITH PRINCIPLES OF FORMING GENERALIZATIONS. QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION AND ASSIGNMENTS FOR SPEAKING WERE INTENDED TO HELP THE STUDENT DESCRIBE PHENOMENA. ANALYSIS OF STRUCTURAL PATTERNS AND STYLES APPROPRIATE TO DIFFERENT SPEAKING PURPOSES WERE PROVIDED IN THE EXERCISES. THE THIRD PART DEALT WITH WAYS AND PURPOSES OF WRITING AND DISCUSSING DIFFERENT  POINTS-OF-VIEW. THE EXERCISES PROVIDED A SOMEWHAT LESS RIGID WRITING EXPERIENCE THAN THE PREVIOUS MATERIALS WHICH DEMANDED CONFORMITY TO EXACTING STYLES AND DEFINITIONS. THE EXERCISES WERE ALSO INTENDED TO REMIND THE STUDENT, BY STIMULATING HIS IMAGINATION, OF THE GAINS POSSIBLE BY RESPECTING OTHER POINTS OF VIEW. THE STUDENT VERSION IS ED 010 805. RELATED REPORTS ARE ED 010 129 THROUGH ED 010 160 AND ED 010 803 THROUGH ED 010 832. (PM)",

WAYS WERE SUGGESTED FOR STUDENTS TO COMPILE THEIR OWN WORD-NOTEBOOKS OR ABBREVIATED DICTIONARY LISTS SO THAT THEY MIGHT UNDERSTAND THE DIFFICULTY AND SKILLS REQUIRED FOR DEFINING NEW TERMS, EXPANDING OR LIMITING DEFINITIONS TO MEET CHANGING USAGES, AND ANALYZING PATTERNS OF DEFINITION. THE GUIDE'S SECOND SECTION COMMENTED ON THE HISTORY AND CHANGES OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. EXAMPLES FROM WRITINGS OF GOEFFREY CHAUCER, WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN WERE GIVEN.  THE EARLY MODERN ENGLISH OF SHAKESPEARE EXEMPLIFIED IN &quot;THE MERCHANT OF VENICE&quot; WAS COMPARED TO AND CONTRASTED WITH TODAY'S MODERN ENGLISH, COMPARING VOCABULARY, WORD LOSSES, SHIFTS IN MEANING, AND GRAMMAR FORMS. SHAKESPEAREAN ENGLISH WAS CHOSEN FOR STUDY BECAUSE OF SHAKESPEARE'S WIDESPREAD AND ENDURING POPULARITY, THE COMPARATIVE EASE OF READING BY A MODERN AUDIENCE, AND THE STANDARDIZATION IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE THAT OCCURRED IN LONDON IN THE EARLY 17TH CENTURY. VARIOUS STUDENT EXERCISES THAT COMBINE LEXICOGRAPHY WITH STUDIES OF LITERATURE AND THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE WERE SUGGESTED THROUGHOUT THE GUIDE. PART 2 IS ED 010 824. RELATED REPORTS ARE ED 010 129 THROUGH ED 010 160 AND ED 010 803 THROUGH ED 010 832. (PM)",

NEARLY 16,000 BOYS AND GIRLS FROM 17 COUNTIES IN ALABAMA, MISSISSIPPI, NORTH CAROLINA, AND VIRGINIA WERE SURVEYED BY MEANS OF A QUESTIONNAIRE. FOR MANY OF THESE STUDENTS, ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION WAS OBTAINED FROM SCHOOL RECORDS. FINDINGS OF THE SURVEY INDICATED THAT (1) ABOUT 40 PERCENT OF THE WHITE SUBSAMPLE, BUT ONLY ABOUT 20 PERCENT OF THE NEGRO SUBSAMPLE, PLANNED TO ATTEND COLLEGE IN THE YEAR AFTER HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION, (2) LESS THAN 10 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL SAMPLE INDICATED THEY MIGHT ATTEND COLLEGE AT A LATER DATE, AND (3) THAT PART OF THE SAMPLE PLANNING TO DROP OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL BEFORE GRADUATION INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY  25 PERCENT OF THE NEGRO BOYS, 17 PERCENT OF BOTH THE WHITE BOYS AND NEGRO GIRLS, AND 14 PERCENT OF THE WHITE GIRLS. CHARACTERISTICS OTHER THAN RACE WHICH APPEARED TO BE RELATED TO LEVEL OF EDUCATIONAL EXPECTATIONS AMONG THE SAMPLE (INCLUDING INTELLECTUAL, SOCIAL, AND MATERIAL FACTORS) WERE STATISTICALLY PRESENTED AND DISCUSSED. TYPICALLY, WHEN SUCH CHARACTERISTICS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH ELEVATED EDUCATIONAL GOALS, THE ASSOCIATION POINTED TO COLLEGE PLANNING FOR WHITES AND TO FIRM INTENTIONS NOT TO DROP OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL FOR NEGROES.

IN COMMENTING ON COMMUNITY NEEDS, GORDON BLACKWELL POINTS OUT THE DIMENSIONS OF THE COMMUNITY WHICH DETERMINE THE PURPOSE OF THE EVENING COLLEGE (THE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION, ITS INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE, VALUE SYSTEMS, SOCIAL STRATIFICATION, INFORMAL SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS, POWER STRUCTURE, AND  ECOLOGY). HORACE KALLEN DESCRIBES THE HUMAN QUALITIES OF THE INDIVIDUAL THAT ARE OF INTEREST TO THE EDUCATOR (HIS DESIRE FOR KNOWLEDGE IN ORDER TO SURVIVE AND BE FREE).

A TOTAL OF 444 TRAINEES IN SPANISH AND 51 TRAINEES IN PORTUGUESE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO WERE GIVEN PLACEMENT TESTS AND LANGUAGE APTITUDE AND PROFICIENCY TESTS AT VARIOUS STAGES OF THE TRAINING PROGRAM. RESULTS SHOWED THAT PRIOR KNOWLEDGE, NOT APTITUDE, DETERMINED THE DEGREE OF FLUENCY. A FOLLOWUP STUDY WAS DONE IN THE FIELD WITH SIMILAR RESULTS. RECOMMENDATIONS WERE MADE RESPECTING (1) LENGTH OF COURSE, (2) FURTHER TRAINING IN  THE FIELD, (3) THE IMPORTANCE OF VARIABLES SUCH AS APTITUDE AND PRIOR KNOWLEDGE IN TRAINEE SELECTION, AND (4) DEVELOPMENT OF A PROGRAM OF LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY MEASUREMENT.

THE STUDY WAS CONCERNED PRIMARILY WITH A LARGE SOUTHEASTERN COLLEGE WITH 12 SCHOOLS. DATA INCLUDED COLLEGE BOARD SCHOLASTIC APTITUDE TEST SCORES, HIGH SCHOOL AVERAGE GRADES, AND FRESHMAN AVERAGE GRADES OF THE 1,025 FRESHMEN WHO COMPLETED 40 HOURS OF WORK IN JUNE 1965. COMPUTER PROCESSING WAS PERFORMED FOR BOTH ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE AND MULTIPLE DISCRIMINANT FUNCTION ANALYSIS. COMPARATIVE DATA WERE ANALYZED FROM THREE SMALLER INSTITUTIONS--A NEGRO COEDUCATIONAL COLLEGE, A 4-YEAR WOMEN'S LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGE, AND A 2-YEAR COEDUCATIONAL JUNIOR COLLEGE. A  RELATIVELY SMALL STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND TO EXIST IN GRADING PRACTICES AMONG THE SEVERAL SCHOOLS OF THE LARGE COLLEGE, NULLIFYING THE HYPOTHESIS THAT STUDENTS IN ACADEMIC DIFFICULTY WILL TRANSFER TO THE EASIER SCHOOL. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN STUDENT ACADEMIC ABILITY WERE FOUND AMONG THE FOUR SEPARATE COLLEGES. ON THE BASIS OF GRADES IN RELATION TO APTITUDE, THEREFORE, STUDENTS CANNOT BE CLASSIFIED AMONG SCHOOLS WITHIN THE SINGLE LARGE INSTITUTIONS, BUT THEY CAN BE CLASSIFIED AMONG THE FOUR SEPARATE INSTITUTIONS.

FINDINGS WERE COMPILED FROM PERSONAL INTERVIEWS WITH RESPONSIBLE PERSONNEL AT EACH INSTITUTION. ALL OF THE SCHOOLS OFFER PROGRAMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION LEADING TO THE D.ED. OR THE PH.D. A RELATIVELY CONSISTENT PATTERN EXISTS AMONG THE SCHOOLS WITH RESPECT TO COURSE WORK, FIELD EXPERIENCES, STATISTICS, INTERNSHIPS, SEMINARS, AND DISSERTATION RESEARCH. ALL INSTITUTIONS INCLUDE COURSE WORK IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES, WITH DISCIPLINES AND THEIR FREQUENCIES  AS FOLLOWS--SOCIOLOGY (17), ECONOMICS (16), POLITICAL SCIENCE (15), PSYCHOLOGY (11), ANTHROPOLOGY (8), BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION (5), PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (4), HISTORY (3), PHILOSOPHY (2), GOVERNMENT (2), COMMUNICATIONS (2), AND HUMAN RELATIONS (1). SEMESTER HOURS REQUIRED FOR INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES RANGE FROM NO MINIMUM TO A MINIMUM OF 24, WITH MOST SCHOOLS FAVORING SOCIAL SCIENCES. ABOUT HALF THE SCHOOLS ARRANGE SEMINARS FOR THEIR STUDENTS THROUGH THE INTERDISCIPLINARY CLASSES OFFERED FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS IN ALL DEPARTMENTS.

CONSIDERATION OF EDUCATIONAL CHANGE AS SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE PRESUPPOSES EXPLORATION OF THE DIFFICULTIES THAT RESTRICT THE MEETING OF THE ACCEPTED SCIENTIFIC CRITERIA OF DESCRIPTION, EXPLANATION, PREDICTION, AND CONTROL AS WELL AS THE SCIENTIFIC METHODOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS OF OBJECTIVITY AND SKEPTICISM. WITHIN AN ESTABLISHED BODY OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE A STRUCTURE OF PHENOMENA IN LOGICAL RELATIONS AND A METHODOLOGY MADE UP OF DEFINITE RULES OF PROCEDURE CAN BE DISCERNED. WITHOUT A STRUCTURE OF RELATIONS AND PROCEDURAL METHODOLOGY, INQUIRIES MAY OR MAY NOT LINK UP WITH EACH OTHER AND RESULT IN AN ACCUMULATION OF FINDINGS RATHER THAN A  CUMULATION OF RESULTS. AN INADEQUACY OF THIS NATURE IS CHARACTERISTIC OF KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING EDUCATIONAL CHANGE. WITHOUT CONSENSUS UPON THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK OF RELATIONAL AND METHODOLOGICAL FACTS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO FORMULATE THEORIES THAT SYNTHESIZE LARGE AREAS OF WELL-ESTABLISHED FACT. THE ATTEMPT TO MAKE A SCIENCE OUT OF ANY SOCIAL PHENOMENA IS CONSTANTLY QUESTIONED BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT SUBJECTIVITY OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCES, THE VALUE FACTORS OF BOTH INVESTIGATOR AND INVESTIGATED PHENOMENA, AND THE COMPLEXITY OF GROUP DYNAMICS. A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR EDUCATIONAL CHANGE SHOULD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THESE INHERENT DIFFICULTIES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL PHENOMENA ANALYSIS. ITS SCIENTIFIC STUDY COULD PROCEED ALONG THE TWO LINES--(1) AN EXTRAPOLATION OF EXISTING TRENDS IN  SOCIAL SUBSYSTEMS AND A SPECULATION OF CONSEQUENCES, AND (2) AN EMPHASIS ON CRITICISM OF WHAT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED, INCLUDING AN EXAMINATION OF CONSISTENCY, EMPIRICAL CONSEQUENCES, AND ATTEMPTS AT FALSIFICATION.

STRATEGY 2, AN INSTITUTE FOR THE STUDY OF EDUCATIONAL INNOVATION, WOULD FOCUS PRIMARILY ON THE CREATION OF NEW CONCEPTS FOR ADVANCING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND WOULD BE PRIVATELY SUPPORTED, STAFFED BY LEADING SCHOLARS ON 1-YEAR FELLOWSHIPS,  AND LOCATED NEAR A MAJOR UNIVERSITY.

MANY TRAVEL GREAT DISTANCES TO WORK. A SURVEY OF 12TH-GRADE STUDENTS INDICATES THAT A MAJORITY INTEND TO GO TO A TRADE SCHOOL OR A JUNIOR COLLEGE. VERY FEW APPEAR TO BE INTERESTED IN SCIENTIFIC FIELDS. STATED VOCATIONAL GOALS INDICATE A GREAT NEED FOR VOCATIONAL COUNSELING. IT IS HOPED THAT THE COUNSELING RATIO WILL BE 250 TO 1. APTITUDE TESTS GIVEN AT THE POTENTIAL FEEDER HIGH SCHOOLS INDICATE THAT APPROXIMATELY 39 PERCENT OF THE INCOMING STUDENTS WOULD BE  ON A PROBATIONARY STATUS AND IN NEED OF SPECIAL REMEDIAL PROGRAMS. IN ORDER TO ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM OF DE FACTO SEGREGATION, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THIS COLLEGE MIGHT OFFER COURSES NOT GIVEN AT OTHER COLLEGES, AND THUS DRAW STUDENTS FROM OTHER AREAS. THE COLLEGE SHOULD SERVE THE COMMUNITY IN PROVIDING MEETING PLACES, ATHLETIC FACILITIES, AND AN ADULT EVENING SCHOOL. (HS)",

        "description":"THIS DOCUMENT STATES THAT BETWEEN 1952 AND 1961 APPROXIMATELY 50,000 RESERVATION INDIANS WERE ASSISTED BY THE BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS TO RELOCATE IN MANY OF THE LARGER METROPOLITAN AREAS OF THE UNITED STATES. THEIR SUCCESS IN CITY LIFE HAS BEEN LARGELY DEPENDENT UPON SATISFACTORY ADJUSTMENT TO THE LOCAL URBAN COMMUNITY LIFE SO FOREIGN TO THEM. THE AUTHOR POINTS OUT THAT BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE INDIAN AMERICAN IS NEEDED TO ASSIST THESE PEOPLE IN MAKING THE ADJUSTMENT. HE DISCUSSES THE INDIAN CONTRIBUTIONS TO AMERICAN LIFE, THEIR PRESENT NEEDS, THEIR CULTURAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND LANGUAGE PATTERNS, AND THEIR MAJOR CULTURAL CONCEPTS IN COMPARISON WITH WESTERN CULTURE. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT ORGANIZED GOVERNMENT CAN HELP INDIAN PEOPLE RELOCATE, BUT THE KEY FACTOR IN THE FINAL  PROCESS OF SUCCESSFUL ADJUSTMENT AND FULL PARTICIPATION IN THE LIFE OF THE COMMUNITY IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY. THESE MEMBERS NEED TO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEMS OF THE INDIAN AMERICAN. THIS PAPER IS AN EXTENSION OF REMARKS GIVEN AT THE NAIRO CONFERENCE (SAN FRANCISCO, NOVEMBER 9, 1961). (RB)",

AS PART OF THE PLAN TO ESTABLISH MIDDLE SCHOOLS (INSTITUTED IN A SYSTEMWIDE 4-4-4 GRADE DISTRIBUTION) TO PROMOTE INTEGRATION AND QUALITY EDUCATION, SPECIFIC JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS HAD BEEN SELECTED TO RECEIVE THE NEW SIXTH GRADE.

IT WAS FOUND THAT TEACHERS AS A GROUP OUTPERFORM NONTEACHERS AS A GROUP AND THAT PERFORMANCE IS SENSITIVE TO THE EFFECTS OF TEACHING EXPERIENCE. INTELLIGENCE, READING COMPREHENSION, MINNESOTA TEACHERS ATTITUDE INDEX (MTAI) SCORE, AND SIZE OF INSTITUTION AT WHICH A TEACHER PREPARES ARE INDEPENDENT VARIABLES POSITIVELY RELATED TO PERFORMANCE.  THE SPLIT-HALF RELIABILITY FOR THE MOST VALID SCORE WAS .84 AMONG TEACHERS AND .87 AMONG STUDENT TEACHERS.

ELIMINATION OF THIS GAP WAS CONSIDERED BY THE INVESTIGATOR TO BE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE STUDENTS A SEQUENTIAL EDUCATION. TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE GAP AND THE FACTORS CONCERNED, 3,000 QUESTIONNAIRES WERE DISTRIBUTED NATIONWIDE TO THREE SEPARATE GROUPS--1,000 TO HIGH SCHOOL CHEMISTRY TEACHERS, 1,000 TO FIRST-YEAR COLLEGE CHEMISTRY PROFESSORS, AND 1,000 TO FIRST-YEAR COLLEGE CHEMISTRY STUDENTS. RESPONDENTS RATED NUMEROUS ASPECTS OF CHEMISTRY INSTRUCTION ON A THREE-POINT SCALE OF  IMPORTANCE. THE AUTHOR THEN RANKED EACH ITEM IN ITS ORDER OF IMPORTANCE ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF RESPONDENTS IN EACH GROUP WHO HAD RANKED THAT ITEM AS &quot;VERY IMPORTANT.&quot; THREE RESULTING LISTS WERE STATISTICALLY COMPARED, AND THE DIFFERENCES IN RESPONSE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS OF TEACHERS WERE TESTED AT THE .01 LEVEL. OF THE 10 AREAS IN WHICH THE TWO GROUPS DIFFERED MOST, SEVEN WERE SHOWN TO HAVE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES.

        "description":"About 2,200 immigrant children in Sweden were studied by means of tests and teacher questionnaires. The children, representing 36 nationalities, were born outside Sweden and were distributed over the nine grades of the Swedish Comprehensive School. Various functional language skills in Swedish as a second language (L2), nonverbal intelligence and socio-emotional adjustment as measured by teacher opinions were studied as functions of age and length of residence. These two independent variables were found to be uncorrelated with each other and with a number of other background variables. All language variables were rather strongly related to age, and the F ratios were highly significant with one exception, Free Oral Production. The language variables were weakly or not at all  related to length of residence, with the exception of Free Oral Production. The socio-emotional variables were not related to age, nor to length of residence. The pattern of nonverbal intelligence is inconsistent. As the relation of language to age is positive, i.e., L2 learning ability increases with age in the span of 7 - 17, and no optimum is found, it is suggested that the theoretical position of Penfield and Roberts, Lenneberg and others, which predict an optimum in L2 learning ability before puberty, is not tenable.

The major questions examined were: (1) Are the students suffering a deficit in English oral and reading skills? (2) How are the students progressing in Spanish oral and reading skills? (3) Are the students achieving at grade level in a non-language subject matter, i.e., mathematics? (4) What are the attitudes of the participating students, teachers, and parents toward the Spanish immersion program? The findings indicate that the students are: (1) not suffering a deficit in English oral or  reading skills; (2) progressing satisfactorily in Spanish oral and reading skills; (3) achieving at grade level in mathematics; (4) developing positive attitudes toward the Spanish language and culture, and toward foreign language learning in general. Both the immersion teachers and parents strongly supported the program and advocated its continuation. (Author/KM)",

These grades in Chinese were correlated with the children's age in months and with their scores on two subtests of the Wing Standardised Test of Musical Intelligence and five subtests of the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities. All correlations between age, musical talent and psycholinguistic abilities on the one hand and achievement in Chinese on the other were positive, but only correlations with certain of the subscales of the ITPA were statistically  significant. The results suggest a positive relationship between psycholinguistic maturity and potential success in foreign language learning. (Author)",

        "description":"Coincidental changes in the perceived nature of Australian society and in the linguistic sciences are creating urgent needs for the re-education of Australian language teachers. Recognition of the pluralism of Australian society has highlighted the inappropriateness of the languages, objectives, and methods of traditional language teaching. Similarly, rapid changes in insights into the nature of language and of language learning are leaving the approaches common in the schools outdated and largely ineffectual. A recent study has shown, in fact, that this inefficiency and its concomitant low exit-point proficiency levels are the major cause of the recent decline in student numbers. These factors make the need for the continual re-education of language teachers of increasing  urgency in order to provide teachers with facility in more appropriate languages, to enhance teacher proficiency in the existing languages, to update teachers' cultural understanding, and, from a rational understanding of the nature of language and of how it is learned, to increase teachers' methodological effectiveness.

        "description":"Marked incongruity exists between the present language teaching system in Australia and the nation's social structure. Few of the languages spoken in the community by major ethnic groups are taught in the schools and little effect of the society's pluralism is evident in objectives and methods. Three causes of this situation are examined, and new roles for language teaching that will match social needs are discussed. One major goal emerges as the fostering of favorable cross-cultural attitudes. This leads to community involvement approaches to second language teaching and extends second language learning into the realm of personality development. Erikson's &quot;identity crisis&quot; and &quot;intimacy crisis&quot; and Freire's notion of &quot;conscientization&quot; are used to elucidate student needs and to  suggest desirable approaches to methodology. Consideration of insights from modern linguistic and psycholinguistic studies leads to similar implications for teaching practice. In brief, students learn best through using the language in real and purposeful communication and cross-cultural attitudinal development necessitates interaction with native speakers. Such needs seem to be best catered for in community involvement activities as an integral and integrating part of a language course. (Author)",

Language development occurs through a self-directed grammar program, the teaching of language functions, discourse and cohesion, relevant registers, and practical use of the four macroskills. Attitudinal development is catered for through general culture learning; Social Studies; language games, reading and discussion focusing on attitudinal issues; and, especially, through community involvement. All these  activities also involve major components that promote language development through meaningful use of the language. The learning strategies that are involved are outlined and the methods used to evaluate the program are referred to. The courses that utilize this approach are being developed at the Mount Gravatt College of Advanced Education, Brisbane, Australia. (Author)",

The basic assumption is that scientific grammars only describe the production of language by native speakers, while pedagogical grammars are sets of rules ordered in such a way as to most efficiently teach a non-native speaker to produce grammatical utterances in the target language. The paper deals with considerations that must be taken into account in sequencing the grammatical items and patterns chosen to be included in the pedagogical grammar. Frequency of use as well as difficulty for the learner will determine placement in the rule sequence. Several aspects of the problem of defining difficulty are  presented along with information provided by contrastive analysis and error analysis. Additional considerations such as logical ordering, variety, re-entry (cycling), symmetry, and others are also discussed. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This paper discusses a student's view of the teaching of literature with respect to: (1) the nature of literature, and (2) the learning process. B. A. programs in French generally include courses designed to \"cover\" certain areas of literature. These courses involve, usually, \"ex cathedra\" lecturing, implying first that there is one \"correct\" interpretation of a given work which the professor imparts to the student, and secondly that learning is passive in nature; the student \"receives\" the \"correct\" interpretation. The implicit goal of literature study is thus to amass a body of knowledge. This paper suggests that learning is an active process and that works of literature acquire their meaning through the active participation of the reader; therefore, more extensive use of a  Socratic approach to teaching would be more appropriate and beneficial. It is proposed as well that the goal of undergraduate literature study be that of helping students discover the methods of literary study rather than absorbing a sum of knowledge. Finally, the paper stresses the need for research in the area of teaching the foreign literature, a field largely neglected, and urges that consideration be given to fundamental questions of learning theory and theory of literature.

The acquisition of reference is set within a broader discussion of linguistic representation, which defines language as a system functioning in a three-way relationship among the individual language user, the world of experience, and the social community. It is argued that the essential function of human language is to allow indirect (rather than direct) reference, and hypotheses are presented on how the child's motivation, his assumptions about what language is for, and his level of linguistic consciousness determine the role of indirect reference in children's learning of names. In an experiment eliciting indirect reference, four naming strategies were hypothesized: overgeneralization of a real  (but incorrect) name, frustration, description, and made-up names. Twelve Ss between the ages of 3;1 and 4;4 were presented strange and novel items in picture and object contexts and asked to name those items once the stimuli were removed. The least mature Ss used mostly over-generalized names. More mature Ss showed some frustration and used both overgeneralization and description. The most mature Ss showed an increased number of descriptions and used made-up names as well. (Author/KM)",

It has been noted in the past that among institutions operating at a deficit there was a distinct correlation between the size of the annual deficit and the institutions' appropriations for student aid. There is a philosophical concern in this cost formula that results from government intervention. Implications of this intervention are discussed. There is evidence that some institutions have become careless in their administration of federally-sponsored student aid programs, especially in collections, and all institutions are beginning to suffer. It is suggested that the regulations surrounding the administration of student aid programs not only have resulted in  administrative reference that destroys diversity, but also have affected other areas of the postsecondary academic experience. Consideration is given to the effect of impoundments, accreditation powers, and court decisions influencing higher education. (LBH)",

The court found that, despite their formal affiliation, appellee colleges are not&quot;pervasively sectarian.&quot; The court also found that aid was in fact extended only to the &quot;secular side,&quot; and that state officials do not have to investigate particular classes to determine whether a school is indoctrinating its students under the guise of secular education. The Supreme Court affirmed this decision, concluding that the Maryland Act does not violate the Establishment Clause. (LBH)",

This publication focuses on 11 campus faculty development centers in four-year institutions. Centers chosen for inclusion are those that have assigned staff, are funded at least in part by the institution, provide more than conventional media services, and have as their primary focus improving teaching effectiveness at the undergraduate level. The centers described are located at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of Florida,  University of Kentucky, Appalachian State University, Memphis State University, University of Tennessee at Knoxville, University of Texas at Arlington, University of Texas at Austin, Virginia Commonwealth University, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. The growth of these centers may represent a trend toward translating the traditional institutional verbal commitment to teaching into formal arrangements and budgetary support for genuine and professional efforts to stimulate effective instruction.

As a pilot project, PSR explored current public service efforts by higher education in the local black community, efforts being made by community service offices of other Illinois institutions of higher education, and, most importantly, local black community perception of current and future activities in the community. The results were obtained by a series of three surveys and a conference of local black community residents and black personnel at the two institutions. Some major findings were that: (1) the black  community has a low level of familiarity with existing public service efforts of the two educational institutions; (2) an information center would be utilized by black community residents; (3) community and education leaders should work together to develop programs to meet community needs; and (4) the institutions should accelerate affirmative action programs to increase the number of jobs and job training programs for black community residents.

Selected courses, developed and implemented in the university by cooperating academic departments and the Center for Instructional Development, are piloted on campus and then offered for both high school and university credit in participating high schools as part of their regular school programs. Students are charged a modest overhead fee for the course and receive regular Syracuse University credit, which is widely transferable to other colleges and universities throughout the country. The courses are part of the regular teaching load of the high school teachers, who attend special university training workshops and seminars and teach the course under the supervision of  university faculty. The grading standards for the course are identical both on and off campus. The project has expanded since its implementation in 1973 from 400 to 3,400 students in 58 schools. Conclusions are presented regarding: description of students; project helpfulness in college admissions; transfer of academic credit; academic achievement prediction; student expectations of college; enrollment and distribution of grades; and priorities of students, parents, and school personnel.

Questionnaire responses were obtained from 1,148 departments at 137 institutions. They indicate that the proportions of young faculty members have been declining over the past seven years and, in most fields, are estimated to continue to decline. The situation appears most critical in the fields of physics, biology, geology, mathematics, and mining and mineral engineering, physiology, and zoology. In all these fields, the proportions of young doctorates--either in 1975 or as estimated for 1980 or both--fall below what is  regarded by most department heads as the most desirable proportion. Those department heads who expressed concern about the age imbalance within their faculties suggested a variety of means for increasing the proportion of young doctorates. Generally, however, they are not optimistic that these means will be adopted in the near future. (LBH)",

The effort was undertaken because of deeply held concern about both the adequacy of the resources provided and the equity of the distribution of the available funds to the several institutions. It was determined that reliance on a student-teacher ratio or a cost-per-student basis as an exclusive measure for allocating/acquiring funds does not assure equity and that a line-item budget neither assures equity nor permits the administrative flexibility essential to a dynamic institution. A Resource Allocation/Acquisition Model was proposed that considers separately the sums for each of seven functions: instruction, nonsponsored research, extension and  public services, libraries and museums (academic support), student services, operation and maintenance of the physical plant, and general institutional support. Implementation of the model and further analysis needs related to it are described. (LBH)",

        "description":"Undergraduate enrollment patterns among state colleges and universities changed dramatically between 1969 and 1974, including large differences in enrollment growth between rural and urban institutions and among various regions of the country. Overall enrollment patterns reflected logical reactions of students and their parents to college financing problems. The cost of college attendance rose and large numbers of students chose lower-cost educational opportunities. This study, based on information from 247 state colleges and universities, also found that institutions that charged low tuitions but lost undergraduate enrollment were usually located in rural areas where per capita income was considerably below the statewide average. Few institutions in urban areas lost enrollment.  No urban institution charging annual tuition and fees lower than $200 in 1974 experienced an enrollment decline, whereas some charging over $600 a year did. The fact that cost is playing an increasingly significant roll in enrollment patterns is supported by census data on median family income increases. (Author/LBH)",

This study shows the pattern of giving in 1973-74, focusing on contributions of individual donors, alumni, and nonalumni. Sample institutions were surveyed and the results indicate that voluntary individual gifts were made to the 988 reporting institutions in the aggregate amount of more than $830 million. The report demonstrates the importance of voluntary support, the dependence of higher education on the large gift, the importance of gifts of property, as well as other types of gifts, such as bequests, deferred contributions, and life-time gifts. The survey indicates that although total giving in 1973-74 is estimated to be the same as  in 1972-73, contributions from business, religious denominations, foundations, and other sources increased, while voluntary support from individual donors declined by six percent.

The focus of the study was on the informal working relationships that helped to resolve conflict either within or outside the contractual procedures. Although grievance procedures were studied and discussed, they were considered to provide only the framework within which the parties attempted to resolve their differences. Differences between a procedural grievance (charging that the administration failed to adhere to contractual procedures) and a substantive grievance (charging the administration with making an unjustifiable decision) were also an important aspect of the study. In  eight of the nine institutions studied, both management and labor representatives were interviewed and were allowed to pursue a wide variety of topics to determine the unique relationships existing at each institution. Topics included: representation on grievance committees; procedures; fair resolution; secretive vs. open processes; faculty and administrative reactions; union-faculty senate relationship; political considerations; institutional communication; multicampus grievance reviews; and consistency.

Major themes identified at the hearings are discussed.

The bureaucratic hurdles  are placed before those who have the least experience in dealing with such barriers to financial aid.

Education and training for employment has been identified as a special need for southern high school graduates. Postsecondary education must offer a broad range of opportunities for education beyond high school, and the full diversity of postsecondary institutions and programs must be considered in statewide planning for the effective use of public resources. The purpose and meaning of a baccalaureate education must be redefined, and undergraduate programs must be reexamined in terms of changing demands and expectations for education. Other priorities are identified for the  active consideration of academic and public leaders. Consolidation and restraint in development of graduate and professional education, the adequacy of funding, use of specialized talents and resources in the solution of societal problems, need for self-generated reform, more nontraditional approaches, and concern for minority and ethnic groups are matters requiring careful consideration by policy and decision makers.

Using the 1975 University Student Census, data were gathered on 1,532 incoming freshmen students at the University of Maryland, College Park. The original sample was categorized into students who expected to be living at home or with relatives (dependent commuter), students living off-campus apart from relatives (independent commuter),  and students living in residence halls, fraternities, or sororities. The general conclusion is that there are differences between resident and commuting students, but that commuters are not clearly disadvantaged. Subgroups of commuters differ more from one another than from resident students and should be considered a heterogeneous group. (Author/LBH)",

Enrollments are projected to 1990 for full-time and part-time students in three collegiate sectors. The projective methodology is a ratio technique that minimizes data requirements and eliminates the need for making subjective judgments. Projections indicate that: (1) the independent sector faces a serious enrollment problem in the future as the public sector continues to expand; (2) growth in all sectors will reach a peak between 1979-1982 and decline to 1990; and (3) some expansion is to be expected, particularly in the public two-year sector. Policy issues raised by these projections are: (1) whether present institutional capacities are  sufficient to deal with the peak enrollments projected; (2) whether it is efficient to expand those segments of the postsecondary system under its control while other segments deteriorate; (3) whether the relationship between projected educational cost increases for institutional and projected enrollments will contribute to a future revenue-expenditure gap; and (4) what assumptions about change seem reasonable, and what is desirable if these projections raise areas of concern.

The examples of good practice offered in each of these areas are neither required nor recommended.

Black representation varies widely among fields of study, ranging at the bachelor's level from 2 percent in architecture to 23 percent in social work. Black college graduates have the best employment prospects when two conditions coincide: (1) greater demand than supply, and (2) blacks are especially underrepresented in the field. Fields that meet both conditions include the health specialties, engineering, accounting, computer sciences, public administration, and urban and regional planning. Teacher education and most of the social sciences are fields that least meet these  two requirements and in which black graduates have the worst employment prospects. In 1974-75, 40 percent of all bachelor's and master's degrees earned by black students were in the field of teacher education, as compared to only 29 percent of all students. (Editor/LBH)",

After contrasting traditional and alternative forms of graduate education, recommendations are made that: (1) graduate institutions and departments should periodically redefine their goals and objectives and make them public; (2) graduate institutions should reexamine their policies and procedures so that they are consistent with their goals and objectives and so that they become more flexible and more responsive to both student and societal needs; (3) graduate faculties should expect to change their practices regularly to be responsive to what research evidence shows to be desirable with respect to teaching and learning; (4) graduate faculties  should reevaluate their systems so that the focus is on learning and the output product rather than grades, credits, and degrees; (5) graduate degree programs should contain a creative component that gives priority to student interests and needs as contrasted to institutional and/or professorial interests and needs; and (6) graduate education whether traditional or nontraditional should maintain a high quality standard for the levels of advancement and maturity that characterize graduate students. Experience suggests that the outlook for responsiveness to these and other recommendations is not optimistic. (Author/KE)",

Small private colleges with more limited curricular offerings in heavy competition for students are those using no-need awards most in an attempt to solve their problems of enrollment and academic stature. However, large public and private institutions are also using these kinds of awards to attract a cadre of outstanding students. The implications of such heavy competition for students are outlined. A discussion of the arguments pro and con on no-need awards is presented touching on such topics as: raising the academic profile of an institution; use as a cost discounting procedure; enrollment incentives and inducements; use as competitive enticement against low tuition  institutions; increased access to students; use as award for academic excellence; and the institution's right to financial independence and determination of priorities. The College Scholarship Service (CSS) policy statement on the use of no-need scholarships is included. The recommendation for adoption recognizes that such awards are ineffective in accomplishing their stated goals and that scarce institutional funds should be combined with increased state, federal, and institutional grant programs to enable needy students to choose freely among all postsecondary opportunities available to them.

The importance of packaging policies and procedures lies in the growing multiplicity of sources of aid and the fact that aid is different in kind. Equity packaging, the combination of self-help and nonself-help aid distributed equitably to similar students, is discussed in detail. The underlying principles for such a program are outlined as is the practical implementation. The packaging plan should determine the needs of the applicant  pool; the applicant's resources; what can be expected in terms of reasonable self-help; how much need remains; and how the remaining need should be met. One experimental use of equity packaging using the CSS Financial Aid Form (FAF) is outlined. (JMF)",

        "description":"The third national Course by Newspaper entitled \"American Issues Forum I: American Society in the Making\" was presented by the University Extension, University of California, San Diego starting in September 1975. A series of 18 articles appeared weekly in 432 newspapers. A total of 221 colleges and universities participated in the program, enrolling 3,956 students in the course for credit. Approximately four thousand additional persons bought the text used in the course but did not enroll. Impact of the course was measured by five studies: (1) 3,000 telephone interviews were completed with participating newspaper subscribers in eight geographic areas; (2) 500 interviews of subscribers to the San Diego \"Evening Tribune\" were conducted; (3) a mail survey was made of persons who  purchased the text used but who did not enroll in the course for credit; (4) a multiple-choice examination was given at the end of the course at the institutions affiliated with the program; and (5) a mail questionnaire survey was made of the opinions of instructors and course coordinators involved in the program. Profiles were developed on the age, sex, educational attainment, and other characteristics of newspaper subscribers, course enrollees, and book purchasers who did not seek college credit. These data were compared with similar data gathered on previous newspaper courses. (Author/JMF)",

This paper describes how a transactional system can be developed and operated for an office that has no computer support. The model is an Office of Institutional Research (OIR). The OIR manual (noncomputer supported) transactional system at Texas Southern University was developed to improve the internal management of the office. The office's major activities are monitored from initiation to completion through the three basic processes: coding, filing, and routing. The model is adaptable to almost any small office situation. It forces the user to spend a great deal of time logically analyzing the operations of his office and planning procedures designed to improve efficiency. (JMF)",

The system is essentially for a large university setting but could be adapted to other types of educational institutions. The section dealing with laws and orders regarding equal employment opportunity offers a modicum and synthesis of most of the mandates, executive orders, and acts that offer guidelines and pertinent information.

        "description":"Surveyed are undergraduate grading practices and their impact on graduate admissions. A diversity of reasons are offered by the respondent universities and institutes for the dramatic rise in undergraduate grade-point averages since the mid-1960's. These speculations focus on changes in student and faculty behavior, innovations in grading systems, and ancillary changes and influences. A derived grade-point index for respondent institutions shows a consistent increase since 1963. However, graphs reported undergraduate grade-point averages by student class level, freshman through senior, show a flattening of the curves, that is, a trend toward a slowing of the rise in grade-point average values. Plus and minus symbols or some alternate scheme for greater differentiation in grading  is used by roughly half of the respondent institutions. Important innovations in grading are pass/fail, credit/no credit, and withdrawal without penalty regulations for courses attempted and not completed or failed. The respondent institutions are not planning any major changes in their current grading systems. Statistics are presented along with a discussion of the data. (Author/KE)",

        "description":"A two-stage nationwide mail survey of medical school graduates of 1965 was designed to provide health planners with better and more current information on physician location determinants. Presented are the findings of that survey that specifically address the problems of identifying location decision factors that seem to differentiate physicians who choose a rural practice location from those who choose an urban one. The survey focuses attention on primary care physicians, acknowledges the potential importance of a complex of personal, professional, and social factors in the location decision, and investigates the role of the wife. Two surveys are reported. The initial survey of graduates of 1965 reaffirmed the importance of place of rearing in a physician's choice of practice  location. A follow-up survey designed to examine certain decision influences in detail revealed the incentives needed to attract physicians not only to a particular community, but to rural areas in general. Results indicate that, while rural physicians for the most part choose their location out of preference for rural as opposed to urban areas, the urban physicians in the sample base their choice as often as not on considerations independent of such a preference.

(2) The trends in state support for higher education institutions over the past few years have led to a decreased level of support in proportion to other states, and resulted in an increase in the amount and proportion of costs to the student. A continuation of these trends will result  in a further curtailment of programs and services, and continued increases in cost to the student at a disproportionate rate. (Author/LBH)",

Current conditions are described in terms of age composition, population mix, patterns of participation, and changing student interests. Future developments in enrollment patterns must consider economic conditions, a broader role for higher education, differential impact, and changes in the student population. It is concluded that (1) there is general agreement that colleges and universities can no  longer rely upon college attendance among 18-22-year-olds to achieve long-range growth, and (2) there is sufficient diversity in higher education to adjust to the needs of a society committed to providing all of its citizens with an opportunity to do their best.

Evaluation is defined as a process of review to assess the performance of academic administrators and to make a value judgment concerning this assessment. Such review involves the assessment of actual performance, management activity, quality of leadership, and other activities and attributes. The model makes use of an ad hoc evaluation committee that prepares an assessment portfolio. This portfolio contains a self-evaluation statement by the person under review, descriptive and evaluative statements representing the valid interests of various constituencies, and a consensus  statement as well as a dissenting or minority statement if any. The board of trustees reviews the assessment portfolio and makes its own definitive evaluation. The review is qualitative and judgmental, based on specific criteria.

Inflation is cited as the primary reason for the increases, which since 1966 have been higher than the rise in the Higher Education Price (HEP) Index constructed by Halstead. The figures indicate that within the last 11 years, state and land grant colleges and universities have been forced to rely to a greater extent on tuition and fees for  income because other sources have failed to match inflationary cost spirals. The rise in total charges in the last seven years has been approximately 50 percent.

No optimum standards were used in this survey. This attempt was merely to locate available programs and provide a beginning for further data gathering and information  activities.

Almost 90 percent of the freshman class was initially administered the survey during the pre-school Freshman Orientation Program. A sophomore year retest was given to 75 percent of the sample class, and the final retest was mailed to all former members of the class, with a 60 percent return. The following conclusions were drawn: (1) Females are important factors in the class response patterns, with their conservative opinions overshadowing the more radical and liberal male views. (2) There is a peak of liberalization of political philosophy that begins to ebb two years after matriculation. (3) By the final testing there is no  longer evident any automatic matching of political party, philosophy, and issue. (4) Males, in contrast to females, through the senior year of testing show a decrease in agreement with parents' political views. (5) There remains a strong, continuous conservative orientation in class responses. (6) Home and dormitory residents are more conservative in outlook than students living off-campus. (7) Curriculum major correlates with attitude, with liberal attitudes more evident among arts and science and business administration students. (Author/LBH)",

        "description":"Education continues to be blamed for many of society's ills and the liberal arts and the occupational training advocates continue to argue about which is more important. What is needed is a new perspective that focuses on education as the acquisition of basic and general skills rather than the acquisition of either knowledge per se or narrow technical skills alone. Skill is defined as the ability to use one's knowledge effectively and readily in execution or performance; career is defined as a course of continued progress, a profession, or calling. Their interrelationship is pyramidal, with skills leading toward careers. It is suggested that emphasis is needed on basic general skills, with efforts made to show students how these can be applied to certain career jobs in a  practical way. Experiential learning opportunities to supplement a student's academic work are advocated. An example of a liberal arts college offering a specialty in transportation planning and analysis is given, and recommended courses are listed. (LBH)",

A total of 143 (97 percent) of these individuals returned usable questionnaires containing data related to their career patterns as well as evaluative data that contributed to assessing the effectiveness of both the graduate assistantship program and the master's program in industrial education. Most of the respondents majored in industrial arts education while pursuing the bachelor's degree and entered the assistantship and master's programs with little or no teaching experience. Many gained prior work experience in industry. The evaluative data indicated that both programs generally met the needs  of and contributed to the career development of service assistants. The data also indicated that the primary goal of the master's program was to prepare individuals for teaching positions in industrial arts education. Respondents were generally satisfied with the course offerings, although service assistants also felt that more attention should be given to courses reflecting the broader aspects of industry and technology.

Such outreach methods may include teacher-student relationships, publishing, exhibits, cultural presentations, community forums, use of the electronic media, cooperation with  organizations and institutions, or merely people talking to people.

The overall testing program scheduled a sophomore and senior year retest after the freshman year data were collected. Statistics were gathered in the areas of: sex distribution; major; father's occupation; head of household's estimated annual income; parental educational background; geographical area of upbringing; student need to work for expenses; college board scores; high school class standing; agreement with parental political views; political philosophy; attitudes toward marijuana and heroin laws; personal drug usage; personal alcohol usage; and attitudes toward military draft. The general finding was that in its  first two years at Shippensburg the centennial class underwent a change process best described as &quot;conservative-liberalization.&quot; Liberal tendencies interacted within the context of persistent traditional values. The relatively large number of female students was still an effective conservative influence within the student body. The prime question for future consideration is what effect the final two years of college will have upon the entire spectrum of changes already noted in this report. (Author/LBH)",

The results indicate that almost half of the freshmen have a particular job in mind that motivates their college studies and are looking forward to full-time employment immediately after graduation. Over 80 percent want a freshmen or early sophomore year experience with specific courses in their major field of interest. Over one-third of the class believes the most realistic time to choose their major field of study is the first semester of their  sophomore year. Over 75 percent want special advisement to help choose their major, in addition to the usual student advisement program for declared majors. Additional analyses of possible relationships between varied background characteristics and the principle questions of this study were provided by the computer program on: income level, father's occupation, drug use, sex, grade-point average, and geographical area.

A review of the recommendations of these studies and reports and the implications of the new directions of science suggest that we need: (1) a locus of responsibility for making science information policy at the national level; (2) a dynamic, federally funded research and development program; and (3) a voluntary organizational mechanism for coordinating STI activities in the public and private sectors.  The office of the President's Science Advisor would be a natural home for (1) a Panel on Science Information Policy responsible for examining STI policy issues affecting the public and private sectors, and (2) an institute with which STI elements in the public and private sectors could voluntarily affiliate. The National Science Foundation's Division of Science Information should be charged with explicit national research and coordination responsibilities for STI, including explicit research priorities consistent with national priorities and the new directions of science.

Libraries and media centers should be called &quot;information centers&quot; to reflect the explosion of information which is outdating the traditional media. Plans are underway in the Virgin Islands to develop computer information links with the mainland United States and Puerto Rico. These links would have profound implications for such a geographically remote area. Current problems of librarians in Virgin Islands schools, however, have little to do with computers. The rote-learning curriculum and the frequent use of librarians as babysitters restrict the library's effectiveness. Rates of college failure among graduates of Virgin Islands schools and  the high dropout rate reflect the lack of orientation toward individual needs. Students should be liberated to explore and analyze in their own ways. The library can facilitate needed instructional individualization. Appendixes accompanying this speech include a record of the question answer period which followed. (KB)",

The program was used to provide mainline rather than supplemental instruction. Nine hundred and one students from nine school districts participated in the television-based program for two hours a day for 20 days. Three hundred and fifty matched control students were drawn from the same districts. Data were collected through criterion-referenced pretests, midtests, posttests, and retention tests developed from the cognitive objectives of the program. The mean test performance for experimental and control groups across test occasions  showed greater improvement for the experimental groups. Other statistical analyses showed reading and pretest scores to be significant in predicting posttest scores. The science and social studies areas of the program were influenced less by reading ability than other content areas. There was no relation shown between student liking or the program and student performance. (KB)",

In the late 1960's a balanced methodology was devised to evaluate doctoral programs in the School of Education at Indiana University. The model of doctoral education that emerged facilitated analysis, but it was contested by many faculty members. Students constituted the input and output variables in the model. The major process variables were stated as clusters of student activities while university resources constituted context variables. A statement of formal external criteria rather than substantive criteria was formulated that could be applied to all doctoral programs. Operational indicators of the criteria were enumerated by a  faculty committee. The initiation of formal program review utilizing the evaluation process guide was postponed for six years and is still in halting progress. The process of developing the guide, the guide itself, and the problems of implementation at Indiana University provide a history of a difficult undertaking which proved particularly susceptible to the effects of circumstance.

Teachers' reactions to the first year's experience were enthusiastic. Specific complaints were aimed at the level and limitations of the curriculum. Everyone agreed that the system was appropriate for the school population. The total cost of the system projected for five years was estimated at $180,000. Based on the first year's average of 1.7 hours of use per student per week, the average cost per student hour was $3.80. In the first year middle school  students averaged a 1.3 grade level gain in math and a .4 gain in reading. High school students showed a 1.1 grade level gain in math and 1.3 in reading. The dramatic story of one student's gains using the system added to the positive evaluation of the program. (KB)",

        "description":"Generalized computational subroutines can reduce programing repetitions and wasteful computer storage use. The most useful are those that are flexible enough to handle a wide variety of situations. Subroutines may have details open to change in order to blend into the main program. They may be built into the computer library or supplied by the programer as part of this program deck. Library subroutines have limiting specifications and ranges, entry and exit commands and addresses which should be designed to fit into any program. Operating routines, the most prominant type of which are the input-output sets or \"packages,\" differ from other subroutines in that they partially control the computer and return control to the main program when their work is completed. Basic subroutines  of particular value in a chemical library include basic arithmetic computations, function evaluations, numerical analyses plus collating and sorting programs. Service routines--compilers, assemblers, debugging and machine testing programs--are also useful. (KB)",

NHK derives its support from receiver fees. Under the 1950 Broadcast Law which established NHK as a public broadcasting organization the Prime Minister appoints NHK's Board of Governors and the National Diet approves its budget. The government is restrained under the law from interfering with programing, however. NHK broadcasting standards are supplemented by extensive public surveying in making programing determinations. News, educational, cultural and entertainment programs plus special documentaries are presented over NHK stations. NHK's overseas system broadcasts in 21 languages. The network operates a Radio and TV  Culture Research Institute and a Public Opinion Research Lab in addition to technical research division. Since 1972 NHK has had a budget deficit. New management techniques and higher fees have recently been instituted. Appendixes to the corporation report include public opinion data, technical descriptions, and a brief history of NHK. (KB)",

Stanford Achievement Test (SAT) results were used to check the achievement gains of students using the program. Twenty out of 28 lower elementary students achieved at least one grade level in math; eight achieved two years. Fifteen out of 33 upper elementary students demonstrated a one grade increase; eight out of 23 middle school students increased one grade or more. The lower achievement gains for middle school students were attributed to the  fact that most of them remained in mixed strand programs for most of the year and that their SAT level test scores may have been less valid.

Reciprocal borrowing privileges may change the library use patterns of patrons, increasing traffic in an especially convenient, or well-supplied library. A reciprocal return policy, allowing items borrowed in one library to be returned to another, requires additional space in member libraries for sorting and holding books and facilities for shipping them back to their owners. The creation of identical or compatible circulation systems for all member libraries can involve a complete change in policy for an individual library with accompanying changes in space requirements. If the system develops a  centralized circulation control system, most of the libraries will be relieved of various tasks and should be able to save some space, but the library housing the centralized operations will need greatly increased staff and space. Finally, should the system opt for an automated circulation system, substantial changes in service patterns and space needs can be expected by all member libraries. (PF)",

The experimental design used an experimental section in which the students had the opportunity to use the computer to the intensity of their choice, choosing from tutorial lessons, games, and simulations. The students in the control section received their instruction by the traditional lecture-textbook method. Students were not randomly assigned to individual sections, but rather they selected a given section primarily on the basis of scheduled class times. Each instructor's experimental section, however, was randomly assigned. Results showed that under virtually all the conditions studied, gains in educational output did not outweigh the additional cost of CAI. Only  when the costs of development of CAI materials was ignored did the CAI format appear marginally efficient. It was suggested that costs of CAI may be reduced when authors gain experience in writing CAI programs and that advances in computer technology may have an impact on CAI costs. (JY)",

Four models were abstracted from the data. Model A organizations provide information through cataloging existing audiovisual materials. Its members obtain materials from different producers. Model B organizations stock and distribute materials which are purchased or produced by its members. Members of Model C determine their audiovisual materials policies  collectively. Model D pursues the objective of pooling or common creation of production tools. The structures, implementation strategies, and problems confronted by exchange mechanisms are functions of their objectives. Problems can be overcome through clear specification of goals by the concerned countries or agencies with the coordinating or financing organization. Implementation generalizations drawn from current experiences suggest that it is better to progressively amplify existing mechanisms as needs and desires for cooperation evolve rather than create a complex exchange mechanism all at once.

A committee of representative faculty and staff had responsibility for planning, program development and evaluation procedures. A Computer Based Education Laboratory was established with terminals hardwired to the central university computing system. To stimulate faculty interest and development, a survey to solicit expressions of interest was conducted, followed by workshops in instructional technology and computer-assisted instruction (CAI). There has been a continual increase in the use of the computer system by both  undergraduates and graduate students. Student and faculty materials development has remained fairly constant. In attitude surveys students agreed that the computer is a useful instructional tool. Evaluation of cognitive gains by student users showed learning was facilitated by the CAI modules. Future plans include continuing support for faculty development, distribution of products and continued evaluation of results. (KB)",

The use of games for education was borrowed from the business community, which in turn had borrowed the idea from the military. Educational games include several distinct types--simulations, role playing, games and simulation games. Two general classes of classroom games have been developed. The first teaches specific skills and subject content; the second presents moral and social concepts. Games generate student enthusiasm and involvement. They encourage interaction among students. Disadvantages include their high cost and limited availability and their simplistic structuring of reality. The design of educational games involves several distinct steps. The first and  most important is the specification of the game's objectives. The determination of a model appropriate to the objectives follows. Evaluation of games should test the game's validity and coverage and two aspects of comprehension--the students' understanding of both the game and the real world subject of the game.

Two aspects of the facilitator's role were identified for evaluation: (1) whether the facilitator had implemented the strategy it established to pursue its functions and (2) whether that strategy was successfully meeting the needs of its recipients. Interviews were conducted with a sample of representatives of developer/demonstrator projects and school site adopters. The four national developer/demonstrators interviewed were generally approving of the Pennsylvania Facilitator. They reported the state strategies acceptable in terms of the broader  National Diffusion Network (NDN) but recommended changes in the philosophy of the NDN which would expand the responsibilities of the facilitator program. Nine representatives of adopter/adapter districts were interviewed. The concensus of their opinions was positive. The lack of a real grasp of the specific role of the State Facilitator by this group mitigated against an in-depth analysis or specific recommendations for change. (KB)",

Adult library use generally declines under such arrangements. Inequity of support for various geographical areas could result. In addition, legal questions concerning the use of school collections by nonpublic school students have not been resolved. Experience in Wisconsin and literature reports do not show that such consolidations save money. In determining their policy position, the agencies considered a list of questions concerning facilities, staffing, decision-making authority, financing, collection, and administration which might indicate the feasibility of consolidation. Single paragraph descriptions of the  three existing Wisconsin consolidated libraries and an 18-reference bibliography are appended. (KB)",

A curriculum guide which considered the coordination issues of timing, sequence and context was developed. The &quot;World Food Crisis&quot; program received the support of the Carnegie Foundation supported Change in Liberal Arts Education Project. It was aimed at the liberal arts student seeking a broad understanding of contemporary social issues. The students who participated  were older, on the average, than the traditional student at Mendocino. Many of them were actively involved in &quot;back-to-earth&quot; movements. The program proved as cost-beneficial as the rest of the college's activity in terms of weekly student and faculty contact hours. Pretest and posttest measures of personal growth in a &quot;value-added&quot; measurement revealed that program students made significant gains.

Circulation of these materials was often restricted, however. A number of progressive librarians stressed the acceptance of nonprinted materials as complementary to the book medium to the library function. Films were not usually included in these early media collections. The American Library Association (ALA) recognized the importance of film quite early. Audiovisual librarianship was introduced to the ALA structure by 1924. A number of programs were sponsored by the association to attract interested librarians, but many of the ALA recommendations for expanded library utilization of the new medium were not implemented. By the 1940's,  committed staff and funds were available to the ALA to conduct a number of studies of the use of film and to establish working committees within the organization.

The Trainer-Tester device presented the student with a list of the symptoms exhibited by a malfunctioning piece of equipment and required him to conduct a number of hypothetical tests and measures until he could determine the cause of the malfunction. The Punchboard Tutor device provided students with immediate correction of  multiple choice questions. The performance of the three groups on examinations, laboratory grades, and overall performance was compared. Follow-up data on those trainees who went from the Basic Electronics course into Advanced Radar and Communication Schools was obtained. Students who used the training devices received higher overall grades than students who used equipment only.

These devices can be more useful than their operational equipment counterparts because they facilitate the focusing of learner attention on particular components of a total operation, they make operations visible for study, and they provide opportunity for ample student practice within allowable budgets. Design of these devices should begin from an analysis of performance objectives, the skills needed to meet them, and the characteristics of the trainees. Various training devices are particularly suited to the teaching of identification, facts and relationships, principles, sequential or variable procedures, diagnostic or motor skills. Classroom  instructors may employ visual aids to assist them in their training functions. Use of mock-ups, animated wall displays, transparencies, wall charts and films should be aimed at motivating students and maximizing their personal response to the instruction.

Two matched groups of Air Force pilots were pretested on their knowledge of instrument flying information. The device was then installed in the crew lounge of one of the groups. No device was available to the other group. After a two month period both groups were posttested.

Also surveyed were first-level supervisors' beliefs of their subordinates' perceptions of organizational climate. A sample of 150 college personnel was surveyed using the Likert Profile of Organizational Climate, Form T. A response rate of 63.3% was achieved. It was found that perceptions and expectations between groups varied, and that overall, perceptions of organizational climate were incongruent. Professional personnel and faculty perceived the organization to be more Benevolent Authoritative than did the other groups who  perceived the organization to be more Consultative. All of the groups held expectations that, for the future, the organization would become more Participative. As a result of the study, it was recommended that a series of Organizational Development interventions be planned as a way of managing change to reduce the degree of incongruency of perceptions. Also recommended was periodic testing of the organizational climate. The survey instrument and references are appended. (Author/JDS)",

        "description":"This document is the final report of the Instruction Committee of the Diablo Valley College (DVC) Faculty Senate on a two-phase study conducted to determine attitudes and practices relating to final examinations both at DVC and at community colleges throughout California. Phase one involved 275 DVC faculty in a survey of DVC Faculty Practice and Perceptions of Final Examinations. Phase two involved 98 Deans of Instruction in California community colleges in a Statewide Survey of Community College Final Examination Policies and Procedures. In both phases of the study, questionnaires were utilized; a 45% response rate in phase one and an 82.7% response rate in phase two were achieved. The majority of DVC faculty appeared satisfied with current final examination schedules and  procedures although there was some notable dissent. Faculty comments on final examinations, pro and con, are included in the report. Phase two results indicated that conditions essentially similar to those at DVC exist throughout California community colleges. Dissent on the issue of final examinations was also similar to that at DVC and selected comments are included in the report. Although the problem of how best to evaluate students seems universal, consensus seems to favor some form of regular testing of student academic achievement. This report presents some alternatives and modifications recommended by the respondents. Survey instruments and summary data are attached. (JDS)",

Of those surveyed, 54 usable responses were obtained. Among the findings were: the average salary was $12,393 for a 9 to 10 month year; 47 respondents were employed full-time; 22 held M. A.'s in journalism or communications, 25 held M. A.'s in other fields, 1 held a Ph.D., and 6 had B.

The program seeks not only to broaden the experience of the individual intern, but to promote empathy among faculty and administration, and to develop a pool of administrative talent for the college. Admission to Phase I of the two-phase internship program is accomplished by means of application and approval by a Board of Control. Upon approval, the intern is assigned to a mentor, who, with the intern, develops the individual intern program. Periodic meetings are held to discuss problems, progress, and experiences. Narrative reports are filed by  parties to the internship at its end, and are filed in the intern's personnel file. Phase I internships are limited to four interns at a time, and may extend from two to four quarters at a minimum of one hour per day. Phase II operates similarly, but seeks to provide in-depth administrative experience and involves high priority administrative responsibilities. A specified amount of released time may be arranged for Phase II activities, and successful completion is recognized by the college as administrative experience for employment purposes.

Part 2, Program Evaluation: Quantitative Methods, discusses human and theoretical problems with quantitative data, defines levels of measurement, and illustrates sample objectives measured at different levels. Part 3, Introduction to Attitudes and Attitude Measurement, defines attitudes and their cognitive, affective, and behavioral  components, discusses functions of attitudes and a rationale for their measurement, describes characteristics of attitudes and behavior, and provides guidelines for measuring attitudes through use of examples. A general discussion of attitude measurement and the expected value to educators is included in this part. Part 4, Evaluation of Support Department Objectives, discusses objective formulation, emphasizing the writing of measurable objectives that are realistic, attainable, and focused on results.

For the past year, Hagerstown Junior College (Maryland) has been operating an Instructional Clinic (IC) designed to be congruent with the needs of faculty and staff and drawing upon resources which already exist within the college. The IC is systematic and outcome oriented. It begins by analyzing concerns expressed by members of the college community. Assistance in meeting the concerns is drawn from the expertise possessed by other members of the community. In 1975-76, the IC met 14 times and approximately one-half of the staff attended at  least one clinic. Nine issues were analyzed and consensus mandated continuing the process in 1976-77. Among the results produced by the IC in its first year were: development of a readability index for application to all text materials, design of an item analysis model to assess test validity, development of computerized reliability testing, development of audio-tutorial modules explaining term paper preparation, and development of a video-tape instructional evaluation model. The IC is capable of resolving problems inherent in externally based staff development. (Author/JDS)",

The study also assessed faculty, staff, and administration perceptions of student views relative to these matters. Survey forms were filled out by 34.2% (175) of the student body and by 51.4% (37) of the faculty, staff, and administration. Data analysis revealed the student sample to be non-random; weighting of responses was consequently employed and data was analyzed using the Chi-square test. A demographic profile of the student body was developed and is reported herein. Perceptions of CEU counseling, instruction and instructors, the learning  assistance center, administrative/student relations, student activities, and facilities were obtained. While analysis revealed few differences in student perception according to age, grade point average, or class standing, a general discrepancy was found to exist in most areas between student views and faculty-staff perceptions of these views. It was concluded that faculty, staff, and administration need to be more aware of student feeling. The survey instrument is appended. (Author/JDS)",

LAMC has chosen a structure stemming from the cluster concept, involving semi-autonomous clusters, each small in size. These characteristics enhance student-faculty-administrator relations and permit each instructional unit to participate directly in its own evolution. At the same time, some services are centrally provided, thereby reducing costs by eliminating unnecessary duplication. LAMC's clusters will contain approximately 1,000 FTE students and 30 FTE faculty, organized around instructional programs, yet as educationally comprehensive as possible. Each cluster will have its own student government, with student activities emanating from the cluster. LAMC is functionally organized in three  tiers: the office of the president, the office of the dean of the college, and the clusters. Policy formulation and implementation flow through a system of councils (administrative, academic, and student) and the three-tier structure. The LAMC plan is compared in detail to those at five other cluster community colleges in California. Organization charts, curricula, administrative salaries, and other statistical comparisons for the five colleges are presented in appendices. (Author/JDS)",

        "description":"The central topic of this paper is the financing of adult education in Oregon. Participation by adults in postsecondary education has increased in recent years and will continue to increase as the result of demographic trends, labor market requirements, and personal desires for life enrichment. Oregon has made a significant commitment to adult education, but short range fiscal considerations threaten a reduction in adult education offerings in community colleges. Although Oregon has a distinctive postsecondary education record, it lags behind other states in its per-student appropriation of state and local taxes for higher education. Studies indicate that adults desire vocationally related courses, and, although costly, these can be financed if the state encourages community  colleges to offer those educational services not available elsewhere. State control of overall FTE (full-time equivalent) funding of community colleges rather than course-by-course reimbursement approval is the best financing system; it allows the community colleges to retain their flexibility, responsiveness to community needs, and innovative ability. Overall funding limits should be set by the state, but individual community colleges should be able to expend funds according to the needs identified in their individual communities. (Author/JDS)",

Subjects were students at Blue Ridge Community College enrolled in English 101, 102, 111, 112, and Psychology 201, 202, or 203 during one academic year. The NDRT (Form A) was administered to students in each of the seven courses who were present on the day of administration. At the conclusion of each academic quarter, final grades were assembled. Means and standard deviations of the NDRT and final grades were computed as were product-moment correlations between NDRT scores and grades. Results indicated that NDRT Raw Vocabulary and Raw Comprehension scores correlated positively with final grades. Correlations were  generally higher for Psychology than English. This difference may be accounted for by the fact that Psychology places greater reliance on reading than does English. These results indicated that NDRT scores predict course grades to the extent that course content is gleaned by reading. NDRT Rate scores do not serve as good predictors. Study data is presented in tabular form. (Author/JDS)",

Components of the plan for faculty include: evaluation by students, evaluation by supervisor, and evaluation of non-instructional activities (student advisement, committee work). In addition, each faculty member annually submits, after consultation, an Individual Professional Development Plan, specifying short- and long-range goals and means to attain them, and is thereafter evaluated on progress made  toward goal completion. Administrative staff and counselors use a similar approach to professional development activity. Secretarial personnel have a Professional Standard Program which involves course work, workshops, work experience, and testing. Plant maintenance personnel have a system of professional development which includes course work, literature distribution and review, workshops, and evaluation checklists. Part-time faculty are individually oriented and attend teaching skill development workshops. The plan is intended to be flexible and responsive to changing college conditions.

        "description":"A study was conducted at Cerritos College (California) to determine the effects on classroom learning of instructional innovations developed as a consequence of released time grants, and to determine if released time grants for program development in the college's Social Sciences Division should be continued in light of a 50% decline in grant applications. Analyses of performance and retention rates for multimedia and individualized courses developed under the grant program and traditional sections of the courses were inconclusive. A survey of division faculty revealed that, although a great majority felt the grants were a sound investment, two-thirds had never applied for a grant due to perceived administrative encumbrances or unwillingness to be held responsible for results.  Only 40% indicated they would consider applying if more assistance were given by the division chairman. A survey of eight other division chairmen found that six chairmen felt their divisions were still actively participating in the grant program, but five reported the same applicants constantly re-applying. Half claimed considerable counseling of applicants. On the basis of the findings, recommendations are made for improvements in grant program policies and procedures. (BB)",

        "description":"Fluctuations in financial and enrollment conditions have caused the faculty at Cerritos College (California) to be periodically subjected to intense pressure and to be held responsible for high student withdrawal rates, alternating with periods of administrative indifference. Concomitantly, college policy on non-punitive student course withdrawal has been either rigid or liberal. This study sought to determine if a defined policy on acceptable retention and withdrawal rates should be instituted, in light of data received from students about their reasons for withdrawing from college. Questionnaires were mailed to 3,866 students who had withdrawn in fall 1974; 965 (25%) were returned. Results indicated that employment necessities, financial problems, and job conflicts were the  major determinants of withdrawal. Personal and health problems were also major factors. A great deal of variation in reasons for withdrawal was found, and in many cases the interaction of several factors was responsible. It was also found that 34% of those who had withdrawn re-enrolled the following spring, and that only 10% did not plan on enrolling in the future. No formal policy on student withdrawal was suggested based on the findings, but written guidelines relating to withdrawal were recommended for counseling and instructional staff. (BB)",

Many community colleges emphasize the vocational area in the funding of new cooperative education programs; it is equally important for liberal arts students to experience the learning situation of work related to college study. The Napa College Work Experience program sets measurable learning objectives for the student at the beginning of the work experience, in terms of skill development, increased knowledge, and attitudes and motivations.  Results of this procedure have been favorably received by students, employers and the college. Other features of Napa's Work Experience program are detailed. The proposal that cooperative education continue to be an approved course of study for veterans is presented, and recommendations for action by educators and by the Veterans Administration are suggested.

Data for the present study were obtained from those four-year institutions which received transfer students during the summer and fall of 1975. Results indicated that transfers totalled 4,278, up from 4,001 the previous year. State-related institutions received the most transfers, although 13% less than the previous year. A 23% increase was noted in state-owned institutions, while the private sector had an increase of 38%. Overall, in the five years the community college transfer data has been analyzed, the number of transfers has almost doubled. Yet, the impact of the expanding network of community colleges accounts for  only one-fourth of the total interinstitutional student migration in Pennsylvania higher education. Recommendations made as a result of the study were: (1) a reporting system between transmitting and receiving institutions should be arranged in order that community colleges can follow their graduates to identify and resolve articulation difficulties; (2) information on reasons for student choice of institutions should be obtained for planning purposes; and (3) a future study should focus on articulation difficulties associated with the type of degree awarded.

Three points of view seem most common: veterans do more poorly than other students; veterans do better than other students; and, veterans do not differ from other students. This study investigated the academic achievement of veterans at North Hennepin Community College. All veterans who had enrolled during the academic years 1972-73 through 1974-75 were included in the study. A record was made of credits, honor points, credit hours of non-credit-bearing grades, age, and graduation status. Veterans were found to account for about 18% of the total yearly headcount of students and about 18% of the total credit hour generation. No significant differences were found between  veterans and non-veterans in average credit hour loads, grade point averages, or credit-course completion rates. In the three years studied, 70% of the veteran students persisted through all three quarters, a persistence rate felt to be not less than that of non-veteran students. The most compelling conclusion is that veterans do not differ from non-veterans in terms of academic achievement. (Author/JDS)",

This document results from recognition of these factors by William Penn College, a private institution, and Indian Hills Community College, and sets forth the terms and conditions of an articulation agreement designed to (1) identify specific interinstitutional areas of agreement; (2) set forth the criteria for transferring associate degrees as the first  two-year component of the baccalaureate degree; (3) provide for continuous evaluation and review of programs, policies, procedures, and relationships affecting interinstitutional student transfer; (4) recognize those vocational-technical programs which can be articulated into the baccalaureate degree; and (5) recommend revisions, as necessary, to promote the success and general well-being of the students served by the parties to the agreement.

Its curriculum is comprehensive; in addition to regular courses offered in a variety  of settings, students have opportunities to participate in independent study, cooperative and work study programs, and on-the-job training. The faculty of CCC are presently drawn from other district and area colleges, and from the community, and are hired on a part-time basis.

Active involvement of college personnel and community residents in the design, conduct, and decision-making stages of the assessment is explained as being essential to the assessment process. An eclectic approach to techniques for assessing needs is urged. Among the data that should be obtained from an assessment should be: population demographics, educational achievements and needs  inventory, a picture of institutions and groups with power to affect the quantity and quality of the interaction between the college and the community, and strategies for incorporating the above into an on-going process of interaction. Specific techniques in addition to survey research are listed for consideration in the performance of a needs assessment.

To date, 39 states have released guidelines or policies regulating the transfer of credit between two- and four-year colleges, and in some cases, procedures directing the articulation of curricula. Of the 39 state documents, 14 contain specifically drawn policies and 13 others are primarily made up of general guidelines. Most of the other 12 states rely almost entirely on interinstitutional agreements, but have also identified a state agency with some degree of statewide responsibility. In these 12 states, including the District of Columbia, statewide guidelines or  policies are in the planning process. The final section of this document summarizes the articulation/transfer scene. Articulation/transfer policy agreements should continue to be voluntary. While the need for statewide guidelines and coordination is recognized, authority for policy determination should rest with institutions, although cooperative responsibility between institutions and state agencies is important in the formulation of interinstitutional policies and procedures on articulation/transfer.

While there appears to be a proliferation of new individualized methods and procedures, they have existed in several forms in the past and have been utilized on a large scale, international in dimension. Although individualized systems are designed to provide opportunities for self-pacing by students, critics have charged that this method results in the devolution of teachers to mechanics and trainers. Individualized instruction is further criticized for its lack of opportunity for group interaction and for its lack of flexibility, as the planned curriculum has been broken down into multiple subunits, each  requiring the student's attention, regardless of his needs. Individualized systems seem to promote linearity, continuity, and insularity where some argue that a more holistic and synthesized approach would be more appropriate. Demands for accountability will continue for some time and individualized systems lend themselves to objective evaluation of student learning, albeit the subjective is often ignored. Scrutiny and criticism of the individualized approach should be continued. Concomitantly, the most creative approaches possible within the scope of individualized instruction should be sought.

Analysis of academic records revealed that the mean scholastic average of on-campus students was not higher than the average for those off campus, and that attrition and probation rates were not lower for campus residents. In light of these findings, it was recommended that the policy of York College requiring all freshmen to live on campus as an aid to scholastic achievement not be reinstated. Rather, it was suggested that those freshmen  wishing to live off campus be released, replacing them with upperclassmen wishing to live on campus. (Author/JDS)",

Among the findings discussed are: a consensus was emerging on the goal of the community college, &quot;to provide some form of education for any student regardless of academic ability&quot;; guidance and counseling and innovation in programs were viewed as having a high priority level under both ample and stringent budgetary conditions, while continuing  education had a relatively low institutional priority; state control was seen as becoming a more important factor in institutional operation with potential impact on institutional mission; the role of the president was seen as that of leader, decision-maker, and coordinator; and pressures for educational opportunity, job training/retraining, more leisure time, rising operational costs, and competition for resources were viewed as factors affecting the future of the community college.

All entering students scoring below the 20th percentile on the reading section of the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills are advised to enter a program named Project II, a block scheduled program containing two credit courses and two noncredit remedial reading and writing courses. Students who have been away from school, or whose academic preparation is weak, have an option to enter the Cooperative Learning Program, a two-semester program offering courses from almost all curricular areas of the college as well as training in study skills, career information sessions, and tutoring. Counselors are attached to the programs  to follow up on students, providing assistance as necessary. Some data on these programs already indicate success: retention rate for the Cooperative Learning Program was 91% compared to 67% for the college overall, and over 50% of the students enrolled in the program advanced to sophomore status after one year while only 15 to 25% of the general college freshmen did so. A discussion of the tutoring component of the program and the services of the Learning Laboratory is presented, as is a brief discussion of future institutional responses to nontraditional students.

        "description":"Wholesome and promising change is occurring in American education, with interest in adult educational opportunities expanding in impressive proportions. Yet a kind of riptide exists between the interest in lifelong learning and the apparently limited financial resources available for conventional education for transitional students. On what basis should priorities be set? How should public resources be deployed? Agreement is needed on a sense of direction for education. The goal that every individual should have the opportunity for appropriate education up to the limits of his or her potential should be re-examined to determine whether it should be amended or modified. Assessments of community educational needs, with broad involvement of the citizenry, would aid in the goal  clarification process. Studies are needed that would result in: (1) a better and wider understanding of the rapidly changing characteristics of educational consumers; (2) an awareness of the diversity of institutions; (3) a statement of goals and perspectives; (4) a proposed policy framework to encourage desirable diversity and institutional initiative and adaptability; (5) alternative ways of demonstrating accountability; (6) encouragement of voluntary cooperation among institutions with common interests. America has unusual opportunities to build an education system more and more interfused with life's other meaningful activities. (Author/JDS)",

Planning is defined as that institutional process by which the college establishes its mission and its derivative goals and objectives; management in the PME context addresses those policies and operating decisions which enable the college to achieve its objectives; and evaluation is concerned with determining the actual performance of the institution as weighed against the intended outcomes. The body of this manual consists of a presentation and discussion of PME  techniques. Among them are Planning, Programming and Budgeting (PPB), Management by Objectives (MBO), Management Information Systems (MIS), and Transaction Information Systems (TIS). Although PME application varies situationally from one institution to another, the final section of this manual describes generally appropriate considerations for implementation of PME.

        "description":"While the values derived from institutional self-evaluation efforts are fairly well understood, external evaluation is an important process in aiding an institution in the achievement of its goals; it supplements and complements, but does not supplant self-evaluation. Common functions of the external evaluation component of the Advanced Institutional Development (AID) Program include: (1) determining the extent to which the college has developed a continuing internal evaluation system, encompassing its total operations and internal constituencies; (2) examining relationships between institutional goals, mission, and AID Program activity objectives; and (3) determination of adequacy of procedures and processes employed for periodic re-examination of goals and mission,  effectiveness assessment, communication of evaluation information, and use of evaluation information in planning. It is not a function of external evaluation to render judgements about the quality or substance of the institution's goals or mission or to render opinions on funding or non-funding of specific activities. The external evaluator's qualifications should include: familiarity with the AID Program, AID monitoring and evaluation concepts, forms, and processes; access to varying expertise needed to evaluate outcomes of the institution's activities; and a background in higher education evaluation.

This relationship has been marked by antagonism, jealousies, and general substantial conflict since the l920's--first, over the establishment of vocational programs in junior colleges, and second, over junior college efforts to obtain legislative endorsement and state support. Underlying the conflict were opposing views of the purpose of higher education: the development of intellectual power apart from society (rationalistic-academic) or the preparation of workers for society (utilitarian-democratic). The consequence of this conflict has been the mobilization and increased cohesion of the junior college advocates, the development of a  junior college rhetoric, and finally the development of an identity for the community junior college based on the very characteristics of which university critics have been junior college and its graduates, universities remain skeptical of this younger institution's worth. For the community junior college, this skepticism may be a blessing in disguise. (BB)",

Data for analysis was obtained as a result of the administration of the Adult form of the Nowicki-Strickland Internal-External (ANS-IE) Opinion Survey. Because of the limited response rates of certain study sub-groups, generalizations could be made only with regard to CFCC professional personnel (N=37) and high-risk students (N=40). Results of the study indicated that CFCC professional personnel had considerably higher  internal locus of control orientation than did the total sample of high-risk students. Further, CFCC personnel had higher internal locus of control scores than did all student respondents. Communication of the concept of locus of control to college professional personnel and utilization of techniques designed to facilitate student development of internal locus of control orientation were recommended.

Responses were scored using a modified Likert Scale. Results of the analysis indicated that the majority of respondents felt their role in governance was almost non-existent. Most agreed that their role in decision-making was not what it should be ideally, but that it was what could realistically be expected.

Factor analysis and Pearson product-moment correlation statistical procedures were utilized in the data analysis. It was concluded that the socialization experiences and educational orientations assessed in this study (and generally used by administrators in faculty selection) are not appropriate as objective criteria for predicting teacher effectiveness in the community college.

The Tennessee Self Concept Scale was administered to the 11 students enrolled in the class at the outset and the conclusion of the semester. Actual growth in self concept was calculated by subtracting the pre-test score from the post-test score with the extent of the student's self concept change rated as a percent of the actual growth score in relation to potential growth. Analysis of the data revealed the percent  of growth in self concept of the study subjects ranged from -1 to 57. Student grade point averages (GPA) were also used in the evaluation: five students showed a decline in GPA compared to the previous semester, three an increase, and for the remaining three there were no comparable data. It was concluded that growth in self concept was achieved but was not always directly reflected in student GPA. When other variables such as course loads and persistence are considered, a growth relationship can be seen. (JDS)",

Its elements are: (1) an introduction and orientation to the community college and the role of the instructor therein; (2) the teaching-learning interface which includes analysis of learning behavior, cognitive style, the community college  student, and characteristics of the effective instructor; (3) teaching strategies for large and small groups, and individuals; (4) instructional aids and their use; (5) instructional evaluation, testing, and grading; and (6) planning for instruction, including lesson planning, task description, and lesson preparation. Performance objectives, instructional materials (audiovisual equipment and materials, handouts), and instructional suggestions are given for each workshop topic. An appendix lists the instructional materials for the entire curriculum by type. (JDS)",

Analysis of the records of 9l Independent Study enrollees in the fall, spring, interim, and summer semester of the 1974-75 school year indicated that 54% had completed the course (48% in one semester), 40% continued their project into the fall, 1975 semester, and 7% withdrew. The students represented 13 curricular areas of the college and their study topics reflected this wide variation; 19% were psychology majors, 14% were pre-education majors, 16% were undecided, and the remainder were equally  distributed among other transfer program areas. Continuation of the Independent Study course is recommended, but some constraints on completion time should be implemented, while the maximum allowable amount of credit should be increased. Extension of the course to include vocational students should be considered. (BB)",

        "description":"To examine the differences between mother-child interaction in middle class and in isolated rural poor families, a sample of 24 rural poor and 12 middle class mothers were videotaped as they interacted with their preschool children in structured situations. (Rural poor mothers were found to initiate verbal interaction with a question, a situation that exerts more press on the child to respond as vs. an information-providing situation which offers the child an opportunity to respond without pressing him.) As a result of the taped observations, a home teaching program was developed to improve the informational resources and verbal interaction of rural poor mothers with their children. The home-teaching program centered on changing rural poor mothers' strategies for interacting with  their children from a question-asking to an information-providing strategy through a series of 16 weekly one hour visits to 12 rural poor mothers' homes. During these visits, the home visitor worked with the mother and her preschool children demonstrating a variety of play activities which focused on the development of language skills and better mother-child communication. The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test and the Wechsler Pre-school and Primary Scale of Intelligence were administered to children before and after the program. Significant results (average of 7.37 points higher than pre-test scores t=2.15, p< .05 for children who participated in program) were found for the verbal scale of the Wechsler test. (SB)",

The purpose of the project was to determine the strengths in poverty situations which should be capitalized on in developing educational programs and to learn more about children's coping and adaptive mechanisms in general. A total of 143 low income black children served as subjects in the pilot study. The Stanford-Binet was administered to each child. The attitudinal variables of need for achievement, delay of gratification, reflectivity and internal-external control were assessed using individually administered tests and an experimental choice situation. Behavioral adjustment  was measured through behavior ratings by classroom teachers. Results indicated that the measure of need achievement showed no relationship to other attitudinal variables, behavioral adjustment, chronological age, or mental age. The motor inhibition test of impulsivity was significantly related to mental age, but showed no relationship to chronological age, behavioral adjustment, or the measures of attitudinal development. The negative internal control subscale was associated with chronological age only. No significant relationships were found for the positive internal control dimensions or delay of gratification.

Study findings tended to support the critical importance of stability and continuity in the people  giving care to babies outside the home. Entry into day care at a younger age and a shorter daily separation are indicated as factors which may facilitate the baby's daily adjustment to day care. (MS)",

Both cognitive functioning and social behavioral adjustment were explored. The central focus was on attitudes conducive to achievement which The Demonstration and Research Center for Early Education (DARCEE) preschool program sought to develop -- motivation to achieve, ability to delay gratification, reflection, and the related construct of internal-external control. Subjects were 143 low-income black children and their families who had been associated with the DARCEE Intrafamily Study. Results showed that the strongest differences in favor of the target groups involved in the preschool program were on the measure of negative internal-external control. For the younger  siblings, expected differences in favor of groups with maternal involvement were found only on the measure of behavior adjustment. The results of analyses investigating the relationships among these attitudinal variables indicated a considerable degree of situational specificity. Very few relationships reached statistical significance at or beyond the .05 level. Most conspicuous was the lack of significant relationship between these indices and ratings of behavioral adjustments in the school. Findings suggest that the view of these traits as highly generalized dispositions of the &quot;component self&quot; is an oversimplification. Appendices include the Internal-External Control Scale.

One method was direct training of a specific strategy, employing instructions, fading, modeling, and prompts to direct the child's attention to the relevant features and to organize systematic looking behavior. The second method involved the design of the stimuli, making relevant features perceptually more (or less) salient. Observing behavior and short-term recognition were studied. Sixty 3 1/2-to-5 1/2-year-old children matched pictures from memory with either strategy training for systematic scanning or placebo practice followed by transfer. One-third of the subjects in each condition saw stimuli with relevant portions made perceptually salient,  another third with irrelevant portions salient, and the rest with no portions salient. Strategy training enhanced systematic relevant observing behavior and facilitated recognition in both training and transfer. Stimulus saliency, when irrelevant, interfered in training for placebo subjects. Saliency directly influenced looking behavior only for young subjects in the early part of each trial. (Author/SB)",

Six babies (mean age 4.8 months when the study began) and their caregivers were observed in seven sequences of observations over a total span of 10 months. Each sequence of observations took place on six days during a 2-week period. In the last month of observation two babies had left the nursery, reducing the sample to four. The observational method used for collecting data was basically an event sampling procedure. For each distress episode, the observer recorded the baby's name, the nature of the distress (fuss, cry or scream), the name of the caregiver who intervened and the specific actions she took to soothe the infant (from a behavior list), and  when the distress had ceased for as long as thirty seconds (the end of that episode). The list of caregiver behaviors was based on pilot observations indicating which caregiver behaviors were most likely to occur when a baby showed distress. Results are discussed for the frequency and duration of fussing, crying, and mixed distress episodes, and for caregiver latency of response, nature of initial response, number of interventions, and order of appearance of caregiver responses within a single intervention.

Reference is made to the Family Problem Scale (Ernhart and Loevinger) which provides a psychological characterization of social class levels on five dimensions or subscales: authoritarian family ideology, approval of conventional social role for women, denial of hostility, concern for moralistic control, basic distrust vs. trust. Ten other subscales were created by imposing a priori constructs on items of the Family Problem Scale. These &quot;a priori scales&quot; are: old vs. new child rearing ideologies, mother's view of sex role, toilet training attitude, mother's house cleaning attitude, resentfulness, open vs.  enclosed family, affirmation vs. denial of aggression, autonomy vs. dependence, subscales of autonomy and sex role attitudes, attitudes towards pregnancy. In this report, preliminary ideas are given as to how the a priori scales might be related to social class levels or within them to variables like racial groupings and different-sized families. The a priori scales are included in an appendix. (JH)",

Three studies were made with 44 infants, aged 12 to 13 months. The first study, &quot;Aspects of Mastery Motivation and Cognitive Functioning,&quot; utilized structured situations in which infants could indicate their mastery motivation through persistent task-directed behaviors. Scoring of the tasks resulted in a three-part classification of mastery motivation behavior into effectance production, mastery of an emerging skill, and attempts to solve difficult problems. Infants' cognitive ability was measured and an interdependence of cognition and motivation was indicated. The second study, &quot;Mastery Motivation and Free Play  Behavior,&quot; was based on data from 41 of the 44 subjects. Findings suggested that measures of the quality of exploratory play, but not the quantity, were related to measures of persistence and cognitive ability in two structured tasks. The third study, &quot;Cognitive Play Experience and 13-Month-Old Infant Performance with Objects,&quot; utilized interviews with mothers to determine the kinds of experiences infants had while practicing skills in object play in interaction with others. The key variable, variety of cognitive activity in social play, was significantly related to infant mastery motivation and cognitive functioning. Following reports of the three studies, two papers are presented which discuss the studies and the concept of mastery motivation. (MS)",

A state-wide survey of child care needs in Nevada was conducted followed by a special study of Clark County, which has 56% of the state's child population. In addition, members of the Culinary Union in Las Vegas and Reno were surveyed as to their needs and attitudes toward child care. A system was developed for measuring the quality of child care facilities and the competence of caregivers. Also, a study was made of current  programs of employer-supported child care throughout the United States. Examples of such programs are described, and federal government policies which promote industrial child care are discussed. Lengthy appendices, which make up the bulk of the document, include: (1) detailed reports of the survey of union members and the survey of the Clark County general population, as well as a brief comparison of the two surveys; and (2) an extensive draft of a voluntary accreditation system proposed for the state of Nevada which consists of separate procedural manuals for accrediting child care facilities and credentialing staff members who serve as directors, caregivers, or joint director/caregivers.

Also investigated is the hypothesis that children's errors at terminal levels of performance in a two-choice probability learning situation are attributable to errors resulting from attention to irrelevant dimensions. Subjects were 31 third grade and 47 fourth grade children who were given a two-choice probability learning task in which one relevant dimension (brightness or position) and one irrelevant dimension (position or brightness) were present. One of two reinforcement probabilities (2:1 or 5:1) was utilized. Children's preferences for  aspects of the irrelevant dimension were found to account for more errors than would be expected by chance. The use of alternation strategies was differentially affected by both the reinforcement probability and the relevant dimension employed in the task. The results offered some support for the hypothesis that errors at terminal levels of performance can be accounted for by attention to irrelevant dimensions. An important finding was that the relationship between alternation strategies and performance was jointly determined by the relevant dimension and the reinforcement configuration employed.

        "description":"This study attempts to investigate the effects of increased maternal visual regard on neonatal social visual behavior and upon patterns of mother-neonate interaction within the context of a learning theory paradigm. Subjects were 3-day-old neonates and their mothers; with 10 of the 15 mother-neonate pairs as the experimental group, and 5 as the control group. Using an ABA experimental design, the investigation employed a modified time-sampling procedure with two observers simultaneously watching the neonate-mother interaction and recording a precoded list of variables on a special coding sheet. Experimental mothers were asked to increase the amount of time they spent looking into their babies' eyes without changing any of their other normal caretaking/interacting behaviors during  the second phase. For the return to baseline phase, mothers were asked to disregard previous instructions and return to their normal routines of caretaking/interacting. Control mothers were given no instructions governing their interacting behaviors. Trend analyses were performed to explore experimental phase differences and correlations were computed for maternal neonatal variables according to group. Results indicate that increased maternal visual regard appears to have had effects upon neonatal social visual behaviors and patterns of neonate-mother interaction. It was found that the patterns of interrelationship of maternal and neonatal behaviors were strikingly different for the two groups. In addition, control mothers talked more often to their daughters than their sons and  experimental mothers talked equally to sons and daughters. (Author/SB)",

In order to function in an open classroom, teachers must recognize their own worth and refuse to accept the stereotype of the incompetency of public school teachers. Of prime importance in the open classroom is the capacity of the teacher for using judgment in making and retracting decisions and in assessing what the teacher and children are in need of learning. The teacher does not hesitate to show her feelings, within socially acceptable bounds, and accepts the feelings of  children as well. In the open classroom, the teacher organizes the room for productive interaction of people with each other and with materials and ideas. The teacher herself must be a learner in order to stimulate learning. Evaluation begins and continues with the teacher's perceptions, and the process as well as the end product of a child's learning is evaluated. Finally, the role of the teacher involves interaction with colleagues in establishing a school climate of which her classroom is a part. (MS)",

Innovative and tested instructional bilingual-bicultural components (language, perceptual, health, motor and cognitive) are being implemented in an attempt to reach children with limited English speaking ability from low income families. The primary focus of this evaluation was on the nursery school unit serving 3- and 4-year-old children at two sites. Evaluation of the instructional activities was based on a pretest and posttest design using standardized tests measuring language development in Spanish and English, school readiness, and self-concept and personality development. Staff development, parental  involvement and materials development components were subjectively evaluated. Major findings included: (1) nursery school children made significant gains in language development (Spanish and English), school readiness, and motor ability, and showed growth in self-concept and personal development; (2) students in grades K-2 made significant gains in language development in Spanish and English and school readiness; (3) instructional, staff development and materials development components were effective, but the parent involvement component needs to be strengthened.

        "description":"This study explored the relationship between maternal sensitivity and the development of mother-infant vocal interaction. Two characteristics of mother and infant vocalizations were assessed at six and nine months in a home feeding situation: (1) the degree of mutual responsiveness, and (2) the affective quality of vocalization. These assessments of vocal interaction were compared with assessments of maternal sensitivity and cooperation made during the same feeding situations. Subjects were 28 middle class mothers and infants, videotaped at home during lunchtime feedings. Five-minute samples of feedings were analyzed according to a mutual responsiveness instrument developed by the author, an affect rating scale designed by Adamson, Tronick, Brazelton, and Als (1975), and maternal  sensitivity scales developed by Ainsworth (19691). The most significant and stable relationships found were those comparing mother and infant vocalization with maternal sensitivity. Infants of highly sensitive mothers appeared to rely increasingly on vocalization during feeding to signal states of comfort, hunger, or other needs and desires related to eating. Overall, sensitive mothers did less talking as their infants began to vocalize more. Highly sensitive mothers seemed to allow for reciprocity by adjusting their own vocal stimulation to the vocal production of their babies. Relationships between cooperation and mother-infant vocal interaction were generally weaker than those summarized above. (Author/SB)",

The CAS has as its purpose the assessment of the performance of child care workers and the granting of Child Development Associate (CDA) credentials to those who demonstrate competence in caring for children. During the development stage of the CAS two field studies were conducted: (1) the 1974 field study, which was intended to test the feasibility of assessing candidates using the Consortium's assessment model, to plan research and coordinate assessment with the credentialing system, and to conduct formulative research on the prototype assessment system; and (2) the 1975 field study, which provided information about how well the revised  assessment process worked in the field. Following these studies a decision was made to implement the CAS, and a third study was conducted to evaluate the first year of implementation (1975-76). The evaluation study and both field studies are described in detail in this report. Included also is information about the development of the CDA consortium and the six steps in the credential award system. (MS)",

Current institutional arrangements in the United Kingdom for government provision of education and care for young children are discussed and proposals are made for alternative ways of providing this service. It is suggested that certain traditional views of the family and its role in society are outmoded and that the position of children in society has changed. Subsection topics are: the family, children, history of provision for young children in Britain, aims of nursery education, the divided system (i.e. division between nursery care and nursery education), alternative systems, and problems of implementation. The conclusion emphasizes that problems  cited are not unique to Britain but are common to almost all industrial societies. The realities of the high cost of outside care and education are also underlined. (BF)",

        "description":"The content and process of incidental learning of sex role related characteristics through play behavior was explored in a study of more than 6000 toys sold by Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company between 1900 and 1970, as represented in their mail order catalogs. Sixty percent of all toys were sex typed by Sears. The nature of the play behavior associated with each sex's toys was examined by decade. Each toy was categorized according to 13 characteristics which were thought to be related to sex role behavior. Trend analyses of characteristic clusters were presented and projections were made from these trends to create hypothetical profiles of males and females of the future. Three basic research questions posed were: (1) Are toys sex typed? (2) Are there differences in the sex typing of  male toys and female toys? (3) Are there relationships between characteristics within each sex? Conclusions are affirmative in connection with all three questions. Sears catalogs are described as a reflection of the contemporary American value system, with toys such as Sears' considered to be socializing agents of the future, providing possibly valuable information about anticipated sex role behavior in the next few decades.

Moral education is discussed in terms of four basic questions: (1) Is there a need for it? (2) If so, is it the job of the schools to teach morality? (3) What is moral development? and (4) If fostering moral development in the schools is considered necessary and legitimate, how does one go about it in a way that is educationally effective and ethically defensible in a pluralistic society? Suggestions for fostering moral development in the school include using materials that promote discussion of moral decisions; planning projects that naturally stimulate children to work together (cooking, crafts, etc.); fostering a sense of community among  children in the classroom by setting aside time for children to meet as a class and share what they have worked on, discuss an experience they have had together or exchange views on how to solve a problem that has arisen; intervening directly at times to help children develop more cooperative behaviors; and respecting children's rights and dignity as persons.

The PBT Scales deal with a range of infant responses to situations such as social and autonomous play, feeding preferences and scheduling, bathing and the infant's pattern of sleep and wake cycles. Items selected were restricted to those likely to be familiar to both fathers and mothers. (The PBT's focus on parental perception is seen as contributing to a fuller understanding of the complex interactional dynamics between parent and infant.) Results reported are basically  internal analyses of the psychometric properties of the instrument and the congruence of maternal and paternal perceptions. The nine conceptual dimensions of the PBT used were: activity, rhythmicity, adaptability, approach to novel experience, positive mood, threshold, persistence, distractibility and intensity. (BF)",

The riddle is described as a verbal routine which adapts the interrogative system of a speech community to purposes of play. Riddles concerning motion or locomotion of animals, machines and toys were collected in a single riddling session, from three Chicano children aged 5-7. The output of these neophyte riddles is discussed in the context of the acquisition and refinement of cognitive categories, and a folk taxonomy focused on the semantic domain of locomotion is suggested. Riddling is viewed as a didactic mechanism conducive to experimentation with received notions of order, and elaboration of novel cognitive orders. In riddling, at various  stages, children learn to formulate culturally acceptable classifications; to articulate classifications at variance with cultural conventions; and finally to assess language and classification as arbitrary instruments reflecting only partially the continuous texture of experience.

Through the use of Cognitive Abilities Test (CAT) scores and surveys, two kindergarten groups were compared. One group attended school for a half-day daily; the other attended all day on alternate days, but for a comparable length of time. A summary of survey results from parents, kindergarten teachers, and elementary principals is presented. CAT scores turned up non-significant differences between the two groups. Teacher opinion surveys found a relationship between the teacher's attitude towards her all-day program and her students' performance. Opinion surveys from principals, parents, and teachers showed the largest factor for consideration to be the child's maturation level. Large motor and  social skills were more easily taught in the alternate day-full day program; art and language skills in a daily program. Considering all variables, it was concluded that the type of program was not the contributing factor for its success. It was concluded that not every child will adjust to an all-day program. Teacher instruction and program, school curriculum, and skill development are factors to be considered before an all-day kindergarten program is adopted by a school system. Appendixed are survey questionnaires and the alternate day-full day kindergarten program daily schedule. (JH)",

Of these, 25 were younger students (approximate ages 8 to 12) with IQ's greater than 160, and 13 were older (approximate ages 12 1/2 to 14) with IQ's in the range of 150. The children were tested individually in their homes on three formal operational tasks adopted from Inhelder and Piaget as well as two moral reasoning dilemmas from Adelson and Piaget. The formal operational tasks were: communicating vessels,  oscillation in a pendulum, and a balance problem. Tasks are described. Scoring was adopted from Inhelder and Piaget. Two judges assigned one of four categorical ratings, two concrete and two formal, to each task. Results indicate that high ability in children over the age of 11 does carry over into formal operations; but that bright children under 11 years demonstrate a low rate of precocity in formal operational ability, with exception of the pendulum problem. These results and responses to the moral questions are discussed. (Author/SB)",

This OCD Information System evolved around the need for accurate and timely data pertaining to publicly funded day care centers. Allowance was made for possible subsequent inclusion of family and group day care facilities. A preliminary study of six South Carolina counties showed a lack of uniformity in record-keeping and the need for a computerized information system. The three data collection instruments described here were designed to implement development of an integrated data base: (1) a Client-Guardian Record, (2) a Center Record and (3) an Employee Record. These instruments were designed to collect, aggregate,  analyze and disseminate data in a concise and confidential manner for the use of authorized state agencies. During the initial demonstration phase of the system's implementation, OCD personnel were involved in field work to educate day care center personnel in use of the record forms. Informational printouts, derived from continually updated data, include state, county and center summaries, as well as client and employee rosters. Approximately half this document consists of samples of record forms and summary reports. (BF)",

The purpose behind the study was the further investigation of behavioral observation and intervention techniques used by other researchers as alternatives to prolonged medication therapy for hyperactive children. Subjects were 11 elementary school children in grades K through 2. The control group consisted of all classroom peers who, by virtue of their non-referral, were identified as not hyperactive. Subjects and controls were observed in the classroom and their behaviors charted using a time sampling procedure that recorded behavior frequency of 19 categories of behavior.  Significant differences were found between groups on behaviors in seven categories: approval, volunteers, initiation to teacher, physical negative, play, inappropriate locale, and self-stimulation. In all of these categories, except volunteers, the control group had lower frequencies of occurrence. Having delineated the specific types of behavior that the hyperactive children engaged in more frequently, the authors suggested a behavioral intervention program be implemented to decrease or extinguish targeted behaviors.

Subjects were 1,169 children (513 black, 656 white) in grades 2 and 5, who were taken from either a lower-middle, upper-lower class urban or a suburban community. Gender was divided fairly equally. The children were tested in their schools, with examiner race varying equally at each grade level. Results indicated that all children tended to select children of the same sex for the positive attributes, but that both boys  and girls selected boys for the negative attributes. Although all Sex Pride scores decreased with age, this was most exaggerated for the girls from a lower-middle, upper-lower class urban environment. (Author/SB)",

The instrument was commissioned by the Madison Public Schools (Wisconsin) to evaluate the Individual Differences program designed to help primary grade children deal with racial, physical, and social differences and their perceptions of them. An instrument was developed that relied on pictures and oral language. Children were presented with pictures of groups of children. Figures were drawn so that six basic dimensions for discrimination resulted: size, dress, sex, physical disability, ethnic grouping, learning ability. Associated with each picture was a stimulus question requiring a response by the children (e.g. Which children are  Americans?) Results are tabled and discussed for kindergarten, first, and second grades involved in the program. Checks for reliability and validity are described. Results support the possibility of measuring the effect of a public school program of individual differences using the individual differences instrument. Effectiveness of the program is briefly discussed. (Author/SB)",

        "description":"This study compared children's dependence on situational cues by a model to their reliance on the general affective valence of the model, in order to assess the role of each in determining vicarious changes in preference. Subjects were forty 4-year-olds attending a day care center. Among five toys used in pilot testing, a box of clothespins was rated lowest in attractiveness and thus was selected as the target toy for training. Two measures of each child's toy preference were collected in a pretest: rated comparisons of clothespins versus other toys and timed use of clothespins during free play. The children were assigned to one of four modeling treatments (high model valence, low model valence, high affect, low affect or a control group.) Each treatment consisted of an  interaction phase, a modeling phase, and a posttest. Results indicated no difference among experimental groups in pretest scores. Analysis of the posttest measures revealed that the children exposed to the model who displayed a high degree of subjective affect while playing with the clothespins significantly increased the ratings of clothespins and the amount of time spent playing with this toy. The model's rewardingness (valence) failed to exert any effect on either dependent measure, and did not interact with model affectivity. Findings are discussed in terms of the role of classical conditioning and cognitive processes in vicarious learning; and the results are seen as supporting the role of cognitive processing.

Subjects were 88 neonates between 12 and 36 hours old. The sample included 37 low birthweight, 25 premature, and 19 small for gestational age infants. Cries were elicited by snapping the soles of the babies' feet with a rubber band. Four dependent variables, two acoustic and two behavioral, were extracted from each infant's cry episode. Because other independent variables such as gestational age, sex, and race might confound the prediction of crying from birthweight, a  multiple regression analysis was done on the data. A separate regression analysis was computed for each of the four dependent variables, in which the independent variables were birthweight, gestational age, sex, and race. Results indicate that birthweight and gestational age were relatively equal in predicting the pitch of the cry; but that birthweight, and not gestational age, was related to the latency of the cry. The predicting of abnormal conditions from cry properties is discussed. (Author/SB)",

Intended for use by both parents and teachers at the beginning and end of the kindergarten year, the PTKSA is presented as a vehicle for meaningful home-school interaction early in a child's school life. The items are described as developmental and easily observed in a home or school setting. The basic idea involves: (1) parents making judgments about their own child at home, (2) the teacher making independent judgments on the same items at school, and (3) parent and teacher reviewing these  judgments together and planning accordingly. A sample is given, involving 243 pupils and 11 teachers, of eight items from the 28-item PTKSA. Items are from four categories: (1) Use of Symbols (counting, reading words, time-awareness); (2) Motor Skills; (3) Language Development; and (4) Behavior (cooperation, consideration for others, choice-making). Also presented are correlations between PTKSA and other test instruments, including the Boehm Test of Basic Concepts, used in the formal assessment procedure by the school district in which PTKSA has been developed.

Thirty-six children, ranging from 46 to 67 months of age, were invited to look at a set of stimulus materials (e.g., biological specimens and household implements). Half of the children examined the materials with a peer and half did so alone. One-third of the children in each peer condition were presented the materials as objects that they were free to touch, one-third as objects that they could not touch, and one-third  as life-size photographs of the objects. Two types of questions asked by the children about the stimuli were analyzed: (1) identification questions (viz., questions concerning the objects' names) and (2) transformational questions (viz., questions involving broader speculations about the objects such as their origin, function, etc.). Results revealed that the children asked significantly fewer identification questions when with a peer than when alone. The children who could touch the objects asked the most transformational questions; those who could not touch the objects asked the next most; and those shown photos of the objects asked the least.

Subjects were 22 male and 30 female students from a predominantly white, middle class rural school. Temporal behavior was assessed with a task that had subjects reproduce standard time intervals. Three forms of discrimination-reversal learning were employed: original learning, a first reversal shift, and a second reversal shift. Mastery of each form consisted of the subject choosing on each trial between two stimulus objects varying in two dimensions until a mastery criterion level of eight consecutive correct trials was reached. Results indicate that: (1) temporal performance tends to be less variable than  learning performance; (2) a significant, negative correlation exists between mean time and mean learning scores; and (3) relatively fast learning is associated with relative overestimation of time whereas relatively slow learning is associated with relative underestimation of time. These results contrast with previously reported results within adult subjects wherein relative underestimation was associated with fast learning and overestimation with slow learning. These contrasting results may be the manifestation of a developmental temporal pattern which shifts from a predominantly inhibitory trend during childhood towards a predominantly excitatory trend in adulthood.

A sample of 99 white middle-class families participated in a 2-hour structured interview in their homes. The interview consisted mainly of revealed difference exercises for parents and for the entire family, and a projective task in which family members described their family system as to: (1) patterns of communication, (2) approach to conflict, (3) degree of individuation, and (4) affective climate. Each family contained an adolescent teenage girl who had previously completed Loevinger's measure of ego development, the California Personality Inventory, and a  sociometric questionnaire. This paper presents some preliminary results of the study of 30 families comparing families of the 15 girls who scored highest on the psychological and sociometric measures with families of the 15 girls who scored lowest. Results show that adolescents in the high-scoring group come from families more likely to describe themselves as flexible and trusting in their interpersonal lifestyle. High-scoring adolescents' perceptions of their families tend to be closer to those of their parents than those of low scorers. Differences in the interaction patterns between parents of the two groups suggest that parents of the high scorers may have more functional approaches to problem-solving situations than do parents of low scorers.

The unit focuses on the interaction between space, materials, classroom activities and educational goals, and is particularly appropriate for educators interested in providing an open education setting. Section I describes six basic classroom areas in terms of 12 variables covering size, boundaries, materials, working surfaces, and functions. The relationship of these variables to classroom operations and the solution of management problems through classroom arrangement and modification of the six basic areas are explored. Section II provides an illustrated and descriptive guide to  physical facilities and resources. Topics covered are: storage, working surfaces and seating, the floor, raised work and play platforms, enclosed areas, room and area dividers. A reference list of publications, films, and additional resource addresses is included. Each chapter contains a topic introduction, learner-activities, and a follow-up discussion. Learner-activities include classroom observations, simulation and decision-making problems. Activity forms are provided for recording activity results.

Management is approached as the process of organizing and structuring the classroom, its activities, and the responsibilities of staff and children. Management is directed toward helping children assume responsibility for their own behavior in a climate designed to maximize individual freedom and minimize disturbances in the learning environment. Criteria for classroom management establishing rules and limits, scheduling, and the provisioning and use of materials are explored in the context of minimizing the occurence of management problems. Practice is provided in developing rules and  limits, arranging classroom activities, developing daily plans, demonstrating the arrangement of materials, and extending and adapting classroom materials to meet individual needs. In a discussion on how to handle inappropriate behavior, topics include: determining the problem; anticipating and redirecting inappropriate behavior; attending to positive behavior, contingent use of classroom activities, using time out, and why punishment is an inappropriate form of classroom management. Activities involve classroom observation, demonstration, working with children, thought and problem-solving activities. (Author/SB)",

Problems are treated as opportunities to learn in which individuals or groups want something changed, are personally affected, and are in a position to assume responsibility for solving the problems. Problems in the cognitive, social and personal domains are considered. Skills in problem identification and clarification, idea generation, implementation of solutions, and evaluation of results are explored. More than half of the book is devoted to teaching techniques for guiding children in problem solving activity. Techniques  are grouped under &quot;tuning in,&quot;&quot;drawing out,&quot; guiding, and supporting the creation of possible solutions. Skills involve listening, paraphrasing, questioning, creating analogies and imagery, and connecting creations to reality. Thought problems, recognition of examples, recall of experiences, observations of children, classroom practice, and role play are embedded in 26 activities. Examples of classroom problems are interspersed among the activities.

        "description":"This unit of the Flexible Learning System (FLS) is designed to help teachers analyzing the effects of classroom situations on the self-concepts of children in preschool through third grade. Among the questions addressed are: What is a healthy self-concept; How do teaching practices affect children's self-concepts; and When are situations demeaning, restricting, overrating, or enhancing to the self-concept? It is proposed that self-concepts develop as children take credit for what they do and what they are, and as they integrate the results of new experiences. The first 60 pages contain guidelines for conducting an 8-session class or workshop. Workshop sessions involve a variety of activities including assigning positive/negative ratings to a set of standard situations, using an  analysis instrument for more detailed ratings of classroom situations, rating personally observed situations, and producing and discussing ways to improve situations. It is suggested that individual ratings and analyses be shared with partners or with a group, allowing the benefit of more than one point of view. The workshop guidelines are followed by three resource booklets, each approximately 40 pages long, containing readings about self-concept as well as examples and discussions of classroom situations and their relation to self-concept. Situations presented in the resource booklets are reproduced on sets of cards which are included with the document.

Techniques for helping children use and extend their personal experiences in language arts activities are described, and the use of children's experiences in classroom learning to create integrated language experiences is also discussed. Four semisequential sections are included, covering the integration of language with listening, fantasy, memory of familiar experiences, and spontaneous classroom activity. Language is viewed as a personal-social form of expression including art, movement-dance, written/oral language, reading and prereading skills. Each section  presents a guided sequence of activities for the learner: exploring criteria for integrating activities; participating in an integrating experience illustrating the criteria; sharing; reviewing and evaluation; planning activities for children; implementation of plans; and evaluation of outcomes. Planning is approached in guided steps moving the learner from modification of prescribed plans to extension of plans with additional follow up activities for children, and ending in the creation of original activities. Examples of teacher generated plans for children of varying ages are provided throughout the text and in a 50-page learner's resource booklet (included).

        "description":"This unit of the Flexible Learning System (FLS), designed for adults working with children aged 4-8, is concerned with sensory experiences to promote learning in the early childhood years. Texture, weight, size-shape, taste, hearing, and sight are explored in a sequence of learning activities repeated for each sense mode. The learning-activity sequence involves participating in an adult sensory experience, constructing a sense-word list, exploring and constructing learning objectives for children, diagnosing sensory skills in children, and creating sense-modality learning experiences for children. Learning objectives for children incorporate experiences in naming, matching, comparing and contrasting, classifying, ordering, describing, identifying, tracing, predicting and  explaining. The diagnosis of individual children's conceptual use of sense is explored in the context of natural observations and adult probes during normal classroom activities. Individual and small group activities, classroom observations, and work with children are integrated to achieve skill in promoting cognitive growth through sensory experience; skill in diagnosing the child's conceptual use of senses; skill in using diagnosis to plan and provide sensory activities that support cognitive growth; and the development of a sense perception curriculum.

        "description":"This unit of the Flexible Learning System (FLS) describes the development of children's concepts and presents ways that adults can facilitate conceptual learning in children between 2 and 8 years of age. Concepts are described as representable, sharable and organized knowledge formulated around interests, susceptible to agreement and disagreement, and in some cases, capable of being forgotten. Suggested activities for adults involve analysis of adult concepts and their representation, adult classification activities, interviews of children, classroom observation, and thought problems. Activities are designed to explore ten characteristics of concepts; how concepts are organized; how the organization of concepts changes with mental development; how concepts are represented; how  interests determine the formation of concepts; and guidelines for educational practice that support conceptual growth. Written material provides an introduction and follow-up to each activity. The appendix contains notes on clinical interviewing of children and a bibliography. Familiarity with the content of the series &quot;Exploring Children's Thinking,&quot; also a part of the FLS, provides a foundation for understanding this book. An understanding of the mental development of classification skills is considered prerequisite.

        "description":"A sample of 43 boys and 43 girls (aged 32 to 63 months) was observed during interactions with a 13-month-old infant in a structured situation in a day care center. Attendance in an area surrounding an empty playpen, and behaviors in that area, were recorded on four preliminary days to adapt children to observers and measure baseline behavior; on two days when a baby was in the playpen; and on two days when the baby was absent but a control stimulus, a tank with a goldfish, was placed in front of the playpen. Among the findings: (1) girls spent significantly more time in the area than boys when the baby was present, but not on other days; (2) older boys spent significantly less time in the area than younger boys when the baby was present, but there was no age effect for girls; (3)  girls and boys who were in the area when the baby was present spent approximately the same proportion of their time engaging in baby-related activities. The most common of these activities involved the establishment and maintenance of proximity with the infant by approaching and touching the playpen. Verbalizations about the baby were frequent, but to the baby were rare. The study raises questions concerning the evolution of observed behavior: the role of adult modeling, effect of the model's sex, the children's past experience with infants, the part played by age and sex, and behavior of the infant as stimulus in reciprocal interactions.

The completed survey instrument was returned by 40 states. Findings are summarized in terms of percentages of State Offices of Education indicating existing provisions for the development of preschool education. No national trend was shown, with the status of preschool education varying from state to state. Many states reported involvement in curriculum  development, in-service education, and the development of basic guidelines for preschool educators. A majority of the state offices had developed some philosophical statement concerning quality preschool education, but only some had allocated funds to support their belief. Other findings include the fact that a large majority of the offices were working with universities on developing courses of study, certification requirements, and/or teacher training programs. Many had developed curriculum guides and/or material for dissemination. It was emphasized that, although an expansion of child care facilities is anticipated, evidence indicates that many states lack mandated guidelines to insure quality preschool education. (BF)",

The sentences were at three different levels of linguistic complexity, differing only in whether simultaneity or sequentiality was described. Subjects were kindergarten, second, and fourth grade children from middle class homes where English was the only language used. Sentence comprehension was measured by a verification task. Results indicate that sentences describing simultaneity were better understood than descriptions of sequentiality. This finding supports the hypothesis that the cognitive complexity of the meaning expressed by language forms is an important determinant of comprehension. Findings contradict previous studies  using different tasks that found opposite results, suggesting that cognitive complexity is not an absolute property of concepts, but depends on the processing requirements of specific tasks. The requirements of several previous tasks are compared to those of the present task, in which memory requirements were greater for sentences expressing sequentiality. (Author/SB)",

Conducted in McKinley County, the program involved six small rural schools its first two years and a large new  consolidated school its third year. Classrooms were composed of children from Indian, Spanish, and Anglo backgrounds. Teachers learned about their students through achievement, mental maturity, and personality standardized tests, interest inventories, sociometric devices, pupil reactionaries, diaries, open questions, case studies, home visits, informal interviews, and observations. As the program developed, it was shown that Indian children could make rapid progress in the public schools with technical assistance, adequate instructional materials, and trained teachers who had been provided with the necessary resources and an understanding of the child's background.

        "description":"The paper examines the social structure of Canada's agricultural production. It argues that &quot;the official development strategy is typical of state involvement in maturing capitalist economies and that, in so far as these policies are successful, they bring to an end small scale production of primary products by absorbing rural people into an industrial capitalist society&quot;. In 1961, the Federal government initiated an agricultural rehabilitation and development programme. Later the legislation was expanded to include the whole question of regional development. A detailed breakdown of farms by economic class in 1971 indicated that the petit bourgeoisie, although still dominant in numbers, was economically dominated by a small group of large capitalist enterprises, although there  was much variation by region and type of product. This relative weakness of the petit bourgeois system of production resulted in rural poverty and regional depopulation. Large scale, technically sophisticated industry, located in the major urban markets, had made small manufacturing uncompetitive, even in its local markets. In order to provide for their families, many of the poorest farmers migrated to more rewarding urban employment. In so far as they are successful, the government policies on rural and regional development in Canada have actually sped up this process. (NQ)",

        "description":"During May of 1974 and of 1976, needs assessment questionnaires were distributed to American Indian parents to determine their perception of the Title IV Program and its effectiveness. In 1974, 50 parents responded to the questionnaire. In 1976, 37 parents responded to the questionnaire which had been revised. Both years, several of the returned questionnaires were not complete. Therefore, it was assumed that the respondent either did not know the answer or felt unsure and left the answer block unanswered. Among the 1974 findings were: 35 to 38% felt much improvement had come about for their children because of the Program, 35% failed to respond to this item; 58% claimed the Program enabled them to become more involved in the school affairs that affected their children and 40%  felt the Program had a significant effect in the educational programs with the Albuquerque Public School System. Some of the 1976 findings were: parents felt the schools were doing somewhere above &quot;little&quot; and should be doing better than &quot;much&quot; to satisfy the Indian student's needs; language arts was ranked the most important subject, followed by counseling and math; and parents felt a greater emphasis should be placed on math programs. This report gives the questionnaires and the responses to each question. (NQ)",

        "description":"Studies conducted by the University of Tulsa, Arizona State University, Utah State University, and the Indian Health Service have indicated a high incidence of handicapping conditions among the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) student population. Of the approximately 50,000 students in the nearly 200 BIA schools, some 19,000 have been estimated to need special education services. Of these, about 4,000 are currently receiving some type of special education service. Although considerable special education activity has taken place in BIA schools over the past nine years, some 95% of the special education programs in the BIA have been operated with flow-through funds from the U.S. Office of Education. Some of these programs are Project COPE, Project PISCES, Project ASSET, Project  IN-SLIP, Project MESA, and Project MASTER. Each year since 1972, the Office of Indian Education Programs has sought line item funding for special education in BIA schools, but has not been able to obtain it. Neither are there BIA regulations concerning the education of the handicapped. The two outstanding present needs concerning full special education services in the BIA are: budget line item for initiating and maintaining special education programs and services in BIA operated schools, and mandatory legislation with respect to the education of exceptional Indian children.

The proposed regulations eliminated the factor of Indian tax-exempt land as a prerequisite in determining eligibility for participation under the JOM program. As the potentially eligible were now eligible (under new BIA regulations), the survey defined these two groups as: reservation based--longtime eligible JOM children and non-reservation based--additional eligible JOM children (under a low priority) based on BIA regulations. Data were obtained from census data and the 1975 surveys of Indian students in public schools completed by all states for various ethnic purposes. This report presents a brief discussion of the basic  eligibility criteria for enumerating eligible Indian children; a review of laws, regulations, policies, and the intent of Congress regarding assistance to Indian children in public, private, and parochial schools; and tabular data. Tabular data summarizes the: reservation based and non-reservation based Indian children in the 24 states where Indian lands are held in trust by the U.S. government; total number of eligible and potentially eligible Indian children in all states; and number of now eligible non-reservation based Indian children in states without Indian trust lands. Brief comments on each state situation follow the statistical summaries. (NQ)",

Findings indicated: the majority of the respondents preferred places of less than 50,000 in population, but that when conditionals were introduced, preferences for smaller places diminished greatly; the vast majority were satisfied with their present communities and  had little or no desire to migrate even though they preferred smaller places; 14% of the respondents were potential migrants; 7% of the respondents were potential migrants from areas larger than 50,000 to smaller areas; the number of people interested in smaller areas decreased as distance from urban area increased and decreased further when the economic conditional of a 10% loss of family income was added; when controlling for potential migrants and nonmigrants, the percentage was further reduced; population dispersal would not take place without the aid of a national policy equalizing social and economic amenities.

        "description":"Since the 1960s the number of Danish wives going out to work has increased. In 1975, a national survey was conducted to elucidate farmers' wives' work performance in their homes and on and outside the farm. Only women under the age of 60 who were married to self-employed farmers with holdings of more than 5 hectares (1 hectare = 2.47 acres) were interviewed. Based on interviews with 320 women, these wives were divided into 4 groups: those who attended to the housework and had no other employment--wives not going out to work; those who assisted their husbands but had no other employment--assisting wives; those who had work outside the home and did not assist with farm work--working wives; and those who assisted with farm work and also had work outside the farm--assisting and going  out to work. Some findings were: 26% were gainfully employed outside the farm, 72% normally assisted on the farm, and 16% had no employment besides their housework; women who went out to work were frequently found among the younger ones who had received vocational training; assisting wives were mainly found on the medium-sized holdings, ranging in size from 10 to 29 hectares; in most cases, employment outside the farm had given the farmer's wife a double workload; and assisting and going out to work wives were not relieved of domestic chores to a larger extent than the other wives.

Using the 1970 population census, data were obtained on the: age distribution of women, rate of economically active women in the women population, distribution of active women in the branches of national economy, qualifications and education, number of children, and supply of kindergarten and nursery. Settlements were clustered on the basis of: number of inhabitants, economic and functional types, and activity level of women. Correlation and multiple correlation analyses were used to clarify the ramifying  interactions. Among the findings were: the highest rate of women activity level was found in the counties of Pest, Bacs-Kiskun, and Zala; the most important obstacles of involving women living in villages into employment besides agriculture were the very low educational level and specialization, the lack of suitable working opportunities in industry or in tertiary sectors, and the number of children, which was higher than in towns; and heavy industry did not ensure good opportunities for women employment, but attracted the industrial branches, where women might be employed.

        "description":"The tempo of social change is ever more rapid and the rate of technico-economic change is still more rapid. But the transformation of man's psychosomatic system takes place much more slowly. Therefore, the theoretical premises of the development of the rural areas and of the local community should be considered on that background. The pressure of new phenomena in the sphere of the theory of needs and the maturing of new problems demanding solutions both on the scale of the local community and of the society as a whole, requires new theoretical methodological as well as programmatic and sociotechnical solutions. There is no universal theory able to generalize the law of social development by abstracting from the current accumulated stock of knowledge, way of thinking, and the  range of ignorance. It is thus periodically necessary to verify the theoretical formulations, disclose doubts, and work out new theoretical ideas and modes of action. This applies to situations when the procedure of cognition of the social reality is improved and when an attempt is made to transform that reality. This paper discusses the determination of the content of the principal theoretical premises; the village as a scientific problem and social value of interdisciplinary research; the village and the humanist accounting; and the role of the village in the planning society and models of the future civilization.

Three images of Indians have developed: the savage, the child, and the noble of the forest (the stoic Indian). The images of the savage and the child come into play when the Indian encounters the dominant society since he does not share the values of the dominant society, i.e., individualism, competition, materialism, and goal orientation. Indian people are a \"tribal people, living closely, without much individual privacy, within large extended families. All Indian adults assume some aspect of the parental role with all children. They have developed a sensitivity which enables them to feel empathy for another person. This leads to close  psychological ties between group members. However, when Indians are moved into an urban area, they are confronted with situations that make such qualities of sharing and caring dangerous. The tribal supports are gone. He is separated from his peers, family ties, and psychic upport. All emotional support must become individualized. Yet, Indian people are generally psychologically sturdy and have a low rate of psychosis of any kind. (NQ)",

        "description":"In view of the 1973 changes brought about by the State's attempt to bring its authority closer to society and create new arrangements to satisfy rural needs, Poland's rural communities were analyzed in terms of a typology of social action. Defined as action and the desire to act resulting from membership in the local community, social action was identified via essential types derived from the need for: life necessities; emotional ties; and social affirmation. In Polish rural areas, there was evidence of an evolutionary trend indicating changing cultural values; wherein, man was being understood in terms of an intellectual rather than an emotional personality; the direct aspect of folk culture was being replaced by more indirect influences; Polish rural areas were entering the  development stage of &quot;shaping up life quality&quot;; individual social activity was being influenced by social status; social activity was being influenced by both the physical and attitudinal aspects of the current modernization process. Operative at the awareness, acceptance, and cultural objectivization levels, innovative social action was performing the function of social control via selectivity, a phenomenon making social action leaders vital to the total rural-cultural picture and making human personality, as manifest in social activity, the most essential aspect of the principle of social action as a means to cultural change.

Three types of migration orientations were identified (highly immobile, indifferent, and highly motivated). The data were analyzed in terms of: reappraisals; personal and domestic motives; difficulties; advocated favorable rural conditions; occupational factors; financial considerations; unfavorable urban conditions; etc. Results indicated: potential migration could be used to predict actual rural to urban migration, since 64% of the sample were persons who had been, were,  or would become rural to urban migrants; the decision to migrate sometimes disappeared altogether due to certain objective and subjective factors; actual, though not always recognized, attachment to the rural way of life was a strong factor influencing migration decisions (34% gave up their intentions to migrate); 41% of the most likely migrants had migrated; 92.2% of the migrants were satisfied with their new life; and 87.8% of the migrants did not want to return to rural places.

Data were taken from 2 sampling sociological-statistical surveys of 157 rural communities of the Novosibirsk province in West Siberia (USSR). A two-dimensional typology of centrality and social-branch structure of production was used. By using the centrality factor which was derived from 17 interconnected variables representing the community's administrative significance, its place in intrafarm settlement pattern, and level of development of key services, the communities were classified as backward hinterland, advanced hinterland, and centres. Communities were also grouped into agrarian-kolkhoz, agrarian-sovkhoz, and suburban-industrial according to: enterprise type (collective or state farm or  nonfarm), the proportion of farm and of industrially employed, average family income from private economy, and the proportion of families residing in enterprise-owned houses. To describe the various employment situations in the public sector of communities with different urbanization levels, the branch structure of jobs and skill hierarchy of workers were examined. Findings included: in more urbanized rural areas job opportunities were wider and employment structure more advanced; at the same time, the dynamic character of socialist production in general and of farming in particular led, under certain circumstances, to shortages in manpower needed to produce farm products in necessary amounts.

Employed by a federally-funded community development project, the 10 held positions from secretary to chief program administrator, with salaries ranging from $6,000 to $20,000 per year. A formal 4-hour interview was conducted with each informant to obtain data on family background, economic and occupational success and satisfaction, and ethnicity. Life histories were also collected from each individual. Degree of economic success was determined by combining various measures--level of occupational skills, present salary, present status within the organization, degree of job stability within the last year, degree of expressed job  satisfaction, and degree of economic independence. Ethnicity was determined by their social networks and primary relationships, recreational and food preferences, most admired role models, religious affiliation, facility in Spanish, attitudes about Mexican and Anglo cultures, dress style, self-identification and expressed values, and display of ethnically-oriented political buttons. Findings suggested that economic factors influenced the manner in which identity was expressed, but did not bear a simple, direct correlation with the strength of an individual's ethnic identity.

Descriptive profiles of both groups provided a basis for general comparison of their background characteristics, post-training work histories, earnings, and adjustment problems. Multiple regression was used to standardize the basis for comparing the groups' wages, and to estimate the  relationships between wages and several personal characteristics. Independent variables were: rural/urban origin, sex, race, marital status, age, education, employment status just prior to TAT training, training specialty, extent that the job held was related to training, year of TAT training, and number of jobs held since TAT training. Findings included: the average wage per hour was $3.49 for the rural graduates and $3.29 for the urban; relocation, either to take better jobs or to be nearer their jobs, was more common among the rural graduates; and job terminations or layoffs were less frequent among the rural graduates.

        "description":"As contact with the American Indian people increased, Indian words, expressions, and terms filtered into the English language. On the other hand, the Indians also borrowed words from those people who came to the New World. The Jicarillas, because of their early contact with the Spanish culture and civilization, tended to borrow more words from the Spanish language rather than from the English. At a later time, however, when they had closer contact with Americans, they also borrowed words from their language, although on a limited basis. Most of the borrowed words have sounds which are Jicarilla. Therefore, some words can hardly be distinguished as Spanish or English. This booklet lists 120 words in Jicarilla which are of Spanish or English origin or show some aspects of their  influence. The words cover those aspects of life and fields of activity where the borrowed words seemed likely to originate, i.e., food and drink, plants and animals, social life, clothing, education, and other miscellaneous areas.

However, it may be held at any time during the year whenever a young girl comes of age. When this happens, a quiet ceremony is held and the celebration and feast are held the following summer. The ceremony for the feast follows strict Jicarilla customs since the people believe that the girl's future happiness and well-being depend on following the details exactly. Keesda is a busy but happy occasion for the family who is celebrating it. Relatives and friends join in the celebration, festivities, and preparations for the  feast. A young brave is chosen by the girl's father to dance with his daughter in the teepee. The girl's family, with the help of the brave's family, prepare all the necessary details of the feast. This illustrated booklet describes the activities held during the 4-day feast and gives a young brave's account of his role during the ceremony. (Author/NQ)",

Responses were received from 16 camps and interviews were completed with 275 families.

Data were also obtained on family mobility and birth  rate of the Jewish population. Some findings were: no significant relationship was found between a family's use of resident camp services and the extent to which they vacationed together; families with children attending resident camps in 1973 most frequently cited personal and social development of the child as the most important reasons for selecting this type of camp experience; and children were attending resident camps for shorter registration periods than children attending day camps.

Divided into 4 age groups (20-29, 30-44, 45-59, and 60 and over), the respondents constituted a relatively homogeneous group, being predominantly Protestant, married, and white. The median years of  formal education and the annual incomes reported were substantially higher in the urban center. Major results were: metro persons scored more favorably than nonmetro respondents on the attitude scale by a ratio of 2.5 to l.; but when controls were introduced for marital status, sex, health condition, age, and level of formal education, this ratio was modified; the greatest disparities in metro and nonmetro attitudes occurred in subjective economic deprivation and self-image, suggesting a pronounced need in the nonmetro county for interventions by action agencies with economic and mental health programs.

Results indicated:  occupation, educational attainment, and age were all significantly associated with altruistic behavior as measured by willingness to share; occupation was not related to sharing under any situation where age and education were controlled; age was related to altruism when there was a combination of high or low education and occupation; education was related to sharing with high occupation and middle age or with low occupation and other age. Study limitations were a sample including only basement owners and the possibility of nonrelated and/or limited SES variables. (JC)",

Mapping as an observational procedure, a learning experience interview, and story retelling and drawing were used to obtain data on learning processes and modes of representation. Story retelling was explored as a possible measure of bilingualism. Pueblo children were found to be self-confident and  independent at an early age; they excelled in visual representation and showed a high interest in role play. Although their verbal expression in English was not as fluent as that of non-Indians, no evidence was found to support the view of the &quot;silent&quot; Indian child--on the contrary, in their native languages and/or in comfortable settings Pueblo children were willing and capable verbal communicators. All of these patterns were linked to the nature of Pueblo communities and the children's place in them. (Author/NQ)",

Sixty-three married women from 63 separate households were interviewed. Of these 63, none were household heads. Findings included: 87% lived in &quot;Katcha&quot; houses made of mud, dung, and straw; the neater, better maintained structures (&quot;Pucca&quot; houses) belonged to the tenants; most lived in close proximity to livestock, and without separate latrine and cooking facilities; a full day was spent engaged in hard, physical labour,  interspersed with child-care, housework, food preparation, and home-related skills; their physical chores were intensified during the planting, harvest, and processing seasons; they attached greater importance to the education of males; 62% wished their daughters to be married between the age of 12 and 17; preference for sons, economic security in old age, &quot;it is God's will&quot;, and fear of birth control were given for nonacceptance of family planning; and most women disapproved of selling their skills (i.e., pickle making, straw work, clay pottery, spinning, sewing) for cash.

        "description":"Conducted in four villages situated near Tarnow, a large urban and industrial centre, this study examined the process of change in the functioning of the rural family, as set against the transformation of their general living conditions brought about by the socialist industrialization and urbanization in post-war Poland. Issues studied were: family problems in country life; formation of a new value system; new cultural demands and consumption patterns in the villages; role of endogenous and exogenous elements in the urbanization process; degree of realization of the social consequences of this process; and concrete manifestations of the process of adaptation of rural Poland to the changed situation, namely, that of a socialist industrialized community. The sample included 2  successive generations of rural families: 120 procreation families (married 5 years or less) and 120 origin families (parents and in-laws of the procreation families). It was found that the process of change consisted--within the scope of a family--mainly in a decrease of the determining effect formerly exerted by the productive-economic function upon the remaining ones, i.e., the procreational, educational, securing, and integrational-expressive functions, owing to the accessibility of extra-agricultural sources of income and to the constant decline of the significance of land as a value decisive for a given family's living conditions.

No education program can be truly effective, however, unless it has the support and the involvement of those directly benefiting from it--the Indian students, parents, and communities. Therefore, the BIA developed the Communities Have Options in Control of Education (CHOICE) Program to insure that educational self-determination becomes a fact for Indian people. With this in mind, the BIA has attempted to develop a useful implementation process to assist Indian people in making informed choices concerning educational programs and goals. This booklet describes each element in the implementation process--presentation, development  and expression of community readiness; identification of goals, objectives, and needs; translation of needs into educational possibilities; program planning and revision; program design and development; evaluation; and the status report. Each description answers four questions: who it is that performs the functions of each element; what it is that can be accomplished in each element; when each element should occur in the annual cycle; and why it is desirable that each element occur in the process.

CHOICE aims to provide for a legitimate Indian voice in all education programs operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and to help Indian communities provide for each student a program of high quality which will prepare him to make informed choices throughout his life including those instances where the schools are not operated by BIA. CHOICE ties very closely with other Bureau and Federal programs. It provides the tribe or community with options on the kind of education and the delivery system they desire. Among these  are: an educational program that respects Indian cultural values; a quality education program for Indian children enrolled in public schools; boarding schools of high quality; adequate financial assistance for undergraduate and graduate college attendance; an effective education program for exceptional children--handicapped and gifted; creative learning experiences for preschool children; adult education; summer activities; education staff who are sensitive and appreciative of the needs and heritage of Indian children and youth; and alternative education programs for Indian youth who are not in school or employed.

Part of the Bureau of Indian Affairs' Central Office of Indian Education Program, the center was established after a thorough review of the Bureau's Central Office education operations revealed a need to locate some Washington, D.C. office services closer to the scene of action. Therefore, a Field Service Office was established in Albuquerque, and part of the Washington-based education staff located there. In August 1972 the name was changed from Field Services to the Indian Education Resources Center. The center's main goal is to serve Indian education by providing leadership or help for change, and resources for improvement and  advocacy of Indian rights. It provides services to Indian students enrolled in public and Federal schools and colleges and universities. The center includes five divisions: (1) the Division of Evaluation, Research and Development; (2) the Division of Continuing Education; (3) the Division of Educational Assistance; (4) the Division of School Facilities; and (5) the Division of Educational Audio-Visual Services.

Findings included: minorities, specifically Native Americans, and women were underemployed and underrepresented in both television and the written news media; many newspapers printed articles concerning women which were biased and tended to depict them in traditional sex-stereotyped roles or in a negative fashion whenever women did not fit traditional sex roles; and reporting of news concerning both women and minorities was often unbalanced, stereotyped, or not reported.

It was hypothesized that the effects of the OB experience would: be the same for male and female participants; alter real self concept; alter the discrepancy between real and ideal self concept; change state anxiety; and increase the relationship between state and trait anxieties and real self concept. Employing pre- and post-testing procedures, tha analysis involved 23 scales of the Gough Adjective Check List to delineate both real and ideal self concept and the state and trait scales of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory to determine anxiety levels. Data  were analyzed via the Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed-Ranks test, the Mann-Whitney U test, and the Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient. Results indicated: female OB participants set higher ideals for themselves than males, but male and female anxieties and self concepts were more similar than dissimilar; OB participants experienced changes at the conclusion of the course, viewing themselves more positively and narrowing the gap between real and ideal perception; OB participants exhibited a high anxiety level just prior to the course but demonstrated a correlation between low levels of anxiety and positive self perceptions.

The report presents OB program: background; evaluation procedures; initiation rationale; funding; impact analysis; recommendations; and generalizations. Brief program descriptions are presented in the Appendix for: East High in Denver; Toledo Public Schools in Ohio; Trenton High in New Jersey; Churchill High in Eugene, Oregon; Concord-Carlisle in Massachusetts; Lincoln-Sudbury in Massachusetts; Minnetonka High in Excelsior, Minnesota; St. Alban's in Washington D.C.; Sterling School in  Craftsbury Common, Vermont; Webb-Bell Buckle in Bell Buckle, Tennessee; Germantown Friends School in Philadelphia; and Adams City High in Denver. Major recommendations presented are OB should: not impose its philosophy upon its participating schools; be sensitive to institutional and administrative program readiness; leave program direction/development to school personnel as soon as possible; consider the kind/degree of OB involvement (special vs mainstream); and continue to encourage information dissemination among participating schools. The conclusions presented re: OB impact are OB programs: function as a catalyst; legitimize experiential education; and serve as a vehicle for curriculum reform. (JC)",

Literature in the counseling field was compared with that of OB for purposes of demonstrating the compatibility of OB and counseling objectives in the OB experiential learning situation. Results indicated: guidance counseling and OB objectives were quite similar; counselors have had difficulty fulfilling their objectives in the traditional school setting; the OB program is structured so as to foster fulfillment of  counseling objectives; OB student participants were more positively aware of self and more confident in decision making and social interactions than non-participants; students working with guidance counselors in a program based on OB would become more aware of self and others than those participating in a similarly structured program without the presence of guidance counselors; high school guidance counselors working in a program promoting OB concepts would more likely fulfill their true counseling roles and foster the counseling concepts their profession most desires to promote.

Although it is specifically oriented toward resident outdoor education programs, most of the material has been generalized and can easily be used by a school or resident center in developing an approach to outdoor education. The handbook includes: (1) discussions of sensory awareness, discovery learning, group dynamics and leadership, and the three-legged stool of group function styles of leadership; (2) lesson units for  teaching creative arts, language arts, natural science, math, physical education and recreation, and social science; and (3) samples of forms, lists, and evaluations, i.e., letter to parents, equipment list, health form, permission slip form, a daily program schedule, camp rules and regulations, dining room procedure (family style feeding), school menu list, activity sign-up sheets, student instructors' responsibilities and camp contract, and parent on-site evaluation.

Designed to facilitate easy reference to each of the 12 functions, the guide provides for a self-assessment of the execution of each function as well as an overall evaluation of program management.

Including national energy needs and traditional economic considerations, the model incorporated sociocultural factors influencing development (cultural attitudes and values and demographic characteristics). The sociocultural impacts which were identified included the following three categories: (1) interpersonal, family, and community social problems such as increased crime, alcoholism, divorce, and suicide attempt rates; (2) growing pressures on public services such as schools, housing,  health delivery, and law enforcement; and (3) impacts on the physical environment having quality of life implications. It was suggested that primary impacts would be directly related to population change; the current homogeneous populations would be most affected by population diversification; and mitigating strategies should include improved local planning and quality of life, guaranteed economic benefits (not to be exported), impact aid, and &quot;back end&quot; trust funds.

        "description":"Using interview data collected from 595 subjects living in 5 Utah counties, 2 dimensions of community satisfaction (economic and interpersonal) were identified via factor analysis. Employing a theoretical framework of rural-urban differences, the impact of residence on the two dimensions of satisfaction was tested by regression analysis and found to be considerable. The level of economic satisfaction was highest for urban residents and lowest for rural residents. The satisfaction level of the rural-urban split sample fell between the two extremes. Residence also differentiated interpersonal satisfaction. However, on this dimension the relative rankings were reversed. Again the satisfaction level of rural-urban split residents fell between the two extremes. Employing techniques of  analysis of covariance and multiple-partial correlation, the impact of residence on community satisfaction was maintained when controlling for personal characteristics (age, income, education, family size, and tenure in the community). In view of the findings, it was suggested that &quot;rurality&quot; as a behavioral trait should assume much greater importance and be viewed in conjunction with structural measures, and greater attention should be directed toward residence of origin in conjunction with present residence.

Administered or completed by the 21 teachers involved, the instruments employed were: the Student Content Test; the Student Attitude Survey; the General Classroom Behavior Teacher Rating Scale; the Participant Evaluation; and the Participant Narrative Evaluation. The four teacher centered objectives focused on knowing the what, where, how, and why of outdoor teaching; the three student centered objectives focused on increased comprehension of the natural world,  self, and others; and the program objectives focused on improvement of student communication skills, understanding re: local environment and environmental problems, social responses, and manipulative/motor skills. Results indicated 7 of the 13 objectives were met and 3 were partially met, while 3 of the program objectives were not directly measurable. Since 3 of the 13 objectives were not measurable, it was concluded that the project was nearly 100% successful. (JC)",

Correlating published technical data with that from the five questionnaires, the following were addressed: reasons for 4-H camping; activities preferred to camping; program activities considered important by campers and non-campers; camping costs and decreases in camping membership; reasons for decreases in camp membership and adult camping enthusiasm; youth agents and  the need for technical training re: camping; extension personnel ratings re: camping as a teaching method, a recreation activity, and a 4-H promotion technique. Results indicated: camping members, their parents, and extension agents think camping is a valuable educational experience; agents see camping as a method of teaching social group behavior, individual development, and outdoor subject matter; parents and agents rate camping high as a recreational activity; important needs include expanding adult and member involvement in program development, developing recruitment/promotion methods, studying business management of camp facilities, and educating agents about the technical nature of camping.

Presented by country, the summaries include: organizational procedures; science, geography, and general environmental texts; program scope; special interests; educational problems frequently referred to in the media; educational environmental topics, concepts, courses, and teacher guides; and the texts used at the secondary level. In general, this report indicates that in these countries, elementary school teaching  requires three to four years of preparation at special educational institutes; four to six day field sessions in geography and environmental science during the first and second years of study; and several half-day and one-day field studies in the final year. Recommendations are presented as follows: Ontario student teachers should be involved in a minimum of five days of field studies per year and should receive instruction re: preparation/implementation of day-excursions; and the Ontario Ministry of Education should conduct continuous surveys of foreign educational literature and should encourage school boards to retain or repurchase small rural schools suitable for field studies.

The survey elicited a 67% response to five questions re: environmental education; program emphasis; course requirements; teacher in-service training; knowledge and skill competency levels; and the general state of teacher preparation programs. Results indicated that undergraduate programs for outdoor educators should include: one or two environmental education courses; an adequate understanding of the biological sciences (biology, botany, history, and philosophy) and  environmental and conservation education concepts, history, and philosophy; an integrated or interdisciplinary approach to courses in biology, history, geography, political science, and natural resources; greater emphasis upon elementary teacher preparation curricula. At the graduate level, results indicated teachers needed: a minimum of 30 hours of approved courses; 6 hours of professional education courses; a B average; a 6-year limit on the master's degree; a thesis or research project; specialization in outdoor education and conservation, environmental education studies/problems, or social studies; and field work in various courses.

Chi-squares and corrected contingency coefficients were computed in order to determine any possible association between selected personal factors and farmer participation and the impact of participation upon change. Data revealed: farmers with higher levels of education, larger families, larger farms, higher incomes, organizational membership,  city exposure, and favorable attitudes toward the forums tended to participate more in the radio forums than those without such characteristics; forum members had better knowledge of new agricultural practices, better attitudes toward such practices, and higher adoption rates than non-members; the radio forum program was one of the most effective information sources affecting change. Since it appeared that extension agents tended to concentrate on wealthier farmers, it was suggested that concentration on low income farmers would help mitigate the socioeconomic gap in this developing nation.

The key variables examined were: (1) college plans; (2) parental rapport (regulative parental influence measured by an attitudinal scale designed to elicit youth perceptions of parental rapport); (3) social class origin (normative parental influence as measured by the Duncan Socioeconomic Index for Occupations); (4) scholastic performance level (rank). Findings indicated: parental rapport set the stage for transmission of normative influences which affect educational mobility (especially for  boys), independent of, yet in the same manner as the influence of social class; low class boys lacking strong parental rapport were far less likely to plan to go to college or to rank in the top half of their class, but among girls, the conditional effect of social class and parental rapport was considerably less apparent; the intervening effects of scholastic performance were substantial among boys and girls; the process of educational mobility was firmly woven into the socio-historical context of the times (e.g., during the 60's, the traditional barriers to educational mobility were somewhat mitigated, but by 1974, some barriers appeared to have been reconstructed).

Additionally, a literature review was conducted re: compensatory education, selected aspects of economically disadvantaged children, and outdoor education. The instruments used were: the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control (measurement of the internal-external dimensions); the All About Myself Scale (self-evaluation); and a pre- and post-camp questionnaire developed by the Toledo Public Schools Office of Evaluation. Findings indicated:  although the disadvantaged students had a more external locus of control (life is dictated by fate), the 5-day program caused both groups to become more self-reliant and self-confident; all students had moderately improved in cooperation with others; there was only a moderate transfer of positive values to the classroom; the majority of students liked camp, wanted to return, wished they could have stayed longer, and felt they had made new friends; and the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control appeared more valuable than either of the other two instruments.

Living conditions were specified with reference to city or country in terms of the following general aspects of life: working conditions and content of work, distinctive job tasks, pay, place of work, and opportunity for social/occupational mobility; housing; recreational service; public trade; comprehensive and vocational  training; health services; consumer services; transport and communication facilities; building types and landscape; size and density of population; and pace of life. Results indicated most rural people: favored dominant rural conditions; favored transient urban conditions; did not favor urban dominant conditions; and did not favor rural transient conditions. It was concluded that for these rural people, rural life was of independent value and the attractiveness of transient urban features indicated the desire to transfer modern conveniences to the countryside.

        "description":"Inflation is both a cause and consequence of changes in power and status. Competitive status activities create spiral situations which have an economic correlate. Ultimately, inflation leads to the creation of economically deprived and depressed social groups. Deflation can be achieved to some extent by redistribution of wealth dictated from above, but there remains the danger of conflict unless means can also be found of an equitable redistribution and a devolution of power and status. In some cases, for example, economic deprivation is not mirrored in local estimation by feelings of inferiority. In fact, deprivation may well provide the stimulus for upward mobility in power and status and, consequently, deflation. In New Zealand, there is a kind of class structure wherein the  most deprived groups are not necessarily classes but rather minorities (a Polynesian proletariat, the aged, welfare clients, and many rural communities are not part of the power elite). Since this group is so heterogeneous, it does not constitute a unified power base; moreover, the rural pressure groups are apathetic, lack bureaucratic influence, and are divided. Consequently, New Zealand's urban-centered power structure does not respond to rural needs, but recently, return migrants have been trying to recreate urban services and may become catalytic in the initiation of a new power structure.

Data were collected using the TSOD, the Elementary Science Activities Checklist (ESAC) and the  Science Activities Attitude Sort (SAAS). Results showed that the Combination Group adopted a more inductive/indirect science teaching style than those subjects in the Control Group.

Key features of the program included an open-learning center staffed and equipped with a variety of instructional materials, and a self-paced testing arrangement utilizing a number of repeatable mastery examinations. Characteristics of the 125 students randomly selected for the study were ascertained with a background questionnaire and a physics and mathematics pretest. Achievement in the course was determined by the number of units successfully completed. Questionnaires were administered to determine the average amount of study spent per unit, the values assigned by students to particular instructional materials, and  student attitudes toward the course. Grade aspiration and mathematical skill proved to be the entry factors having the greatest influence on achievement. Learning efficiency was mostly influenced by sex, the student's anticipated difficulty level of the course, and his possession of physics-related concepts and physics-related mathematical skills. Staff and student attitudes toward the course were favorable, and student achievement improved. (Author/MH)",

Data were collected using: (1) concept-process tests, (2) the Science Classroom Checklist (SCACL), (3) the Silance and Remmers Interest Scale, and (4) an instrument to measure student attitudes toward science and scientists (BATSS). For this  study, the Instructional Activities Instrument was developed, piloted, and administered near the end of the year. A direct/indirect score on this instrument was compared to corresponding pre- posttest change scores as measured by the other four instruments. A linear relationship was found between student attitude toward science as a subject and teacher direct-indirectness, and certain instructional methods were found to lose favor with students if frequently used.

Written materials were prepared to teach the concept \"mib\" to students in a remedial chemistry course. One set of materials presented the concept through a programmed text format consisting of 26 frames which presented the student with a figure and asked if the figure represented a mib; feedback for the frames enabled the student to determine the characteristics of the concept. Another set presented a verbal definition of a mib, a single example, and the instruction for the student to draw 26 mibs. A third set included a verbal definition, no example, and 26 illustrations from which the student selected examples of mibs. Materials  were randomly distributed to 150 students. Two days later, students were asked to identify mibs in 20 illustrations and write a definition of a mib. Results indicated that the students who were given a definition developed a different concept than those students who learned the concept through multiple discrimination in the programmed format, indicating that a variety of learning activities are needed for adequate learning of concepts.

The purpose of this document is to transmit to the public one of the products of that project. The grant included several provisions for external evaluation of the program; one of these evaluations being based upon periodic reports  of a visiting committee of several representatives from the fields of education, science, engineering, and industry. During the years 1972-75, the committee periodically observed and reacted to WPI's process of change. The reports contained in this publication are the first WPI-NSF Advisory Committee members' summary assessments of the project.

This document is a comprehensive report of those studies conducted during the years 1972-75. The findings attempt to relate to one key question: Is the WPI PLAN an improvement or a  mistake from the student point of view? This report focuses specifically on five broad areas: (1) competence; (2) self-concepts; (3) attitudes and educational goals; (4) background and ability factors; and (5) perceptions of the school environment and use of time. Results indicate the students are spending more time in activities related to their overall learning, although less of this time is through a direct contact/lecture format than at comparison schools and more in self-governed activities.

The framework is based on Stephen C. Pepper's treatment of six world hypotheses (animism, mysticism, formism, mechansim, contextualism, and organicism) in his book WORLD HYPOTHESES. The study has three major parts. The first is the development of the framework (analytical scheme). The second is its use as a perspective for understanding the relationship between world view and social issues, with special reference to the relevance of this relationship to curriculum concerns. The third is a case-study, demonstrative analysis of a biology textbook, which shows how the analytical  scheme can be used to detect the projection of world views to students in science teaching materials.

The information obtained in this survey provides a description of science teaching practices and selected science teacher characteristics in the United States. Comparisons with data to be obtained in future studies will help decision makers regarding changes taking place in programs, instruction, facilities, and teacher education. The data are organized according to eight regions of the country: Great Lakes, Farwest, New England, Mideast, Southwest, Rocky Mountains, Plains, and Southeast. A total of 276 variables were included in the data-gathering questionnaires. These variables are reported in one of the following six categories:  school organization, scheduling, and enrollment variables; use of resources variables; science course variables; science course improvement project variables; teacher characteristics and background; and teaching practices, preferences, and concerns. The means, standard deviations, and number of responses for each of the variables for each of the regions were computed, and results are given for correlation and multiple regression analyses of selected variables. Both the principal's and the science teacher's questionnaire are included as appendices. (Author/MH)",

Involved were 37 mentally retarded subjects, 62 normal subjects with equivalent chronological ages, and 50 normal subjects with chronological ages equivalent to the mean mental age of the mentally retarded group. Each subject was taught a six level order of classification with an increasing degree of difficulty and abstraction. At each level, the subject was presented with two concrete examples, then asked to select two others from a choice of six. The mentally retarded subjects performed significantly below their mental age and chronological age equivalents. The analysis indicated a strong dependence upon concrete cues and an incapacity of organizing information into  conceptual hierarchical arrays by mentally retarded children. (SL)",

Findings included: (1) career plans are strongly related to parents' level of education; (2) the largest determinant of successful achievement of career plans in science is math ability; (3) the number of females planning science careers has tripled since 1960; (4) underrepresentation of women in science is mediated by factors not related to ability; (5) the measured mean Scientific Potential and the science career plans among blacks and  Spanish surname students are far lower than those of whites and Orientals; and (6) socioeconomic family status related positively to Scientific Potential but appeared to be entirely mediated through abilities that had developed by the eleventh grade.

Chapter 2 describes environmental, organizational, and individual influences on the change process. Chapter 3 discusses change strategies which have been tried and studied and reports on their effects. It summarizes arguments about the efficacy of curriculum development as a change strategy by itself, then describes various models or strategies which have been tried to improve or extend the effects of curriculum  development.

The first quarter of the program was an intensive block of pre-student teaching experiences, including four weeks at an inner city school and four weeks at a suburban school along with campus seminars emphasizing educational philosophy, sociology, and mathematics methods. The second quarter consisted of student teaching in one school. This program (project) operated concurrently with the traditional program (non-project). The project teachers were pre- and posttested during their pre-student teaching (n=52) and posttested during their student teaching experience (n=48). The non-project teachers (n=23) were pre- and posttested  during their student teaching. The tests used were Skeel's CULTURAL ATTITUDE INVENTORY, the TEACHING SITUATION REACTION TEST, and two investigator-constructed instruments. Results showed no significant differences between project and non-project student teachers on the criterion measures. Significant losses on each of the criterion variables were exhibited, with cultural attitudes and reactions to teaching situations showing the greatest negative change. A substantially higher percentage of project than non-project student teachers indicated an increased commitment to teaching and a posttest preference for junior high school teaching. (Author/DT)",

Several areas of needed research with respect to the solution of mathematical problems are discussed. Three elements of Polya's list are identified as having primary importance in the solution process. It is argued that psychological research does not support the usefulness of &quot;devising a plan,&quot; but rather implies that problem solution is facilitated by the restructuring of data.

Four conclusions are drawn: (1) sex-related differences in mathematics achievement are not universal, (2) many fewer females than males study mathematics in eleventh and twelfth grades, (3) the relationship between  cognitive factors and differential learning learning of mathematics by the sexes is unclear, and (4) differential mathematics studying and mathematics achievement by the sexes is at least partially caused by socio-cultural factors mediated through sex-role expectations.

Changes in female access to education both express social transformations and provide an index of future alterations in fertility patterns, family status, marital behavior,  and support for ideals of sexual equality. Women's literacy is affected by prejudice, cultural imperatives, and the absence of relevant role models for women at higher stages of academic life which discourage women from making full use of their intellectual talents. Also, educational expectations for men and women remain unequal largely because marriage is regarded as the ideal career for women while the necessity of earning a living is drummed into males from an early age. The educational prospect for women is rapidly changing, though, as shown by the crumbling of the educational double standard in some countries and by United Nations statistical projections that the situation of girls attending schools is improving rapidly.

        "description":"The premise of this paper is that psychologists need to reconsider the process by which psychological ideas are applied in educational practice. Psychological ideas do not guide educational practice as much as they should because psychologists fail to consider what is happening in the classroom. How a teacher thinks as a psychologist can be identified through the teacher's conceptions of students, teaching approaches, and learning outcomes. Measurement tests developed for the study of a person's perceptions are described in this report for the purposes of identifying teachers' conceptions. Determining why teachers teach and why they adopt new programs will help psychologists understand the process of program implementation before they prescribe programs to teachers. Also, the  reflexivity principle that a teacher is a psychologist and a psychologist is a person--both entities generate psychological ideas and must be accounted for by their ideas--should be applied to psychology theories as well as to communication between psychologists and teachers. This view of teachers should facilitate communication between psychologists and teachers, improve the quality of educational psychology practice, and enrich psychology theory and research.

The author, Chancellor of the California State University and Colleges, suggests that these changes have created a body of students able to understand public questions and make wise economic decisions. A major portion of the report discusses the nationwide problem of economic illiteracy, defined as the inability of citizens to cope effectively with the economic dimensions of public questions and with the economic dimensions of their daily lives. This problem, however, has been counterbalanced by the Economics Education Centers on 14 California college campuses. Included in the report are guidelines for increasing funding and teaching staff at these centers, a  discussion of specific responsibilities of the centers, and a description of the relationship of the centers to local school districts and to other university departments.

Activities connected with two aspects of the model, the family and the future, are presented. The first unit, &quot;The Individual in a Family,&quot; examines the family as a resource for learning about society by studying role identification, pioneer family life, and family norms. The second unit, &quot;The Individual in the Emerging Present,&quot; introduces some simple techniques for thinking about the future and concentrates particularly on future values for today's social studies curriculum.

The first document, the Report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry on Education in the Province of Quebec, 1963-1966 (the Parent Commission Report) presents an overview of the educational system in Quebec. The second document, the Report of Education Commission 1964-66, Ministry of Education, Government of India (The Kothari Commission Report) stresses the cultural, economic, and political forces which influence education in India. Dissimilarities between the Province of Quebec and the Republic of India are enumerated and common political and historical factors of the two areas are compared. Each document is divided into three parts and deals with pedagogical  structure, educational legislation, specific educational achievements, stages and sectors of education, educational reconstruction, and the degree and type of changes which have ensued since publication of the reports. The author concludes that the Parent Commission Report was well received generally but that many of the expectations raised by the report remain unfulfilled. He reports also that, although the Kothari Report was widely discussed upon publication, implementation of its recommendations has been extremely slow due to financial problems and political inertia.

The first dimension, \"perception,\" includes the attention of the observer and his orientation toward the art object. The second dimension, \"cognition,\" includes meditation on the work and an integration process whereby the significance of the work is internalized.

Objectives of the unit are to provide students an understanding that good and evil are a reflection of man's values, a comprehension of modern scientific theories on the innate duality of man's nature, a realization that man must look to himself for definitions of good and evil and accept responsibility for his own actions, and a comprehension of literary works which deal with Western man's belief that he is innately evil or basically good. The study is divided into six chapters. The first chapter presents a 28-item bibliography of books, articles, films, plays, television specials, filmstrips, records, slide  programs, student presentations, simulation games, and teacher readings. The second and third chapters describe specific assignments which investigate the nature of good and evil in man and the foundations of Western society from an historical perspective. Chapter four integrates the study of three novels into the unit and Chapter five provides forms for student evaluation of the project. The last chapter presents student poems and speeches for recitation as well as a list of quotes and poems selected by students. (Author/DB)",

Most of the films are at least one hour in length, and are for use at the senior high school level and above. Specific information is given on duration, color, black-white, distributors, and production dates. For each film a short annotation summarizes the plot and describes special features such as famous directors or unusual precautions in the film's use. Program  models for group showings are suggested, covering topics such as \"The European Experience\" and \"Issues of Conscience for Contemporary Jews.\" Organizations are identified which have published guides to audiovisual materials, and major distributors are listed with addresses.

        "description":"This paper examines West Germany's educational system by discussing the status of K-12 political and social studies education. It was not until the late 1960s that social studies education was introduced as a subject on a wide scale into West Germany's school curriculum. The reason for its introduction and development was the desire to supplement the traditional German conception of a democratic state with elements of American democracy as a way of life. Empirical studies dealing with the results of political education from the 1960s indicate that attitudes regarding more democracy, less prejudice, and a greater readiness to criticize and participate in the political process have not changed much. This is due to several factors: the lack of a central institution which would  determine objectives of social studies education and deal with pedagogical and methodological problems; the lack of special training of many teachers in social studies; and the tendency of many tenured teachers to rely mainly on poorly written textbooks and not to utilize audiovisuals and other supplementary materials. Two reactions to the paper are also included. (Author/RM)",

Three major methodological orientations are discussed: the normative-ontological, empirical-analytical, and dialectical-historical. The author recounts the aims, methods, and basic presuppositions of each of these approaches. Topics discussed include what is and what is not learned in schools, how teachers might talk about political education, how to formulate political and educational ideas theoretically and how to conceptualize them, to what degree theoretical positions can be called political, how theories are discussed in political didactics, and literature on the discussion of political didactics within West Germany. Views of socialist Herbert Marcuse and liberal Karl Popper  are compared in an attempt to show politics as the concrete expression of theories extracted from the humanities and the sciences. Remarks on the paper by Cleo Cherryholmes at Michigan State University and Klaus Hornung at Padagogische Hochschule, Reutlingen, West Germany, are included.

Intended mainly for use in grades 9-10, the curriculum was developed by German social scientists, educators, and students from 1971 to 1973. The curriculum report is presented in two sections. Section I describes the learning package, tells who it is designed for, relates how the problems of party democracy were structured as learning material, and gives examples of how learning objectives and multimedia methods are interrelated. Section II specifies the four motives for the curriculum: party democracy as learning material, the curriculum as a multimedia-based course, the development of an objective-oriented teaching approach, and the party democracy teaching unit as an open curriculum. The first five  chapters deal with the topic of election campaigns, and the last seven chapters focus on the political influence of the citizen over that of political parties in various situations including activities between elections, party platform establishment, and inner party functioning. Specific learning sequences are described. For example, the chapter titled &quot;Election Campaign: A Publicity Spree?&quot; provokes the student into looking more closely at the publicity stunts of an election campaign by testing seven campaign-related statements.

The dual purpose of the study was to assess the rationale behind the TV series and to present an overview of the structure and function of units which have been presented since the program's inception in 1968. As a background, the author describes the didactic structure of the project, the teacher's and student's manuals, the personal teaching medium, the developmental planning of the project, the characteristic features of the social studies project in general, and the specific objectives of the political education unit. The author identifies three conceptual categories which were of major concern to  the curriculum developers: first, existential concepts; second, political dialectic concepts; and third, value concepts. The 25 units produced in 1974-75 are divided into categories of roles and group behavior, membership in social groups, membership in political groups, socioeconomic behavior, and political behavior of groups.

The objective of the study was to synthesize findings of investigative activities into a set of general conclusions from which recommendations could be developed. It was concluded that internal inconsistencies of the plan plus a lack of teacher awareness of its subtle intents have rendered it less useful than it ought to be. The following reasons are given for this weak translation of the Master Plan into programs: lack of time for program development, lack of resources, insufficient consultative services, and teacher incompetence in program development. To counteract these difficulties, nine recommendations are offered, including creation of  an ad hoc task force to reassess and revise the master plan, revision of the documents of the master plan by the Department of Education, and encouragement of teachers to achieve a broader social studies repertoire and a better balance of classroom activities. The final judgment was that the social studies plan is commendable and highly acceptable in its major orientations and should be continued, with certain refinements. Five appendices discuss the background of the study; critique the master plan; provide the survey of teachers, students, and parents; assess the instructional programs; and present observations of site visits.

Life table procedures based on 1970 information show, from a sample of 1,054 women, that slightly more than 25% of separated, divorced, or widowed women had given birth within 48 months of marital disruption. The variables affecting these statistics are described in terms of race, education, parity, and, most importantly, age at time of disruption. A multivariate analysis is used to explore the cumulative prevalance of having experienced intermarital fertility among women over age 30. Four possible explanations for childbirth phenomena are given: \"last chance\" pregnancies that are attempts to keep disintegrating marriages together, unplanned pregnancy, careless contraception, and births  fathered by someone other than the previous or anticipated spouse. It is concluded that the prevalence of childbirth during marital disruption and the social policy issues connected with such births rank it in importance with illegitimacy.

Based on group agreement that energy education should assist students in changing attitudes, altering personal behavior and energy consumption, and developing sound alternatives, the units are categorized by social studies, science, and home economics. The social studies units begin with several activities involving energy vocabulary terms. For example, crossword puzzles and bingo games reinforce definitions. A week-long simulation game based on political decision making creates awareness of energy allocation problems in terms of such issues as litter clean-up, new housing developments, and public swimming pools. The science units focus on the technology of  biological and physical energy systems. Debates about different types of energy use are encouraged, and laboratory projects such as the construction of a solar biogenerator are encouraged. In the home economics units, students learn methods of energy conservation in family life and personal values. Carefully planned house construction, insulation, and use of shrubbery are seen to reduce energy consumption in all seasons. Making hot pads out of a discarded quilt is one of several suggestions for recycling household materials. (AV)",

An anonymous and complex questionnaire was mailed to a random sample of Minnesota's educators. Social and racial attitudes of teachers who had been trained under the mandatory program were compared with those of untrained teachers. Attitudes toward contemporary classroom practices were also measured. Analysis of variance was used to determine the effects of sex, teaching level, and years of teaching experience on teachers' attitudes. Measures were taken to examine three areas of attitudes: (1) identifying and dealing with discrimination, (2) creating positive learning environments, and (3) respecting human diversity. These instruments were designed to measure  the major components of Minnesota's Human Relations Program. The results revealed that the training seemed to have had no effect on teachers' attitudes in the latter two areas. Human relations training did, however, seem to help teachers &quot;identify and deal with discrimination.&quot; Female teachers scored higher on all three measures than males. (Author)",

        "description":"This report describes development of an exercise designed to improve intercultural communication skills. The exercise is intended for use in instructional programs that prepare Americans for work in a foreign cultural environment. When persons of differing cultural backgrounds attempt to communicate with each other, each makes unwarranted, culturally conditioned assumptions about the other person. This makes communication difficult. An exercise was designed to reduce this effect through increased cultural self-awareness. Participants analyze videotapes of staged \"excerpts\" from intercultural dialogs that contain subtle manifestations of cultural influences that are present in American society. The participants learn how to recognize such manifestations. To facilitate this  difficult process, the excerpts are grouped into sequences with each sequence showing several manifestations of the same cultural influence while noncultural influences are varied from excerpt to excerpt. In each sequence, the cultural influence is a common element that is gradually brought into focus. Scripts for 138 excerpts, grouped into 21 sequences, are presented in an appendix. (Author/ND)",

No compulsory topics are suggested, but the rationale, objectives, and areas of inquiry provide a framework within which teachers can work. Based on the assumption that social studies should contribute to the development of individuals who can operate flexibly and responsibly in a changing environment, the guidelines suggest ways in which to form children's patterns of thinking, valuing, feeling, and acting. Three areas of inquiry--personal, social, and environmental--are to be explored through focus questions. They establish problems of concern to the child, stimulate curiosity, and promote concept development. Processes of inquiry and discovery which influence thinking are  explained, and the nature and development of values awareness are explored. Activities and teacher roles which help promote children's emotional responses and positive personal actions are suggested. A variety of resources are seen to be important, and specific learning activities such as role play and field studies are recommended to provide learning contexts. The purposes and methods of evaluation are reviewed and components of unit structure are outlined. (AV)",

First, selected dimensions of simulation game utilization are reviewed. There is agreement that outcomes of simulation games include student motivation, development of decision-making skills, and nonthreatening teacher-student interaction. Less substantiated outcomes are cooperation, empathy, and learning about competition and the role of chance. In a discussion of specific games which might be valuable in affecting political attitudes and values, special attention is given to development of positive political efficacy in students. Research using different  simulation games shows that one game definitely helps develop positive attitudes toward political processes and another influences children from higher economic groups more than lower socioeconomic backgrounds. In a final section, specific games are described which seem especially good for classroom utilization. Some are embedded in curriculum materials; others are freestanding. Sources and costs are given.

Education of immigrant groups, minorities, and handicapped children is discussed. Changes in school building structure from the one-room schoolhouse to the modular open classroom reflect changing theories about the nature of the educative process. History of land grant  colleges and community colleges is traced, and the roles of nonpublic schools and libraries are explored.

The second section, about what happens when a crime is committed, discusses arrest, probable cause, search warrants, searches, evidence, wire tapping, interrogations and  confessions, frisking, personal freedom and rights, bail, prosecution, indictment, preliminary hearing, arraignment, trial, jury, counsel, and appeal. The third section on juvenile law offers information on who are juveniles, juvenile delinquency, noncriminal truancy, criminal delinquency, arrest, juvenile officers, investigation, detention, delinquency petition, and court hearing.

An ethnic person is defined as anyone who decides to identify with and live among those who share the same immigrant memories and values. Ethnic origin, ethnic loyalties, and ethnic considerations play an important role in the political process of the United States. A separate chapter focuses on each of the four minority groups and its role in the process of American politics. Jews, labeled as the shaken liberals, have historically been staunch supporters of the liberal tradition as a unified voter block, but apparent conservative  trends are showing as a reaction to radical liberalism and its support of the Arab nations. The Irish built and dominated political organizations, known as machines, in several cities and their predominance in city politics continues today. Italians were rather slow in getting into politics, but in general Italians are politically conservative, strong American patriots, disunited due to internal identity conflicts, and assimilating rapidly into U.S. society. Truly a silent majority group, Poles have been inactive as an ethnic group, but they indicate recent growth in ethnic identity and pride. (Author/ND)",

        "description":"This curriculum unit for citizenship education is concerned with how American business influences governmental and Congressional economic and tax policies. The unit deals with aspects of business and economic affairs from the perspective of civics and citizenship education. Emphasis is focused on business and political issues and priorities, not budgets and fiscal matters, which bear on public and private finance. It is hoped that students gain a better understanding and working knowledge of business, political science, and economics. The unit examines some of the major relationships between the business community and public spending: government services, allocations of resources and income, cost and benefit determination, and taxes. Related civics questions, such as lobbying and  campaign expenditures, are also addressed. The text includes a case study of the issues and problems surrounding the enactment of a state income-tax law in Illinois. Issues of relationship between city governments and the federal government that involve political and economic pressures are discussed, including the source of the city's right to govern, pressure groups, lobbyists in Washington, and financing elections. A teacher's guide is included which provides some suggestions and opportunities for inquiry, in-depth discussion, additional research, and class discussion of the concepts and questions found in the material.

        "description":"The purpose of this curriculum unit on citizenship education is to enrich the way students think about American Indians by presenting the history of American Indians and their relationship with white Americans. The first chapter discusses the kinds of ideas people have about Indians, especially stereotypes of Indians being wild, red-colored, and uncivilized. The second chapter looks at the prehistory of Indian culture to see the ways in which Indian peoples learned to exploit the land. The excavations of an Indian camp site at Green Point, Michigan, are described, including discussion of the dig, findings, and changes in Indian life from 500-1700 A.D. Chapter three recounts Indian-white relations during 1600-1900 in order to explore what happened when a stone-age culture faced an  acquisitive white culture that was more highly developed and had more resources. The Iroquois Indians in the northeast serve as an example of how Indian life patterns were destroyed by European occupation of America. The last chapter examines the Indian-white contact and the way it has caused recent problems for Indians. Data on employment, income, and death are presented; termination of the Menominee tribe is related; and reservation living is described. (ND)",

        "description":"This guide deals with specific questions and answers concerning discussions and how to lead them. Instructions for group leaders explain effective seating arrangements, group size, and moderating procedures. Benefits of group discussion include increased self-expression, critical-thinking skills, tolerance of others' views, and realization of the complex nature of the &quot;truth.&quot; These benefits develop through group dynamics of interaction, bargaining, compromise, and creativity. Resolving value conflicts and developing policies seem to be the usual purposes of discussion. Chairs should be arranged in a circle or semicircle in order to facilitate open discussion, and group size should be no larger than 15 to 20. Among problems which the discussion leader might encounter are cases of  lagging discussion, domination by a minority, and getting off the topic. Suggestions for avoiding these situations are given. Conclusion of the discussion depends on the meeting's purpose. If agreement on a plan of action is required, one should try to reach concensus rather than alienate some group members. Discussion of how individuals' opinions have been altered may be useful, too. If the issue is to be discussed again, an agenda should be established. (AV)",

        "description":"This kit provides a summary of a scholarly paper, discussion questions, and activities to promote constructive debate between scholars and ethnic and minority groups about the changing role of the neighborhood in American society. The materials focus on the Chicago area, but the issues and problems apply to any urban area. The paper traces the development of the neighborhood in terms of cultural and social interaction among its resident ethnic groups. Conflict of ethnic heritage with the pervading Protestant ethic resulted in confused identity for many people, and the Progressive Movement of the early 20th century encouraged the assimilation of ethnic identity into an American norm. Current urban renewal projects and movement of some classes to the suburbs are creating more  changes in the dynamics of city neighborhoods. Questions to consider include the ability of racial groups to cooperate with ethnic groups, responsiveness of ethnic neighborhoods to bureaucratic politics instead of ward politics, values of ethnic pluralism as opposed to assimilation of ethnicity, and the role of service organizations in neighborhood development. Related activities involve small groups in (1) comparing elementary texts of the 1950s (&quot;Dick and Jane&quot;) with contemporary books that have a multiethnic, blurred sex-role approach or (2) identifying social issues in which ethnic groups have vested interests and role-playing the concerns of those groups.

The paper identifies these women as descendants of immigrant women who still live in large industrial centers of the East and Midwest. Although they are regarded as \"traditional\" and \"passive,\" their role in history shows that they were instrumental in supplementing or providing the only family income and in keeping their families and social organizations strong and active. The feminist movement does not include them, but social changes occurring at the present time are harming their personal identity and self-concept. Their husbands are threatened because some wives  must work fulltime to help meet the cost of living. They are aggressively active about socioeconomic concerns. Questions relevant to the lives of these women include the effect of the Equal Rights Amendment and the diluting effect on ethnicity from participation in the permanent job force. One of the six related activities involves comparing marriage expectations of ethnic women when they were age 20 to what they expect today. (AV)",

Although in the early 1900s the political ideal of \"The Great American Melting Pot\" discouraged bilingual-bicultural approaches, a few schools managed to provide cultural education. German and Polish-American schools are examples. Only in the past two decades has the concept of \"multiethnic education\" influenced the philosophy and curriculum of American schools. Research shows that bilingual and multiethnic programs strengthen children's development and that learning from a child's cultural mode can be destructive. An important concern is that  community groups are able to participate in educational decision making. Among discussion questions are why is the school singled out as the primary social institution for achieving a pluralistic society, and what pros and cons of multicultural education can be identified. Related activities include role-playing the concerns of an immigrant family and educators who promote bilingual programs, and identifying social agents other than schools which promote cultural pluralism.

The objective of the research was to test the assumption that the better an individual's education, the greater his chances of securing a desired and satisfying job. The authors found a general scarcity of specific information on this relationship and employed two sources of related information in their research. First, they analyzed 16 previous studies which dealt with the relationship between the two variables. Second, they examined secondary analyses of nine national surveys of the American work force. Findings for noncollege trained workers indicated that no increment in job satisfaction exists with each succeeding year of education and that no  relationship exists between educational level and job satisfaction. Also indicated was that those persons who had obtained college degrees were consistently more satisfied with their jobs than were other workers. On the basis of these and other findings, the report concludes with a series of six recommendations for future research and policy changes. They include investigating the occupational needs of overeducated workers, reexamining the educational requirements for jobs, and redesigning jobs. The authors developed a social-psychological model to help them understand the relationship between education and job satisfaction. In this model, they reasoned that educational level should be positively related to quality of employment (how good one's pay is, how convenient the hours are, how  interesting the work is).

        "description":"This study examines how schools are organized as social systems and applies concepts and methods used by anthropologists in actual field settings in education. The five objectives established in the study are: (1) develop in-depth ethnographic records of high schools as social systems; (2) diagram the web of networks that make up the social system; (3) chart those relationships that form the networks and determine how their connections are conceptualized; (4) identify and define the learning-related interactions that take place within the system; and (5) identify and codify the rules that define the relationships and structure behavior within and between these networks. This report represents the culmination of a development program in the area of the application of  anthropological theory and techniques to the field of education; the findings are published separately. It is hypothesized that while educators have traditionally looked for rules that are control mechanisms that regulate and regularize relationships between the school and the outside world as well, educators might better find the optimal behavior structure of high schools by observing the behavior the rules produce in the school itself. It can be concluded that the school size is an important factor in socialization. Also, the structure of the school determines the ability of any one person within that school to negotiate a role within the system. It becomes apparent that the usual dimensions of school structure are not appropriate as categories within which to examine the social  organization of high schools. (SK)",

It is intended to help prepare graduate students in anthropology and in educational administration as well as other researchers and practitioners to view schools as social systems. Another objective is to explicate an approach and a methodology for problem-solvers and policy-makers. The design of this training program represents a collective effort on the part of the field research team in: (1) selecting from the field notes and research findings of the study those concepts and materials most valuable to educational decision-makers; (2) developing a conceptual and curricular format that would make these  materials both useful and interesting; (3) setting the materials within a problem-solving framework since this is the essence of the decision-making process; (4) field-testing and assessing the materials with practicing teachers; and (5) refining and redesigning the materials as a self-contained package. The materials are described in such a way that the student proceeds to look at the school as a social system in much the same way he would in a field study--beginning at the macro-level of the school as an organization and then gradually working down to study elements of that system in specific detail.

The volume entitled \"Readings,\" not yet published, includes articles designed to be read concurrently with each section of this volume. A major objective of the study was the development of training materials to be used in preparing anthropologists and educators to use field research as a means of problem identification and data gathering in education. Three high schools were examined as social units that operate according to an observable code of rules. The high schools were analyzed at three levels: (1) the sturctural level at which the whole school organization  is taken as the unit of analysis; (2) the level or role behavior at which generalized patterns of behavior are taken as the unit of analysis; and (3) the level of individual strategies in response to the pattern of social constraints described at the previous two levels. Fifty-three incidents of classroom behavior were examined to help draw conclusions regarding schools as social systems. It is concluded that there will always be an informal network of power relations in the school that are not named in the formal organization chart. Secondly, there is always the possibility that one role will be in conflict with another role thus causing limitations on roles. Finally it is in the institution's interest to formalize emergent roles and incorporate them into the structure of the school.  (SK)",

The institutional structures and the individuals interact. As student teachers participate in the daily activities and events of preparation, they construct meanings about the tasks and responsibilities of teaching. The social distribution of professional knowledge is shown as having three dimensions: the inferential structures students develop as they participate in teacher education: the ways in which sacred knowledge is maintained, legitimated, or rejected; and the sentiments embedded in the work activities student teachers are called upon to do. These three dimensions are considered  in relationship to the possible ethical consequences of certain actions educators take in teacher education. Three further methodological considerations are discussed: the functional vocabulary and specific actions of students; the functioning vocabulary students needed as they proceed through their teacher preparation program; and a vocabulary of motive, which may or may not vary from the ideal types. Variations in perspectives should be expected and identified. (JMF)",

        "description":"The Division of Teacher Education (DTE) at Indiana University, Bloomington, explored ways in which the university could better serve American public schools under a program funded by the United States Office of Education. This document, the final report, includes a description of activities and evaluation efforts, and recommendations for future program activities. The original proposal set forth a plan to identify and ameliorate six conditions requiring reform in institutions of higher learning in order to enhance the quality of teacher education and thereby better serve schools, students, and communities. They are: (1) the over-bureaucratization of schools of education and the low priority assigned to the education of teachers; (2) the isolation of schools of education and the  low priority assigned to the education of teachers by other academic units at the university; (3) the separation of university and school level experiences for the prospective teacher; (4) the divorce of teacher education from the real world; (5) the failure to develop strategies, tactics, and materials that have a cumulative effect on the development of teacher education; and (6) the temporary nature of innovations and experiments. Pursuant activities involved Indiana University in a partnership with communities and local educational agencies in reforming teacher education and, subsequently, teacher behavior in schools; up-grading the priority assigned to teacher education programs within the institution; and providing for the development of a wider range of strategies, tactics, and  materials that would have a cumulative effect on teacher education programs and lead to the development of theories about teacher education. Although evaluations were conducted at all levels throughout the program, this final report examines the effectiveness of the DTE in meeting its goals. Appendices cover: development of the DTE; preparation options in teacher education; description of evaluation activities; the mission of the school of education; and activities of the dissemination component.

The information contained in these reports consists of (1) the counties in which the student teachers were assigned and (2) the number of student teachers assigned in each, classified according to the student's area of specialization. The data is compiled and compared on a yearly basis in an effort to ascertain current trends in Florida's system of teacher education. Information for the 1974-75 placement pattern is presented in  this document through discussion, the display of over 40 tables, and geographic distribution maps.

Among its chief characteristics, the model: (1) describes what occurs during instructional activities in regard to values clarification and moral reasoning behavior as aspects of affective development; (2) extracts and describes internal cognitive process operations in terms of observable patterns of student verbal behavior; and (3) focuses on the appropriate categories and patterns of language  consistent with the reasoning processes used in clarifying values and in the development and use of moral reasoning, rather than on the substance or content of a value or moral choice.

What was learned? What was expected? What was found?) followed by recommendations for other programs. Section I is an introductory essay entitled, &quot;Maine Teacher Corps, A Viable Alternative.&quot; Section II discusses the selection process of interns and team leaders--the processes and criteria used--and their implications. Section III, &quot;Program Structure,&quot; discusses grades and credits, and other information used in their place. Section IV describes the instructional program of interns in terms of content, supervision, and evaluation. Section V, &quot;In-Service Program,&quot; focuses on the dimensions of the Teacher Corps'  interactions with in-service teachers. Section VI discusses the host university's relationship to the Teacher Corps in light of the University of Maine's statement that Teacher Corps is a way to provide new input into the staff, implement an experimental model, explore alternatives within the school, and provide financial assistance. The appendices offer a sample Teacher Corps transcript including a list of minimal competencies attained by graduates of the Teacher Corps program. (MM)",

If teachers can be trained to counter authoritarianism, they can begin to break the vicious circle of people growing up in an authoritarian culture, becoming authoritarian themselves, and molding their institutions and overall behaviors in an authoritarian fashion. This study was designed to examine the effect of a treatment on the authoritarian level of a group of education students from highly authoritarian societies. Experimental and control groups of graduate students at the American University of Beirut were studied to determine specific elements in the learning-teaching process that would produce greater tolerance among learners. Such elements would then become primary components in a regular  program of instruction offered to a group of learners to produce the desired effect. The findings reported confirm that authoritarianism may be reduced through learning experiences specially designed for this purpose, but not through general education. Questions for further study include the permanence of change in attitude and whether different treatment is required depending upon the degree of authoritarianism demonstrated. The findings of the study can be implemented in both preservice and inservice training programs. (JMF)",

The six operating projects are presented and analyzed in a comparative fashion that highlights critical areas of the programs: shared goals and objectives, governance and administration, staffing patterns, educational and curricular emphasis. There are changes needed in all facets of education, particularly as it relates to troubled youth. Some critical elements of these changes are examined including: educational content/curriculum; learning  and teaching techniques; interdisciplinary curricula and collaborative decision-making; and local education agencies. The unique concept of the community in the Youth Advocacy Projects is discussed as a support system and in its relationship with the criminal justice system. The final section of the report describes a number of issues related to education and troubled youth and cites some examples where the issues are being dealt with. The issues are: curriculum, teacher training, alternative school structures, integration of human services, and interorganizational cooperation. (JMF)",

Teaching is seen as meeting a basic criterion of a profession: that acts performed by members of the group deal with matters of life and death. However, several reforms are needed in public schools as well as in teacher education to meet this important responsibility. Twelve reforms in public schools are outlined; and the recommendations and assertations of the CEPT Report are discussed. These latter focus on the nature of professions and where teaching stands among them; career-long designs for teacher education; governance; individual and institutional quality controls; and resources. Starting  with this basis, the future of teacher education -- new directions toward human services education--is discussed. The changing society demands a new kind of professional to concentrate on long-term and environmental effects of educational and social policies and programs. There is a need in human service agencies for trainer-teachers to design programs, teach, and evaluate educational progress for other human service professionals. The new preparation demanded for this is discussed as is a proposed new strategy for reform and a new view of accountability. (JMF)",

        "description":"The purpose of this practicum was to show the development and evaluation of a multi-unit elementary school (MUS-E) using Individually Guided Education. As an organizational structure capable of permitting planned change. MUS-E provides for the growth of its students on an individual basis, provides in-service for its teachers, involves the public as an active partner in the education process, and places responsibility for progress on the child. Activities and evaluations relating to the school years 1973-74 and 1974-75 are presented and compared. The data indicate multiple areas of positive growth--more community involvement, less absenteeism, fewer discipline problems, and a more positive attitude toward school by all parties. Teacher participation, attitude, and work habits  have resulted in a positive application of the program. Appendices include a proposal for the implementation of Individually Guided Education (IGE) at Bethlehem Elementary School, a memorandum of commitment between the University of Virginia and the Henrico County Public Schools, a workshop evaluation form, student, teacher, and parent opinionnaires, a teacher observational scale, detailed presentations of IGE instructional processes, various evaluation instruments, public relations materials, and a bibliography.

        "description":"The experiment described was designed to evaluate the possible effects on students in a small seminar of an evaluation system in which students were freed from some of the pressures of the conventional grading system and allowed to participate in the grading process, and to determine whether such participation would affect the acquisition of course content and attitudes of students toward that course. One of three randomly selected seminar groups was chosen to be the experimental group in which the grading process was altered. Pretesting was done covering course content to establish relative equality among the groups. An analysis of variance revealed no statistically significant difference in the group that constructed its own tests and assigned its own points for seminar  participation and the two control groups, which were graded by a more traditional method. Chi Square analyses were performed on the attitude data revealing no significant differences in the groups on attitudes toward unit quizzes, course grading, or small group seminars. Although statistical analysis indicated no significant differences in attitudes in the groups, the study revealed that students felt the experience was valuable in learning to compose valid test questions, that it freed them from memorizing irrelevant details, released them from tension, and allowed a more receptive mindset for hearing and listening as well as allowing for increased teacher-student communication, rapport, and appreciation.

        "description":"This report examines how the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) process might be utilized in an institutional research format to bring about future formalized assessment and planning in undergraduate and graduate teacher education. With the focus on the recent NCATE reaccreditation process at the University of Michigan's School of Education, this report first examines the accreditation process an institution undergoes in order to determine the quality of its programs, and second, develops a framework and rationale whereby the information compiled for accrediting purposes can be further utilized by the institution to evaluate itself. The data contained in an NCATE study represent institutional information that can be analyzed further to serve as the  basis for decision-making and for the evaluation of teachers. The objective of institutional research is to utilize data or manage information so that it can be evaluated and used to plan institutional change. The differences, then, between accreditation and institutional research lie in the fact that accrediting institutions such as NCATE are mainly concerned with evaluating procedural data and comparing it with prescribed and established standards, whereas institutional research is a way of gathering data on the various components of an institution and then managing or analysing it in order to make a realistic design concerning the present or the future of the institution. NCATE hopes that the data accumulated through its accreditation process will in the future be used for  institutional research and self-study. (MM)",

This document reports the organizational crisis that faced the Windsor Minor Hockey Association, Ontario, Canada, and the assistance it received from SIR/CAR. The hockey association seemed to be at cross purposes to its avowed goals. The organization was structured as a professional organization although its goals of participation and enjoyment were consistent with those of an amateur sports organization. SIR/CAR guided the hockey association into a looser structure with a decreased emphasis on winning and  increased emphasis on participation. Guidelines were established that reflected the enjoyment and gratification needs of an amateur sports organization. The implications of this restructuring are that if an organization aspires to maintain the avowed goals of an amateur sports program, it must structurally remain within the prescribed guidelines and regulations for an amateur sports group; otherwise conflict and eventually crisis will appear.

The researchers utilized the SAW method for diagnosis. SAW consists of [S]eeing by audiovisual and personal observation monitoring; [A]sking by semi-directed, focused interviews; and [W]ritten opinionnaires. Results indicated problems within the organization stemming from ambiguity of goals and outside pressures. Data collected from players indicated problems stemming from  differences in age and low morale due to dropouts. The interviews and questionnaires depicted an amateur sports direction for the organization; however, monitoring by media and personal observation indicated the organization was heading in a professional athletics direction. Overall, the results revealed that the players want to operate as an amateur sports association and revisions must be made in the structure of the association to accommodate the players' needs and desire for amateur status.

        "description":"Case studies have shown that, while only a limited number of research-based products or processes are available for introduction into teacher education programs, involvement of trainers and teachers in originating and developing innovations is necessary if they are to become widespread and influential. Because innovation requires changed behavior of an existing population, two viewpoints are involved. The Research and Development (R and D) people may view the process of change as one replacing methods and products; insiders may view it as replacement of personnel. For an R and D product to be considered as a policy rather than an experiment in a curriculum requires the assent and cooperation of those in power, the tenured faculty. Training conducted by faculty tends to be  resistant to the inclusion of R and D products because they are strange concepts. Actual involvement of these professionals in curriculum development with the R and D group is necessary if the products are to become more than ancillary components of training. Acceptance rationale also differs between groups. The R and D approach is that the product is discrete, identifiable (and replicable), predictable in outcome, serves an identifiable need, and is documentable. The teacher educator program tends to have a different criteria--does it fit into existing philosophy, does the faculty want to do it, is the student population interested in or need the product, is a job available for those so trained, and, perhaps most important, is the money available. Since eighty percent of a budget is  devoted to salaries, and sixty percent or more faculty are tenured, one returns to this group as the key impact point, the key to survival and growth of an innovation.

Questions covered included: How does the government assist in preventive medicine programs? What are the gaps in current health care and delivery systems? How can current legislation in this field be better implemented? The early periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment program (EDSDT) is essential to good health care for children. Low-income children need this service, and good community health centers are needed to implement this preventive health program. The Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) is responsible for overseeing state operations and enforcement of this program. Testimony indicates the job is not being done well. There is inadequate  funding through medicaid; there is a lack of rapport and communication between HEW and state officials; and eligibility of children for the program is hard to determine. There are wide gaps in execution of the program as intended by congress, and there is a lack of proper administration by HEW.

H. Ling. However, at the elementary education level, a change towards informality, discovery learning, learning environments, and individualized instruction was beginning to develop in music, art, and physical education. Known as &quot;Movement Education' (ME), it was introduced into England in the thirties by Rudolph Labun as Modern Education Dance, mainly to women physical education and dance teachers. Resistance to the new ideas by male teachers existed because of the links to dance, women teachers, and women's physical education colleges. Gradually, attitudes changed and now,  in the seventies, it is acknowledged that movement education can be presented as a total approach to physical education. Arguments still persist, but present approaches in physical education teaching stress respect for individual differences, individualized instruction, and problem-solving experiences. Much remains to be done in the fields of games, play, and theories of learning and teaching. The major goal should be to encourage children to become feeling, sharing, concerned individuals with a sense of worth, self-direction, and knowledge of what is essential to their survival. (MB)",

Four stages of growth are identified: primitive, primary, stable, and elaborate. Both the historical and modern organizations of the CIAU are analyzed using these stages to show the development and decline of the organization. This pattern is used to substantiate the theory of cycles of conflict and patterns of organizational growth and development developed by Ralph M. Stogdill and the Ohio State Leadership Institute.

The paper presents: (1) discussion of pertinent aspects of sport, dance, and drama; (2) examples of comparative studies completed in games, dance, and theater; and (3) suggestions for further studies. Some points of discussion include: (1) the importance of realizing that a performance (sport, dance, or theater event) requires the participation of many who are not performers; (2) actual performances are complexly orchestrated with several things happening simultaneously; (3) the performance reflects the culture; and (4) the performers willingly  suffer for the performance. Suggested foci for further studies include altered states of consciousness in performance, and the changing of traditional forms of sport, dance, or theater into commercially evaluated \"airport art.\" (MM)",

        "author":["Sacco, James M."],
        "description":"This study investigated the effectiveness of a team supervisory conference in eliciting pupil divergent thinking in a trial lesson. The first hypothesis was that pupils who are asked divergent questions by student teachers who have had a team supervisory conference prior to the lesson will express more divergent thought in a ten-minute lesson than those questioned by student teachers who have not had such a conference. The second hypothesis was that a student teacher who has had a team supervisory conference between a practice and a criterion divergent questioning lesson will ask significantly more divergent questions in the criterion lesson than those who did not have such a conference. The subjects were 24 female University of Maryland (Baltimore County) elementary student  teachers and 240 elementary pupils from neighboring school systems. Students and student teachers were divided into either a control group or a treatment group. All student teachers were given an assignment to prepare one 10-minute lesson that would elicit divergent thinking from a group of five pupils. Student teachers in the treatment group then participated in a supervisory conference with a teacher center coordinator and a supervising teacher. All the student teachers--both treatment and control--then taught the same lesson (criterion lesson) to a second group of pupils. The lessons of both groups were videotaped. The first hypothesis--that the pupils of student teachers who had participated in a supervisory conference would produce more divergent thinking in the criterion lesson--was  confirmed; the second hypothesis--that the supervisory conference would increase the number of divergent questions asked by student teachers--was not confirmed.

        "description":"To determine whether preservice teachers would demonstrate a significant change in level of teacher enthusiasm after participating in a training intervention on teacher enthusiasm, and whether these same preservice teachers could maintain the increased level of teacher enthusiasm three weeks after termination of training, twenty preservice teachers were randomly assigned to either an experimental training group or to a control group. The experimental group was trained to increase their level of teacher enthusiasm through class discussions, peer teaching, and microteaching with public school children. Eight teacher behaviors were identified as descriptors of teacher enthusiasm: (1) vocal delivery; (2) eyes; (3) gestures; (4) movements; (5) facial expression; (6) word selection;  (7) acceptance of ideas and feelings; and (8) over-all energy. Data were gathered on the eight teacher characteristics by videotaping the experimental and control groups before and three weeks after the training intervention. Two trained observers rated each of the video tapes on a 5-point scale without knowledge of which preservice teachers were in the experimental or control groups or whether the taping was pre- or post-training. Analysis of the data indicates that the overall performance of the experimental group significantly increased after training and that each of the variables contributed significantly to this increase. The results, therefore, support the theory that it is possible to train a preservice teacher to increase his level of enthusiasm as described by the eight  variables. (MM)",

        "description":"This study investigates the nature and stability of verbal behaviors for different contextual purposes in classrooms with varying structures, from traditional to open, utilizing the RCS interaction analysis system modified to code for contextual purpose (cognitive, procedural, social, affective, and behavioral). Eighteen observations were made in each of six primary classrooms following a schedule that controls for situational factors, e.g., subject matter, period of day. Results indicate consistency within teachers in the relative frequency with which verbal behaviors are used, both globally (without regard to contextual purpose) and for specific contextual purposes. In contrast, a wide range of variability was found in the total number of adjusted tallies per category both  globally and for specific contextual purposes from one observation period to the next. The nature of verbal interactions for different contextual purposes varied according to the subject matter during the observation period as well as according to the structure of the classroom. The method used in this study demonstrates the increased precision in delineating differences in verbal interaction for differing contextual purposes, different subject matter areas, and different types of classrooms. Nevertheless, because of the complexity of interactions in the classroom and because of the amount of irretrievable information lost in the coding process, the usefulness of this type of verbal interaction analysis system for investigating teacher effectiveness is called into question.

It used knowledge as the principle by which a college of education should be organized in order to maximize effectiveness and elicit the best efforts from its staff. In the search for this principle or organization, some criteria were first established: (1) that the principle would imply a logically consistent organization; (2) that the principle would generally improve the efficiency and effectiveness of colleges of education; (3) that the principle would not be restricted by departmental prejudices, traditional biases, or other interests of pressure groups within the college of education; (4) that the principle would permit professional individuality, but preclude exploitation of a college of  education by the individual; and (5) that the principle would assure the integrity of a college without submerging and/or stifling the creativity and responsible freedom of the professional staff. Out of the process of inquiring about what principle would satisfy the criteria, the concept of knowledge emerged as a principle of curriculum organization. It was then established as an organizational principle through a process of asking a series of analytical and empirical questions. An example of organization according to the principle of knowledge is provided. (MM)",

Specifically, this module focuses on the following terminal objective: satisfactorily identify and order the evaluation priorities in a given school situation. This terminal objective will be tested by the pre-assessment exercise, a group discussion, and the post-assessment exercise. The module also presents a number of activities which will assess and develop the participant's ability to accomplish the enabling objectives that underlie the terminal objective. Some of these will be paper, pencil, and reading exercises; others will be practical, field-based activities. The  terminal objective assumes that the participant accomplishing it will be able to: (1) accumulate the necessary data for identifying evaluation priorities; (2) specify evaluation priorities; and (3) compare and order evaluation priorities. The self-instructional materials contained in this module packet will lead to the accomplishment of these objectives, or outside suggested readings may be used. (MM)",

        "description":"The City University of New York Competency Based Teacher Education Project (CUNY-CBTEP) in Special Education studied Modularization, focusing on the variables in the instructional setting that facilitate learning from modular materials for a wide range of students. Four of the five modules for the training of special education teachers developed for this study were submitted to a field testing extending from the summer of 1974 through the fall of 1975. At some field test sites, instructors made extensive modifications or adaptations of the module materials. At others instructors made moderate changes to accommodate students' needs, or made no changes at all. On the college level, modules were usually incorporated as additional or alternative assignments, and at the inservice  level, modules served as the basis for (1) instructor input with a group of teachers within a school, (2) independent group work within a school, and (3) independent study. The field testing and evaluation was designed to test the effectiveness of the modules as learning tools in the above varying contexts and to provide data on any needed revisions prior to widespread distribution of the modules. Results indicate that the modules have done an effective job in the development of the competencies specified in the module objectives, particularly when instructors modified the materials to meet the needs of the students and added activities that provided experiences with the handicapped.

A number of questions need to be considered before making decisions concerning the development and improvement of such instruments: (1) At what level of specificity are the competencies to be measured stated? (2) In what context (symbolic, simulated, or work) is the demonstration of the competency to be measured? (3) How often and at what points are preservice teachers to be measured? (4) Who is to be involved in measuring the performance of preservice teachers? (5) Will the measurement of competence be formative, summative, or both? (6) How much time will be required for measurement? and (7) What is to be measured? The  instruments now available to measure teacher behavior fall into two categories: (1) instruments used by school systems to rate personnel and instruments developed by colleges and universities to measure performance in student teaching; and (2) instruments that have been constructed primarily for use in research. Four types of instruments suggested for measurement of preservice teacher competencies discussed are: systematic observation; rating scales, interviews, and teacher products. (MM)",

        "description":"Current classroom problems affecting teachers within the potential teacher education population of Indiana University Northwest (IUN) were studied as part of a continuing effort to update the state of the art as it relates to the changing problems of teachers in the classroom. A review of past research suggests seven problem areas to be studied: class size; insufficent time for rest and preparation; insufficient clerical help; finding time for individualized work with students; inadequate instructional materials; discipline; and problems with parents. In order to assess the status of these classroom problems, 246 questionnaires were distributed to graduates of IUN (104 were returned) with instructions to rate these seven problems as &quot;major,&quot;&quot;minor,&quot; or &quot;no problem&quot;. The  questionnaire included an open response section that requested teachers to list three other problems they encountered not listed in the above seven. Teachers were also asked to rate their confidence in seven instructional areas: mathematics, language arts, science, social studies, music, art, and physical education. Selected demographic information was also collected. According to the results, major problems facing teachers relate to time and interpersonal relations. The information collected regarding confidence revealed they did not feel confident to provide adequate instruction in science. The majority of teachers focused their attention on the problem of finding time for individualized work with students; however, analysis of their suggestions indicated that the teachers have no  better ideas for solving the problem than anyone else. (A sample questionnaire is included.) (MM)",

The model is based on a collaborative approach to inservice education, in which the teacher is able to draw on the resources of an institution of higher learning, a local education association, and a teacher association for design, implementation, and evaluation of his/her inservice model. The purpose of this document is to describe the preparation and present state-of-the-art of the cost benefit model for the inservice project. The term &quot;cost&quot; signifies the specific dollar value that might be assigned to an activity or material. &quot;Benefit&quot; and &quot;liability&quot; indicate value judgments placed on institution, training, environment, or  programs of interest to teachers and/or administrators, for which a dollar amount cannot be assigned. The document (1) reviews the cost, benefit, and liability model for the individual teacher contracts and discusses budget and funding sources; (2) reviews cost, benefits, and liabilities for the inservice consortium, with a discussion of its fundings and functions; (3) reports on some initial cost studies in which the models have been applied; and (4) comments on the application of cost studies to the WWSC/TC model. Three appendices are included: (1) a sample teacher contract; (2) a catalogue description for a problem-solving practicum in action research to identify specific needs of a target school; and (3) a general fund expenditure classification for the model.

The first article traces the development of the teacher center movement in Maryland, a cooperative venture by the Maryland State Department of Education, the Montgomery County School System, and the University of Maryland at College Park, which began in 1964 and continues to the present. Research findings about center operations at the University of Maryland are reported in relation to the basic question of whether or not there are observable differences between teachers who participate in  the centers and those who do not. The role of the teacher center coordinator is seen as one of a catalyst, motivating the educators in the center until all objectives are achieved. Inservice programs in one teacher education center involving a junior and senior high school are described, and principles concerning inservice education derived from the center's activities are identified. A model for the articulation and integration of personnel needs through collaborative efforts of several centers in the inservice program is also presented. Other articles discuss the ways various centers operate on an extension of the concept of management by objectives; a center is viewed from the vantage point of an educator assuming various positions in the center; and a representative year's program is  detailed. The final article addresses four functions for a center and reflects upon the future of the teacher center movement. (MM)",

In recruiting and hiring of new personnel, a survey of present employees with regard to the status of women and minorities in respect to numbers, types of job, and level of employment will give an idea of the organization's standing as an equal opportunity employer. If a deficiency exists, efforts in searching for new employees should be conducted so that minority groups receive information of available positions. Interviewing teams should be constituted which give representation to women and minority groups, and interviewing procedures developed which reduce as much as possible the personal biases of committee members. Decisions should  be made on the basis of: (1) knowledge and experience factors; (2) intellectual factors; (3) motivational factors; and (4) personality factors. Contracts should be the same for all individuals possessing equal qualifications and employed in the same or similar roles within a given institution. Since the individual should be the manager of his/her own career, he/she should examine areas of career advancement such as promotion and educational growth, and career opportunities to ascertain that intramural-recreational sports departments and institutions of higher learning are complying with and promoting affirmative action and equal employment opportunities.

        "description":"Competition is evident within all aspects of life, among all types of people, and throughout the recorded history of mankind. Sport as both an educational process and profession is no exception. In recent years, however, the concept of competition has been increasingly subjected to examination by both educators and participants. What is competition? Can competition be used as an educational tool? Is there more than one type of competition? Can competition be abused? Three distinct types of competition have been identified: direct, indirect, and cooperative. Also identified are the problems of inclusion-exclusion, zero-negative-positive sum game theory, and aggression reinforcement. Each form of competition possesses both positive and negative aspects; each can be used as an  educational tool; and each is vulnerable to abuse. Failure to understand the various concepts of competition and their attendant problems may result in the perpetuation of programs premised on a competitive theory that alienates rather than attracts the population to be served. Continued misapplication of competitive theory may lead to further erosion of sport program support, whereas intelligent understanding and careful application may possibly result in structural changes but may also generate new and increased program support.

        "description":"The modern history of sports medicine is chronicled in a discussion of the first writings in English on sports medicine. What may have been the first writing in English is a section on first aid in the ENCYCLOPEDIA OF SPORT, published in England in 1898. It describes injuries commonly sustained in angling, boxing, cricket, cycling, football, hunting, lawn tennis, mountaineering, rowing, and shooting. Several other books were published in Europe in other languages during the years before the first World War, including the first comprehensive work on sports injuries in a single volume by one author. In 1931, two books on sports medicine appeared in English--INJURIES AND SPORT, A GENERAL GUIDE FOR THE PRACTITIONER and TRAINING, CONDITIONING, AND THE CARE OF INJURIES. INJURIES AND  SPORT by Charles Brehmer Heald is divided into two parts. The first deals with the process of the repair of injuries, the general principles of diagnosis, first aid, electrotherapeutics, physio-therapeutics, factors modifying recovery, and complications of injuries. He advocates one method of treatment throughout--anodal galvanism, the application of mild direct currents to the injury. The second part of the book deals with the injuries classified according to the body parts affected. Walter Meanwell's book, TRAINING, CONDITIONING, AND CARE, is brief, more oriented to training, and not comprehensive in its discussion of injuries. He devotes considerable space to diet, and particularly to debunking many beliefs commonly held by coaches and athletes at the time. In 1939, Dr. August  Thorndike, Jr., published ATHLETIC INJURIES: PREVENTION, DIAGNOSIS, AND TREATMENT, thought by most to be the pioneer publication in the field, in the United States. (MM)",

Dance rituals identifying with a deity predate written history and have persisted in all cultures up to modern times. Individual and group ecstacy induced by dancing enacted man's relationship to God as well as interpreting God to people of widely different cultural backgrounds. The ancient pagan rite of dancing as a religious expression was so deeply ingrained in the human need for vivid and enthusiastic experience that it was carried into the very early Christian church. Gradually, as church organization and authority grew, it became formalized and at length repressed. While spontaneous dancing remains a part of ritualized religion in primitive cultures, with the exception of a few minor cults it is no longer  a feature of western religions. Recently, however, interest in the dance incorporated into liturgical worship has revived. It presently takes the form of structured religious interpretation by professional dancers. (JD)",

        "description":"America's approach to physical education and exercise in the schools is reflected in the contributions of two 19th-century physical educators named Allen, one of fairly major importance and one of less importance. Perhaps the most significant contributions to the development of school physical education were made by Nathaniel Topliff Allen at the &quot;Allen School&quot; in West Newton, Massachusetts. The Allen School's undertakings in the areas of exercise and sport reflected the educational practice of its founding fathers-Horace Mann, Cyrus Pierce, and Nathaniel Allen, whose collective wisdom, coupled with the physical presence of Dioclesian Lewis and Catharine Beecher and the interpretations of physical culture expressed by Dr. William A. Alcott, promulgated an educational philosophy  that provided a school setting progressive in spirit and liberal in outlook. The Allen School existed for nearly 75 years, during which time it showcased the most progressive, innovative, and educationally sound approaches to the subject of school physical education yet seen in the Western hemisphere. The other Allen in the development of physical education was Mary Allen, the proprietor and director of the Allen School of Gymnastics in downtown Boston. In noting Miss Allen's system of exercise and her contributions to physical education in nineteenth century Boston, school officials stated that Mary Allen maintained a large and well-appointed gymnasium, where she put into practice a system of gymnastic training having many original and useful features. Others have felt that her gymnastic  program was not particularly new or innovative for its time and that it borrowed heavily on the systems of Ling, Dioclesian Lewis, and Delsarte. (MM)",

In the late 1800's football was played in the Territory of New Mexico with contests between &quot;white&quot; universities and government Indian schools. These games contributed to the development of football, introducing strategic elements for the most part devised by the Indians. Though the game as played in the West was to a large extent the same as the East, innovations were brought to it that were characteristically western in nature. The rough individualism of western society brought color and excitement to the game. Though similar to the English game rugby, football developed its own rules. Eventually the extreme  roughness of the game threatened its existence. In the face of this threat the National Collegiate Athletic Association was organized and laid down new rules controlling the brutality of football and forming it into a game emphasising skills and strategic play.

Dr. Lewis thought in terms of preventing illness and maintaining bodily strength and health through physical fitness. His &quot;new gymnastics&quot; were based on programs of exercise movements. Employing light equipment suitable for use by women and children, he created a system of calisthenics centered on the development of flexibility and grace of movement, rather than strength. These gymnastics could be performed in the school room and did not require large areas of space. He founded the Normal Institute for Physical Education in Boston where teachers of physical education were trained. His students spread out through the United States and foreign countries introducing  the philosophy of a sound mind in a sound body to students and other teachers. One student of his, Adele Parot, carried his teaching to California. She was instrumental in bringing about California's legislation for mandatory physical education in the state's public schools, the first legislation of its type in the United States. (JD)",

        "description":"During its century and a half history, baseball has been given continued impetus by the development of new technologies in communication--the telegraph, the sports page, the radio and television. Perhaps the most important in the initial spread of baseball throughout America was the railroad. The completion of the Union Pacific Railroad in 1869 made possible a western tour by the Cincinnati Red Stockings, during which games were played in St. Louis, San Francisco, Sacramento, and Omaha. The impact of the tour is debatable--it did create a heightened fervor for the sport in the short run, but the overwhelming superiority of the Red Stockings may have slowed the development of baseball competition on the west coast, where sailing, horseracing, billiards, footracing, velocipede  riding, and cricket claimed much larger followings. The tour's most prolonged impact may have been in Carson City and Virginia City, Nevada. A baseball rivalry had already grown between these two mining communities and was intensified by the impending arrival of the Red Stockings, invited to play by the Carson City team. However, the Red Stockings traveled straight through to Omaha, and the Carson City team, frustrated but with enthusiasm undampened, was left to continue its local rivalry with Virginia City. (MB)",

        "description":"During the early decades of the twentieth century, there was a gradual shift from educational sports as a forum for non-risk individual participation to team and coach-centered endeavors where an emphasis on winning existed. That shift reflected social changes in the United States as American society itself became highly structured and organized for efficiency during the 1920's and 1930's. In the 1920's, the Detroit school system, under the direction of Vaughn Blanchard, introduced a program of non-adult participation in athletic events. That is, during an athletic contest, students organized, played, and managed the event. No adult was allowed to participate in any phase of the contest except officiating. The attempt to implement the non-adult rule in Detroit demonstrates the  efforts of Blanchard and other reformers to return the control of athletic events to the students. Yet, the idealistic program failed in Detroit after a four-year trial. The general public, players, and especially the coaches were not prepared for such an innovative concept. In this instance, the press played a major role in establishing educational policy. Also detrimental was Blanchard's inability to communicate the rationale for the program to the athletic consumers. Had that plan worked, students would have entered the mainstream of decision-making by controlling their own affairs. This would have indicated that the program of inter-school athletics was not a social agent transmitting the culture surrounding it. Yet the program was rejected, indicating that interscholastic athletics  was an agency for the integration of the whole of the culture. (Author)",

        "description":"Although it has been said that the women in Ancient Egypt enjoyed a reasonable state of social and professional equality with men, this paper presents an alternate theory--that women were second-class citizens whose physical prowess was secondary to their role as sex objects. It appears that men and women in Ancient Egypt often participated in the same activities. Women, however, seem always to have been a few steps behind. Pharaohs kept hundreds of young girls, yet there is no record of queens keeping young men. Records indicate that when families went fishing, the man pulled in the fish, while the woman supported his efforts. It is suggested that men had control over tomb-painting and writing, the two most valuable stores of information on the nature of women's role in the  society. This may account for the high proportion of illustrations showing women in sex-object roles. (MM)",

        "description":"On August 26, 1831, educators attending a meeting of the American Institute of Instruction confirmed the need for physical exercise in schools, but wanted to determine what type of exercise program would be invigorating, utilitarian, interesting, and provide moral development. Advocates of manual labor programs stressed that physical labor provided serviceable and healthy exercise and aided in forming habits of industry. Few school labor programs in New England remained in existence for more than two seasons because they were financially unprofitable and drudgery for students. During the early 19th century children's recess activities included games and sports. Though rough-and-tumble activities near buildings were prohibited, school windows were broken and passing townspeople  disrupted. Educators were seeking methods of controlling recess games, plus increasing moral development experiences. If games and sports could provide moral development opportunities, they would be considered of educational merit. The educational merits of sports have been debated throughout American history. This early athletic debate focused interest on games and sports as possible physical education activities. (Author/JD)",

        "description":"The main consideration involves several subproblems. (1) The fundamental terms (work, play, freedom, constraint, amateur, professional, sport, athletics) are generally used in a sharply dichotomized way. However, they can, and perhaps should, be understood as part of a definitional continuum. (2) The status of sport and athleitcs in education is faced with the problem of so-called amateur, semiprofessional, and professional sport--defined in terms of money rather than, as it should be, as a logical progression of proficiency. (3) This problem of status is related to society as a whole. The concept of work is exalted and play is viewed as frivolous refreshment from worthwhile toil. Thus it is not difficult to understand how the dichotomy of work - play has arisen. (4) Our language  downgrades that which we seek in the \"good life\" --work is viewed as superior to play, whereas actually they are equal and overlapping. Modifying our concepts of work, play, amateur, and professional would probably have a positive influence on the pattern of North American sport and athletics. A final conclusion is justifiable: the concepts of work and play should be modified so that a continuum is recognized between them and the concept of \"art\" is established as a middle ground. So also with the terms, amateur, professional, and semiprofessional. Identifying the language ailment will help with treatment and cure.

More specifically, it can be seen that ancient religious customs and festivals in honor of fertility goddesses were transformed into sports activities in which women figured prominently. Throughout the Mediterranean basin, cults of the Earth Mother (Magna Mater, Gaia, Isis, Demeter) were closely associated with fertility and agriculture. Festivals held in honor of these goddesses involved singing, acrobatic dancing, and racing. Women, as devotees of these deities, were the major participants in bare-foot fertility races, ball games, and cult rituals, which later developed into nonreligious folk games. It would thus seem that women's contributions to  the development of sports and games were more important than previously acknowledged by scholars. (MB)",

Caucasian lacrosse enthusiasts sought to promote \"their\" game by arranging for Indian demonstrations to be staged prior to, or during, important lacrosse tournaments; as a part of fund raising ventures; and in the presence of various dignitaries and members of royalty. The colorfulness of the native and the uniqueness of his game were deliberately used to promote the Dominion abroad and to foster nationalism at home. The native athlete, in return for services rendered, received remuneration in one form or another. While the amounts may not have been  substantial, they found a welcome place in the native coffer. While there were obviously some short term pay-offs for the Indian, in the long haul it was the European who stood to gain the most from native involvement in lacrosse. The white man reaped, for as long as possible, whatever dividends he was able, by exploiting the skills of the Indian on the playing field and his salability at the box-office. (Author/JD)",

        "description":"The contention that the future of sport and physical education can be shaped by its history is the foundation of this discussion. The paper begins with a brief mention of six social forces at work and ten concomitant professional concerns. It then presents Heilbroner's concept of the future as history; discusses the idea of progress; suggests some implications for sport and physical education based on Heilbroner's concept; discusses the concept of progress in relation to the United States and the American dream; and, finally, draws several conclusions. The social forces and professional concerns enumerated are viewed by the author as 16 persistent historical problems facing the field of sport and physical education. How society copes with these problems will determine whether  sport and physical education will serve this culture in a socially useful capacity or whether they will develop into symptoms and causes of the society's eventual downfall. Heilbroner's concept of the future as history alerts us to the possibility that Americans have a seemingly blind philosophy of history that has flaws and malfunctions that were not foreseen. Considering the future as history, individuals and the society as a whole can work to realize a &quot;North American Dream&quot; in a world setting--sport and physical activity under highly professional leadership can be a powerful social force in realizing that dream.

Each Generic Objective indicates the stimulus, how the information is received by the student, the general operation and the component operated on, and the output expected from the student.

Informal use in classrooms from kindergarten to high school levels indicated its potential value as a counseling tool. Evidence of convergent and discriminant validity of a pencil and paper version of SPERT was found in a study of 200 college students. Contrary to expectations, a U-shaped relationship  was found between SPERT discrepancy and emotional adjustment. Highly self-accepting individuals with large self-ideal self discrepancies scored higher on measures of adjustment and social desirability, lower on a measure of anxiety than did less highly self-accepting individuals with large discrepancies.

For the assessment of performance skills, new types of exercises and administration procedures were designed, and scoring criteria for the variety of performance tasks were developed. Standard instructions were given at all levels, and responses were recorded so they could be evaluated and scored later by trained music educators. The scorers counted errors in completeness, pitch, and rhythm, and the summary of these was  the score for overall quality. In each category, the error rate determined whether a performance was &quot;markedly deficient&quot; or not.

The Rasch item characteristic curve is a new concept in test design and analysis. The Rasch test model provides information concerning the percent of students with a specified achievement level who would be expected to correctly answer a question with a specified difficulty. Using this information, it is possible to make a continuous plot of the expected percent correct across the full range of achievement. This plot constitutes the Rasch item characteristic curve. From the data gathered in this study it appears that using a minimum score group size of three to five students, a refined fit cutoff of .05 to .10 are optimum.

The general systems model is an extension of all these, adding the dimension of environmental influence on the system as well as system influence on the environment. However, if the theory model is changed, traditional statistical procedures may no longer be applicable and other mehtods should be used. The Set, Information, Graph, and General System Model (SIGGS) is a further extension of general systems in that set theory, information theory, and digraph theory are used as models to extend general systems theory.

These recommendations include more precise definitions of variables and samples, the inclusion of marker variables, and a review of the literature to plan alignment of new studies with old. Each of these recommendations is worthy of consideration and balanced implementation. Balanced implementation is the key, however. Excessive zeal in forcing any of these recommendations into regulations would seriously hinder the freedom of the researcher to explore and in the final analysis, be counter productive. (Author/RC)",

        "description":"Multiple regression studies of schools are capable of detecting only &quot;average&quot; effect. A basic assumption of such studies is that all schools are functioning within the parameters of a given educational technology and that differences in output can be attributed to different levels of input. With decentralized decision making characteristics of public elementary and secondary education, it is entirely possible that some schools are functioning within totally different parameters than are the bulk of schools. If these &quot;different&quot; schools are small in number, their effect would be lost in a multiple regression analysis. Using data of the public elementary schools in New York State, regression analysis was used to identify outlier schools, socioeconomic characteristics being the  independent variables and average pupil achievement being the dependent variable. Schools with an unusually large residual score were considered outliers, and were compared with other schools using analysis of variance. Both positive and negative outliers tended to be small innovative schools, but the positive achievers were different with respect to resource applications in a direction which supports conventional wisdom about quality schools. The paper concludes by discussing the implications for future research. (BW)",

        "description":"Response to change in educational institutions requires information about influential factors. The conceptual framework which guided this study views the process of change in three basic phases. First, there is an antecedent phase which necessitates the coming together of an advocate with an innovation designed for some set of consumers. Once these conditions are in existence, the process of change enters an interactive phase in which advocates and consumers communicate about the content of the innovation. The third phase, the consequent or impact phase, really overlaps the interactive phase and consists of the effects or consequences of the interactive phase. This paper reports the development and results of a survey technique to gain information on the response to an innovation  in six high schools. Data was gathered three times over a year's time. The analysis revealed that involvement in, attitudes toward, and expectations for the innovation varied over time and among sites. Respondents of black ethnic origin were also shown to be more involved and more positive than their white colleagues. This information was useful to developers and users in their attempt to respond to the change. (Author/BW)",

The analysis that followed led to the conclusion that empirical procedures were highly desirable. When these empirical procedures were applied to test data, the results indicated that four different techniques provided almost identical information: Rasch statistics, instructional sensitivity indexes, traditional statistics, and Baysian indexes. Based on these results, it would seem that any one of these four would serve adequately. (Author/RC)",

Comparisons of misclassifications are examined for varying sample sizes for two and three dimensional models. Three types of distributions are considered: finite range (Logit Normal), semi-infinite range (Log Normal), and infinite range (Inverse Hyperbolic Sine Normal). Results indicate that certain alternatives to the LDF classify observations correctly in a greater proportion than does the LDF for non-normal data, and that  different procedures are best for different types of non-normality.

The questionnaire was developed to solicit information in the following five areas: (1) local use of criterion-objective referenced tests; (2) research and evaluation activities related to locally-developed criterion-objective referenced tests; (3) the tendancy to compare locally-developed criterion-objective referenced tests with other school systems; (4) the tendency to request other school systems to share their respective developments in the area of criterion-objective referenced tests; and (5) the inclination of teachers to use criterion-objective referenced tests in their  instructional activities. The major finding was the indication of considerable interest and usage of criterion-objective referenced testing in the member systems. An examination of the individual items revealed that there is generally limited understanding on the part of classroom teachers, and that little attention is given to the technical characteristics of these tests, such as reliability, validity, and item analyses.

Of the total number of scores submitted, about 60 percent are passing; (5) institutions that have conducted research on the use of the General Examinations have found that the grades of students who receive credit tend to be equal to or better than the grades of other students; and (6) a small percentage of the institutions reported encountering difficulties in dealing with both CLEP scores and the College Board's Advanced Placement Examination for awarding credit.

In test construction, where criterion-related validity data are usually not collected until after the test is completed, assessment of bias in the absence of outside criteria had become a vital issue. Here, an unbiased test item is defined as one in which, for persons with the same ability in the areas being measured, the probability of a correct response on the item is the same regardless of the population group membership of the individual. The total score on a test or subtest containing the item can be used to define groups of persons having the same ability. Once the ability groups have been defined, a modified chi square procedure is used to  evaluate each item in the test for possible bias. While hypotheses suggested by such an evaluation should be investigated further before making conclusive statements concerning the source of bias, results reported in this study support the validity of the method as a procedure for assessing bias when outside criterion measures are unavailable.

Hypothesizing that expectations function as prior cognitive states, activating and determining student classroom interactions including evaluations, this study design differentiated three sets of expectations, identifying the contextual ones as associated with classroom outcomes. The instrument derived its twenty survey items from previous works which then were scaled using Semantic Differential adjectives, and administered to 209 subjects in eight social science classes in three colleges at the beginning and close of a  semester.

After an evaluation of this change, some general trends were discovered, such as the dependence of course effectiveness on the quality of the course leadership; the need for more logistic and consultantive support; the need for the development of syllabi to coordinate lectures given by a group of faculty members; and the possibility for experimentation with new techniques for education and evaluation. Many of these new techniques have also been adopted in the disciplinary courses. Student comments and item analysis of all examinations are currently being used to gain insight into the effectiveness of the program. (BW)",

The exam focuses on basic reading and computing skills. In this study, a variety of findings are reported. School districts have a budgetary disincentive to be receptive to the CHSPE, because every student who exits early results in revenue losses to the district. A long-range budgetary effect of the CHSPE is to shorten the period of total schooling time and result in potential net savings to the state. Choices outside the high school may be limited for CHSPE certificate-holders. Those who pass the exam and stay in school can take more pleasurable courses, yet not worry about making up  or taking more required courses. The survey that is included here was used to obtain a profile of the students who do take the exam. (Author/BW)",

In the author's opinion, school-wide aptitude testing is not a particularly useful practice when other types of information, particularly grades, achievement tests, and teacher's comments, are available, though it may be useful when there is no information about the student or when special aptitudes for special programs, are being sought. Whereas aptitude tests claim to be able to measure an individual's future performance, achievement tests are closely tied to things which people have done, to scientifically verifiable accomplishments. Norm-referenced tests classify children on the basis of their relative accomplishments, but  have limited value for identifying educational deficiencies as a means of providing effective remediation. Criterion referenced tests strive to overcome that problem. In the final section, the New Jersey State Assessment Program is discussed; the appendixes include a glossary of terms and a guide to test scores. (Author/BW)",

Also studied was the accuracy of student perceptions of the difficulty of adaptive and conventional tests administered with or without immediate knowledge of results. Testees were 350 college students divided into high- and low-ability groups and randomly assigned to one of four test strategies by KR conditions. The ability level of examinees was found to be related to their reported levels of motivation and to differences in reported motivation under the different testing conditions. These results suggest that adaptive testing creates a psychological environment for testing which is more equivalently motivating for examinees of all  ability levels and results in a greater standardization of the test-taking environment, than does conventional testing.

The effects of KR were examined on a 50-item conventional test and a stradaptive ability test and in high- and low-ability groups. The primary dependent variable was maximum likelihood ability estimates derived from the item responses. Results indicated that mean test scores for the High-Ability group receiving KR were higher than for the No-KR group on both the conventional and stradaptive tests. For Low-Ability examinees, mean scores were higher under KR conditions than under NO-KR conditions on both tests, but the difference was statistically significant only for the conventional test. However,  the higher mean scores of the Low-Ability testees on the stradaptive test indicated that for low-ability examinees, adaptive testing had the same effects on test performance as did the provision of immediate KR.

Subsequently, the results were compared across varying levels of program personnel, including administrators, faculty, staff and students. Centered in a relatively self-contained academic program of a large midwestern university, this study used a free response method of data collection--a relatively unknown technique. Consistent differences were found among various levels of personnel as to their perception of the ideal faculty member. In addition, the procedure provided a means of comparing the perceived performance of individual faculty members. In general, the data seemed to indicate that subgroups of personnel were operating from what appeared to be a  consistent frame of reference, but that they rationalized the characteristics somewhat differently. Moreover, the perceptions were not consistent among groups. These discrepancies might result in role expectations which might go unfulfilled or overfulfilled, causing probable miscommunication and lack of efficiency, affecting the morale of involved personnel. Internal conflict could also be a possibility. (MV)",

In 1972, an approach that has been common for many years at the university level was tried. Basically it entailed preparing class cards by using the computer, based on a preliminary survey of student interests, and then the students literally selected the exact courses, teachers, and time they wanted. Thus far, the procedure has been evaluated with student and teacher questionnaires. This preliminary evaluation report recommends that school staffs should be given considerable leeway in determining which registration approach should be used  at their school, and should be active in advising students and parents about registration procedures. Further study of the number of schedule changes is still necessary. As a general concluding statement, school staffs and students regarded the new registration procedure as reasonably successful in comparison with past years. (BW)",

South Mountain High School was selected as the pilot school for the implementation of the program. The purpose of this report is to summarize the effectiveness of the Year Round School Program in attaining specified objectives and to make recommendations for the future status of the Year Round School program at South Mountain High School.

        "description":"Physical Education Opportunities for Exceptional Learners (PEOPEL) is a second year Elementary Secondary Education Act (ESEA) Title III project within the Phoenix Union High School System. This program is designed to meet the need for a program at the secondary school level that addresses itself to meeting physical, social, emotional and mental needs of physically and mentally handicapped and other exceptional students. In 1975-76 the PEOPEL staff pilot-tested and revised curriculum materials and teaching strategies which were developed in 1974-75. A comparison of 54 PEOPEL students with 36 other handicapped students not participating in PEOPEL provided evidence that the PEOPEL program had a positive effect on students' physical abilities and attitudes. Based on findings of the  evaluation, recommendations were made to adopt the PEOPEL program as a regular program in the Phoenix Union High School System and to periodically re-evaluate the impact that the PEOPEL program has on students' physical and mental education.

The conceptual framework includes the concept of an educational program as a system of curricular and instructional claims and methods of evaluation which entail a wide range of judgments of both logical validity and factual validity. Judgments of logical validity are made in reference to the internal structure of each of the claims and its various components, the relationships among the claims constituting a program, and the relationships between the component claims of a program and the bases of the profession under which the program is formulated and operates. The logic of reaching judgments of factual validity of the individual curricular and instructional claims, and of the  program as a whole, has been described. Judgments of factual validity of the various component claims, and of the program, are made on the basis of observations of pupil performance and teacher action to determine whether those behaviors correspond to that which is entailed by fulfillment of the goal, rule, and qualifier components of the claims.

These analyses were conducted in the validation of a test design to measure for the most part a factor of literal comprehension independent of IQ and inferential reading processes, yet marked by certain related types of test items included in standardized and other measures of literal comprehension. In this study, the Multiple-Choice Cloze (MCC) test was administered to a sample of 3,125 students in grades one to six in a medium-sized urban school district in conjunction with its annual standardized testing program. Besides the MCC, other measures included in the analyses were an alternate measure of literal comprehension based on Bormuth's  wh-item, a measure of passage independence based on wh-items, the Short Form Test of Academic Aptitude, and the California Achievement Test. The factor analytic results support the conclusion that the MCC measures literal comprehension, a trait that is essentially independent of IQ. However, it was also determined that the MCC had minor loadings on a second, and possibly a third, component related to IQ, inferential reading skills, and language mechanics. (Author)",

The first is an ethnographic analysis of the language interaction patterns of the target children and their bilingual teacher. The amount of time each language (Spanish and  English) is spoken and a functional analysis of language use is discussed. The second analysis is an ecological comparison of the bilingual and regular classrooms as behavior settings.

But most specialists in this area now concede that there is almost more exception than rule in this generalization, and that individual test items may actually modify observed patterns of sex differences. Sex role stereotyping and the issue of male/female representation in test content have often been glossed over with respect to mathematics tests, and, to a lesser extent, with respect to science tests. The effects of item type and item context on sex-differentiated performance are better documented. The balancing of these two aspects of test content is important to remember in the construction of tests. It is also important to have a close match between the test  item content and the curriculum or aptitude areas they are intended to measure. There are several sets of useful guidelines available for eliminating sexist content in these materials, but developers should be aware that such efforts cannot be expected to influence test performance for either sex. The issue of performance-related test content must remain a completely separate one, to be resolved in psychometric rather than value-oriented terms. (Author/BW)",

The pilot program, first of a planned television series intended to facilitate the desegregation process in our nation's high schools, was produced by television station WTTW in Chicago in cooperation with student co-producer teams. The students provided personalized statements on desegregation as it occurred in their schools and communities. The finished pilot program, based on three student scripts was shown to 1,241 high school students. They were black and white, Asian-American, Hispanic-American and Native American, and lived in cities, suburbs, small towns and rural areas in every region of the nation. Students who saw the pilot film knew more about, and  expressed more favorable attitudes toward, desegregation than classmates who had not yet seen the film. Section 1 includes the findings of a literature search to provide background for the project. The design of the evaluation is described in Section 2 and includes detailed information on subjects, instrumentation used, and data collection, processing, and analysis. Findings are reported in Section 3. Results of questionnaire administrations are summarized for subjects who viewed the pilot film. The section also includes content analysis of the three pilot segment scripts, Q-sort, and distractor analysis findings. Implications of findings for future programming are also discussed.

        "description":"A model for educational supervisors which attempts to link management theory to learning is demonstrated. With teachers today having greater autonomy in selecting appropriate content and methods, supervisors should focus on two tasks: they should become more involved with teachers in selecting goals and become more adept in monitoring the development of pupils. Selected characteristics of pupils and classrooms, indicators of classroom environment, and measures of achievement and attitudes of over 1,100 students in grades nine and ten mathematics classes were collected. Results indicated some areas for supervisory action. Overall achievement of students was strongly related to student characteristics, indicating that schools do little to equalize the various advantages of children  or to assist individuals to achieve a high level of competence. Second, classroom environments, as measured by Walberg's Learning Environment Inventory, were also directly related to achievement. If climate, influenced both by teachers and pupils, is related to achievement, teaching method, as identified in this study, is not. Attitudes of students toward mathematics was not related to any other variable selected for the study. There was evidence to suggest that such attitudinal goals were largely ignored by teachers of mathematics. (RC)",

        "description":"Differences between two models of student-instructor disparity regarding educational views and preferences in accounting for variance in course rating scores were investigated. Undergraduates in nine classes completed the Student Instructional Report (SIR) and the Student Orientations Survey; instructors completed a parallel inventory, the Faculty Orientations Survey. On each orientation scale, a student's score was compared with his instructor's score and two disparity scores were calculated: 1) an absolute disparity score (which assessed only the magnitude of disparity, and 2) a relative disparity score (which assessed both magnitude and direction of disparity). After accounting for class differences and student orientation scores in their own right, multiple regression  analyses involving course rating scores yielded significant increases in explained variance for three SIR course rating scales when student-instructor relative disparity measures were included. The inclusion of absolute disparity measures in lieu of relative disparity yielded insignificant changes in explained variance. Moreover, on these three SIR scales, relative disparity measures generated larger increases in explained variance compared to the inclusion of student orientation scores per se. (Author/MV)",

An evaluation was conducted of the elementary school level (Career Awareness) and at the junior high school level (Career Exploratory) during 1974-75. The results of that evaluation, while positive at the elementary level, were inconclusive at the junior high school level. The 1975-76 evaluation was directed primarily at the junior high school program, although the elementary school students who were tested during 1974-75 were again reevaluated to determine whether their gains in career awareness, measured last year, were being maintained. The junior high school students who had participated in the 1974-75 evaluation were similarly reexamined to determine what might be the nature of their trends in  career attitudes and knowledge. Unlike the elementary school pupils, they did not attain the national norms in either career attitudes or knowledge in 1974-75. As of February, 1976 they still had not, but they were nearly attaining the norm in career knowledge and they were making moderate advances on the norm in attitudes towards work. The junior high school Career Exploratory pupils showed other moderate gains in 1975-76, as well. Compared to other schools in the county, the state assessment of eighth grade achievement indicated that the Career Exploratory schools were superior to the Dade County averages in reading, occupational information, and mathematics.

Eight tests administered to 200 graduate students studying educational research are analyzed. The analysis considers the original tests, the items loading on the first factor of the test, and the items which fit the Rasch model. Adjustments for test length are considered. Tests shortened by deleting items which do not fit the Rasch model have a higher internal consistency reliability then the longer original tests. This finding contradicts the theorem of classical test theory which states that increasing test length increases test reliability. The explanation for the find is that the theorem of classical test theory assumes that all items  are homogeneous. Items not fitting the Rasch model are not unidimensional in the &quot;latent-trait&quot; sense which corresponds to being non-homogeneous in the &quot;classical-test-theory&quot; sense. Deleting such items results in a proportionately longer test in that a larger proportion of the remaining items is homogeneous. The misfitting items would not have been deleted on the basis of a classical item analysis. (Author/BW)",

Several of the most common problems in the related literature are outlined and include how ratings are related to grades awarded; the relationship between course content, or major areas, and student ratings; agreement between student raters and other raters; the relationship of student learning and teacher rating; the halo effect on teacher rating; the influence of course or class level and class size on instructor ratings; reliability of teacher rating; and the politics of evaluation. If sense is to be made of student rating  instruments, the author suggests a threefold approach. First, he proposes a moratorium on student ratings as evaluative measures. Second, existing instruments need to be refined until they satisfy minimal criteria of objectivity, reliability, sensitivity, validity, and utility. Finally, he proposes that student ratings be studied in depth. Their use, for the time being, must be experimental and not evaluative. Suggested research directions are proposed. (RC)",

Student rating of teaching and course related items and student self ratings were gleaned from a twenty item questionnaire. One hundred fifty-nine students in two courses responded to the questionnaire at the end of the spring 1975 semester. Students rated themselves, the four instructors in each course, and the course itself. Regression analyses indicated a very strong halo effect of instructor ratings over course ratings; student self ratings appeared not to bear any relationship to course ratings; and it was found that many of  the variables that are often implicitly and explicitly criticized by students as having an effect on their educational experience (e.g. the quality of exam questions, course level, utility of textbooks, reasonableness of assignments) did not predict their rating of that experience very well. On the other hand, nearly every item that was concerned with teacher behavior accounted for a significant amount of variation in the instructors' overall evaluation. (Author)",

The question pursued was whether there would be any realtionship between an instrument's quality and the frequenc with which it was used. For measures of quality the numerical ratings published by the UCLA Center for the Study of Test Evaluation were used. As a measure of usage the number of times an instrument was mentioned in 3,538 research proposal was conducted. There did appear to be a positive relationship between the qualit of tests and their frequency of use. A preference for the better rated instruments was particularly evident with tests of academic achievement. More equivocal results  appeared in tests of vocational skills and intelliegnce, thoug in certain respects researchers were definitely using the better of those available in these two categories. The anomaly was in the categories of reading tests and tests of personality where the higher rated of the tests had no better chance of being utilized than those judged to be of poor quality. Particular areas such as in reading and personality where the higher rated tests were less likely to be used might point to the need for special attention when choosing instruments for future research (Author/RC)",

Four different formats were constructed and randomly distributed to 363 college students within 27 university classes. The results of a principal components analysis suggest that the factor structure underlying the rating instrument is stable and not affected by changes in the placement of items. The nonsignificant results from a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) provide  additional support for the stability of the ratings. The MANOVA results in particular suggest that student ratings do not increase or decrease as a result of changes in item placement. The results of both analyses detract from the view that the halo effect may be influenced by the positioning of items. There is thus little reason to believe that preliminary items may set the stage for responses on following items. (RC)",

The envisioned programs differ only in informative detail. Most such differences are viewed as amenable to formalization and the basis for distinguishing between local instructional management requirements and state and national stocktaking requirements for information on scholastic achievements is illustrated for selected knowledges and skills. The implications of the envisioned achievement testing programs for local, state, and national determinations of educational productivity are noted. It is contended that the earliest apt educational productivity estimates must be based on aggregate direct costs  of education as inputs--perhaps with a &quot;catch-up&quot; cost portion removed by general agreement--and short-term absolute scholastic achievement effects as outputs.

        "description":"Adults appear to have different perceptions of a child when rating a child on the Barber Scales of Self-Regard based on correlation coefficients between different sets of adults (parents and teachers). It is the purpose of this study to explore at greater depth the differences between mother and father as to the way they perceive their child. Do they agree or disagree--and to what extent--when they each rate their preschooler on the Scales of Self-Regard? Results of this study show that when parents rate their child on the Barber Scales of Self-Regard, disagreements can be expected. Disagreements vary from Scale to Scale. Mother or father does not consistently rate higher on any of the Scales, with the exception of the Scale &quot;Children's Responses to Requests&quot; where mothers appear  to be the higher rater. There is some clue that slight differences between parent raters occur more frequently with female children than with male children. Although differences can be expected, the results of this study indicate that differences are for the most part by only one-scale point. Perhaps both parents are correct and the child is, in reality, somewhere in between the levels described by the scale points. (Author/MV)",

After an extensive period of development by the Bureau of School Programs Evaluation of the New York State Education Department, reports were prepared for 628 school districts in New York State. They were distributed at regional meetings to school superintendents or their representatives, or by mail to those districts not represented at a meeting. The importance of shaping the program to meet the needs of local educators was recognized since the use of any information system depends upon the intended users' perceptions of the validity, utility, and applicability of the program. After consulatation with the Bureau of Statistical  Services, a telephone survey of a random sample of chief school administrators seemed to be a feasible method of obtaining the desired information. Staff members of the two bureaus clarified objectives, developed the methodology, and carried out the survey. The survey had two purposes: 1) to collect information on the Performance Indicators program; and 2) to develop the telephone survey as a technique for rapid data collection and analysis.

Part of this investigation involved three separate ratings of the pilot test classrooms with the assessment scale. These ratings were given at the beginning, middle, and end of the school year. Classrooms with maximum training scored on the average approximately 10 per cent higher on each of the essentials than did the classes with materials only. With comparison classes, however, that  consistency was lacking. On the essentials of physical setting, unit use, and parent involvement the comparison classrooms actually scored higher than the DARCEE group with the maximum training, on two other essentials (reinforcement and behavior management and attitude development) and on student involvement they scored higher than DARCEE classrooms with the minimum training, whereas on the essentials of skill development, organization and use of time, grouping, teacher roles and responsibilities, and teacher preparation these classes scored lower than both DARCEE classroom treatments.

The resulting 12 tests were administered to 199 eighth-grade students. The hypothesis of equivalent measures was rejected for only two comparisons: the constructed response measure of verbal comprehension was different from both the standard and the Coombs multiple-choice measures of this ability. Maximum likelihood factors analysis confirmed the hypothesis that a five factor structure will give a satisfactory  account of the common variance among the 12 tests. As expected, the two major factors were mathematical reasoning and verbal comprehension. Contrary to expectation, only one of the other three factors bore a (weak) resemblance to a format factor. Tests marking the ability to follow directions, recall and recognition memory, and risk taking were included, but these variables did not correlate as expected with the three minor factors.

Essentially, the same pattern and magnitude of change was revealed for college subgroups classified on the basis of size, geographic area, curricular emphasis, degrees offered, and public-private. Possible actions to counter the trend were cited but rational initial steps proposed more research to identify the scope of the problem and reasons for the movement. Dialogue to develop an institutional or unit perspective was considered an essential phase. Grade inflation was considered to be but symptom of a  broader problem; namely, of an increased concern for student views and subsequent instructional innovations to adapt to these views. (Author)",

The primary project goals were to attract capable persons to education careers, improve employment opportunities of the poor, and establish productive career lattices for COP recruits. Overall, COP attained its major goals while benefiting all participants--trainees, teachers, pupils, principals, and college staff. COP was partially successful in attracting minority, low-income, target area residents to careers in education. The majority of trainees were black community residents, and a  third were Model Cities aides with low incomes. The project also successfully implemented a vertical career ladder, which facilitated trainee movement at higher level instructional jobs. However, horizontal and diagonal lattices were not implemented. Additional findings are discussed in detail. (Author/RC)",

        "description":"The feasibility of using criterion referenced tests (CRTs) in a large-scale evaluation conducted in an effectiveness evaluation context was investigated. The study began by examining the theory that structures the development and validation of CRTs to discover whether, on theoretical grounds alone, CRTs are suitable or not suitable for large-scale effectiveness evaluations. Next, a set of criteria were developed for selecting tests appropriate for such evaluations. Included within the set of criteria was the stipulation that the test be able to provide scores amenable to CRT interpretation. Twenty-eight currently available CRTs were then reviewed, using the set of criteria. Finally, based on theoretical examination and the review, conclusions were drawn. Based on practical, not  theoretical, considerations, it was concluded that there is no currently available CRT that is feasible for use in large-scale effectiveness evaluations. (RC)",

It presents the major results of the study with attention to methodological considerations of analysis. Two sets of analyses are discussed: (1) a set designed to examine the effectiveness of the UB program nationally, and (2) a set designed to examine differential UB project effectiveness. The national impact findings are quite consistent in support of the central theme that for student outcomes relating to postsecondary school entry, there are strong positive relationships with UB participation; but for outcomes related to high school academic success or continuation no consistent relationships to UB participation exist.  These findings suggest that the impact of the UB program on student participants is primarily in the area of facilitating entry into education beyond high school. Given a national program impact, findings related to differential project effectiveness do not reveal any systematic program treatments that are related to differential project success. Rather, the relative success of individual projects seems more related to the characteristics of students recruited than to functional or structural characteristics of the projects. (Author)",

        "description":"The potential uses of ethnography and aesthetic criticism as sources for developing a qualitative approach to evaluating classrooms are delineated. Such work involves three interrelated processes--description, interpretation, and appraisal--which are discussed and exemplified. When describing a classroom, the evaluator vividly renders it, recreating it for others, and points out its pervasive quality. Interpretation consists of discussing the social meaning of classroom events, analyzing a classroom into its constituent parts and resynthesizing them to form a whole, and relating classroom events to external considerations. Appraisal entails weighing whether (and on what grounds) a particular lesson or practice is worthwhile and whether the lesson or practice was executed well.  These three processes necessitate the researcher's drawing upon many ideas from education, sociology, philosophy, psychology, and so forth. Additionally, consideration is given to qualifications of an educational evaluator using qualitative methods--a broad understanding of classrooms, an ability to observe classrooms sensitivity, and the ability to transmit the experience to others.

The paper focuses on teacher judgments and observations about the interactive behavior of other teachers. The teacher-judges viewed videotaped sequences of several lessons similar in content to lessons they themselves had just finished teaching. Patterns of teacher observation and preferences are reported and comparisons made to pupil observations based on viewing the same videotaped lesson segments. The study indicates that there are statistically significant differences in the kinds of comments made by teachers of high and low pupil gain scores, that teachers as a whole seem to attend to relevant aspects of a given lesson and respond differently when observing different teaching  procedures, that individual teachers respond differentially to the same lesson, and that pupils are attentive to different aspects of lessons than their teachers.

The best half of the items in each test were selected for each group. Typically about 30 percent of the items in the upper half of the distribution of item-test correlations for a group on a test did not meet this criterion with another group. By this criterion minority groups were relatively similar as were the three suburban groups. The resulting unique item tests did not  correlate well with each other. Scores of minority groups were relatively better on the selected items. Thus, standard item selection procedures produce tests best suited to groups like the majority of the tryout sample and are therefore biased against other groups to some degree. This degree varies. Ways to minimize this bias need to be developed. (Author/MS)",

It provides a logical, step by step approach to the identification of possible failure factors and the interactive effects of those factors which could result in a predetermined undesired event.

The document has gathered together a variety of materials collected rather incidentally, and the information presented in each section focuses on a number of topics briefly. The topics addressed are the following: university entrance, high school entrance in Kobe, the family background of different high school student populations, some considerations on family, neighborhood and achievement before high school, high school sub-cultures, and the movement for high school reform. It is suggested that a critical social issue for modern Japan lies in the growing importance of family  background. Postwar education, although more inclusive and democratic, has also become a field of competition in which the trend is toward a greater influence for family background factors. As education becomes more central to more of the populace, it also becomes more and more susceptible to the influence of intensified differences in each family capacity to compete in this arena.

Furthermore, his model is shown to be not immutable. In particular, Jensen's assumption that one twin's environment is as highly correlated with the other twin's genotype as with his own genotype is questioned. It is stated that the twin method cannot be used to extract meaningful estimates of the variances, and covariance, of the genetic and environmental components of human intelligence. Finally, it is said that any plausible  model for the resemblance between the twins will have so many more unknown parameters than observations that the task is futile. (Author/AM)",

Focus centers on the public kindergarten since, in the absence of racially mixed neighborhoods, it constitutes the first formal interracial experience for most children. Two hundred and forty six-year-old children were divided into eight groups on the basis of race, sex, and public kindergarten experience. Subjects individually participated in a two-part selection procedure designed to investigate racial preferences. Children consistently registered strongest preference for same race individuals and totally same race classroom settings. The study suggests that the racially mixed kindergarten  neighborhood seems to be unable to perform effectively the social interaction and attitude development functions one would associate with the racially integrated residence neighborhood. Until the latter becomes social reality, the most concerted efforts in racial mixing may have primarily cosmetic rather than depth effects on children's attitudes. (Author/AM)",

Malnutrition, one of the byproducts of low economic status, is creating a crisis-proportion health problem affecting minority citizens. Malnutrition seriously affects children, older people in poverty, and chronically unemployed or underemployed youth. It is also most likely to be found among the drug and alcohol addicted population. Frequently, malnutrition leads to tuberculosis and other diseases among older people and results in infant mortality and diseases of the newborn. Poverty has been identified as the cause of malnutrition, and a corresponding proportion of difficulties children experience in school and later in their career development may be due to deficit  nutrition affecting brain growth during early life. Because Detroit's over fifty percent black population is the worst affected economically in the entire nation, the city is most likely to be affected by malnutrition on a scale greater than the national average. The Detroit Urban League intends to direct research effort in evaluating the nutritional problems of minorities in order to find productive outlets for channeling their resources. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"The attitudes of Canadians toward multiculturalism were investigated in this study. Four attitude domains were examined. The first dealt with the attitudes held by Canadians toward a variety of ethnic groups in the country. The second involved general beliefs regarding cultural diversity. The third consisted of attitudes toward immigration. The fourth domain included the psychological phenomenon of prejudice and discrimination. Two questions constituted the core of the present study: whether Canadians view cultural diversity as a valuable resource, and whether confidence in one's own identity is a preprequisite for accepting others. The results for each of the four attitude domains in the total sample are presented first, and the major trends that emerge across the four domains  are described. Respondents in the study showed a reasonably high level of overtolerance for ethnic diversity and a general acceptance for multiculturalism as a social fact. The study also revealed a considerable lack of knowledge concerning multiculturalism as government policy. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"Some of the schooling experiences of a rapidly expanding migrant population from the Dominican Republic are described in this paper. In doing this, the paper examines the societal and organizational context of the educational system in the Dominican Republic, and briefly outlines the organization of and practices in Dominican classrooms, the nature of teacher-student interaction styles, and the relationship between school and home life. Information about school organization and classrooms is obtained through interviews with professors, school directors, teachers, parents, and students. In addition to general interviewing, two public schools were selected for more systematic observations. To check whether the data collected in the two schools were representative of schools in the  Dominican Republic, observations were then made in additional public and private schools. It was found that whatever difficulties educators and students in the Dominican Republic encounter in the educational process, education itself is accorded the highest priority throughout the country. Despite many obstacles, the majority of those classroom teachers and school directors conduct classroom programs that allow students to meet the country's educational standards. Dominican children coming to the U.S. bring with them certain expectations based on their experiences in their native educational system. They find themselves attending schools embedded in a different social context, which fact for many of them, leads to confusion and conflict. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"A discussion of the concept of equality as it relates to educational opportunities in New Jersey and as it has been interpreted both historically and in the present day setting, is the focus of this paper. The notion of equality and equal opportunity has been a part of American history from the beginning. Although throughout history many people have believed that equal educational opportunity existed and those who were not successful had only themselves to blame, this myth has been at least to some extent discredited by the Court's argument in the Brown vs Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas. Today, the meaning of the concept equal educational opportunity for the schools and for society is a subject of considerable debate and controversy. Some argue that equal per pupil  expenditure or tax base equalization will bring about reform, while others suggest this is not enough and subscribe to a definition of equal educational opportunity as equality in terms of educational resources. Others espouse the belief that equal educational opportunity means that the average and the range of distribution in school achievement should ultimately be the same for all social groups. The meaning of equal opportunity in education regarding the nature of the opportunities themselves is an area of concern for New Jersey closely related to the question of finance and resource distribution. It is concluded that assessing the needs of all children and providing the resources to enable all to function effectively in society should be an important objective of current educational  policy.

The neighborhood characteristics, pupil assignment policies, instructional programs, and other circumstances that have contributed to that stability are also determined. Several alternative definitions of &quot;stable racial mix&quot; are given, and these definitions are then applied to enrollment statistics for every public school in Illinois. Illinois schools meeting stated criteria are then classified according to various enrollment and locational attributes. From this universe, forty schools are selected for a detailed field investigation and personal interviews. Conclusions are derived regarding those factors which appear to promote stable racial mix  under a variety of community and neighborhood circumstances. The applicability of desegregation techniques and the lessons learned from their implementation in the forty case study schools to additional Illinois schools are also considered.

Staff members are free to use whatever techniques they choose and to purchase instructional materials, which they match to clearly defined objectives. Teachers and aides plan a variety of activities for each child focused on two or three specific skills that the child needs to work on. It is recommended that Project Catch-Up should  be selected for a particular school district only if it can meet project requirements in the areas of instruction, management, and communication, and organization, and if resources in the following areas are available: (1) personnel, (2) material/equipment, and, (3) facilities.

        "description":"Forty randomly selected, nonvolunteer, low achieving ninth graders selected from four classes in an inner city junior high school, were assigned the role of tutor to elementary school children in order to determine if this practice was promising as a method of compensatory education. In three of the four classrooms, the tutors and nontutors received the initial instruction together for three days. The instruction covered eleven objectives in fractions and the addition of fractions. For the next three weeks, tutors spent their math period tutoring fourth graders at a nearby elementary school, while nontutors worked in class practicing the same work that the tutors were teaching. These students formed a competing-treatment control group. Tutors from the remaining classroom were  pulled out of class for the initial instruction, and students left in this fourth class continued to receive their regular math curriculum. They did not study the eleven objectives, and these students formed the no-treatment control group. Among the conclusions of the study drawn from results observed are the following: (1) this role change intervention was qualitatively different from other approaches that had been tried; (2) having to teach did produce learning in the teacher; (3) this intervention faced up to the responsibility of the schools to teach basic skills; and (4) this intervention affected secondary school children and elementary school children simultaneously. The study suggests that, initially at least, tutoring should be an assigned rather than a voluntary activity.  (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This paper recognizes the need to educate children, especially immigrant pupils, and adults for life in a multiracial society, while making observations on a British select committee report on race relations and immigration. The paper accepts the committee's view that many of those born in Great Britain who belong to minority ethnic groups will experience difficulties which must receive special attention from the education service in that country; and also that others, too, including many children and adults of indigenous origin, have particular problems to which the education service must respond. The pattern for special help provided by the government is said to take care of all those suffering educational disadvantage, taking account of the distinct needs of different ethnic  groups and of individuals, whatever their origin. The need for local authorities and schools to identify individual children who fall into this category is stressed. It is also noted that the success of government policies on education of the disadvantaged does not depend so much on the government as on the local education authorities, the teaching profession, and voluntary agencies. The latter part of the paper discusses specific recommendations of the select committee report such as that: (1) a good command of the English language should be a priority; (2) the strengthening of careers advisory services should be stressed; and (3) a survey of the various methods of dealing with the education of immigrant children in English should be conducted.

In 1970, when the study was undertaken, the NYC had just been redesigned to place more emphasis on education, skill training, and supportive services and less on work experience; and to concentrate on 16-and 17- year old school dropouts. One purpose of the research was to compare the new design program (NYC-2) with the old program (NYC-1). The selection of programs to study was based on considerations of their size, location, component characteristics, and research receptivity. Two of the programs (Cincinnati and St. Louis) had participated in a  longitudinal study of NYC-1 programs. Overall results did not indicate the NYC-2 programs were more effective than NYC-1 programs in achieving employability for enrollees. The fact that study subjects often failed to utilize existing program resources suggested that the prospects for substantial improvement are more closely associated with policies of enrollee selection and retention. The limitation of NYC-2 programs to 16- and 17-year-old youth tended to overload the site programs with poorly-motivated and underachieving trainees. (Author/JM)",

Three factors are discussed which are said to produce considerable difficulties in linking schools as such and disadvantaged areas; (1) the lack of homogeneity of the census tracts from a socioeconomic and cultural viewpoint, (2) the coexistence of three school networks in each census tract, and (3) the divergence between the boundaries of the school feeder areas of those of the census districts. In view of these problems, it was considered patent that there was only one way to identify schools in which a considerable proportion  of the students come from disadvantaged areas. It was a question of establishing the socioeconomic and cultural profile of the feeder area population of each and every school which serves part or all of one or more of the census tracts that include a disadvantaged area, while taking into account the particular network to which each school belongs--that is, the language and/or religious characteristics of the school. The method by which this has been carried out is examined step by step. (Author/JM)",

The original interviews were conducted in 1959, 1960, and 1961. In 1971, seventy-four percent of the original respondents were located again and interviewed. Mexican American respondents were at the \"low\" end of the scale and Anglos at the \"high\" end. Results from the 1971 re-interviews revealed that significant convergence had taken place. Mexican American males, females in high income Mexican American families, and Negroes, regardless of sex but more so those in high income then low income families, expressed views more like those of the Anglos than  in 1960. When world view was regressed on a variety of background and experimental variables, most of the individual variation in world view among members of each race/ethnic group remained unexplained. This suggests that while members of minority groups are not alike in their responses to statements about world view, the most readily measurable antecedent experiences which supposedly account for within group differences are not as important as more idiosyncratic, unmeasured life experiences.

        "description":"This guide for teaching school staff about conflict management is a series of unit modules or minicourses which can be combined to form a program of instruction. This is said to allow the training program to provide remedial or advanced materials for those staff members who need or desire them. Each unit includes a content area, objectives, and related competencies, training activities, training resources, and evaluation. The first two units, on understanding conflict, define conflict and focus on conflict in desegregated school settings. The remaining six units, on managing conflict in desegregated school settings, deal with such topics as recognizing ethnic and cultural differences, understanding academic achievement among ethnic minority and culturally different students,  understanding linguistic differences, preparing schools for desegregation, and developing a pluralistic academic curriculum. Materials appended include an outline of an instructional program on conflict management, a guide to problem solving in a desegregated school setting, an example of a role playing simulation on the dynamics of school conflict, and a list of goals for human understanding in conflict situations.

        "description":"Role-taking skills of ethnic minority children were studied to determine the effect of conflict in the self-identification process on the ability to adopt the perspectives of another person. The subjects were Canadian Indian children around the age of eight for whom there was evidence of conflicting ethnic identification tendencies. These children were asked to attribute the desirability of uncles from four different ethnic groups to peers from their own and other ethnic groups. One peer from each of these categories spoke English and a second peer spoke a non-English language. It was found that, contrary to studies with Swiss, British, and American whites, these Indian children were able to take accurately the role of peers from both a liked and a disliked ethnic group. These  results are discussed in terms of the conflicting pressures on ethnic minority children as they develop an awareness of their own ethnic affiliations, and the effects of such conflict on role-taking. A secondary aim of this study was to determine whether the attribution of preference to another was based on egocentric attitudes or on perceived similarity of peer and uncle. Multiple regression analyses indicated that neither of these factors contributed significantly to role-taking judgments. (Author/JM)",

Language is examined on the basis of a model which specifies that the following characteristics of family environments influence language development most: quality of language usage of the mother, opportunities for the enlargement and use of vocabulary and sentence patterns, and parents' keeness for correct and effective language usage. Twenty middle class and twenty lower class children were administered the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. An interview was conducted with mothers. Results show that the middle SES group scored significantly higher than the lower SES group on the language test, and had a greater press for  language development in the home. However, it was found that social status variables were as effective as the environmental process characteristics in predicting language ability. An alternative model is suggested for future research which specifies that family environments should be analyzed according to the stimuli parents provide, the nature of the reinforcement for appropriate performance, and parents' expectations for a child's performance.

The United States instituted this school desegregation suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas pursuant to Section 407 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. On September 4, 1970, the District Court entered an interim order directing AISD to implement  standard provisions requiring desegregating districts in the Fifth circuit to eliminate racial discrimination in several aspects of school operations. After a six-day trial in 1971, the District Court held that AISD had not discriminated against Mexican Americans. The Court of Appeals reversed this decision. On remand, the District Court once more concluded that the AISD had not discriminated against Mexican Americans. A panel of the Court of Appeals reversed again. It remanded for the formulation of an appropriate plan for complete desegregation. After arguing the brief for the United States, it is submitted that United States of America, et al., do not oppose the granting of the petition for a writ of certiorari. (Author/JM)",

The first presentation discusses childhood social indicators as means of monitoring the ecology of development. The second, on the social context of childhood, shows that how society treats its youngest members depends both upon its perception of what children are like and its perception of what is required for effective functioning of society itself. The value of children to parents and the decrease in family size is the subject of the third paper. This paper notes that in order to predict fertility trends and birth rates, one needs to understand the motivational factors underlying the desire to have children and to analyze these motivations in relation to other social  conditions--such as analyzing the needs that children satisfy, as well as costs (both emotional and financial) that are involved in parenthood. The fourth paper, on \"reality and research in the ecology of human development\", documents the changes over time that have been taking place in one enduring context which is critical for human development--i.e., the family. The final paper focuses on mounting effective child advocacy. (Author/JM)",

Korean entrepreneurs concentrate heavily in trade and service. Their businesses are small in size and rely little on wage labor. Their clientele is not confined to the ethnic community. These characteristic suggests that Koreans serve as an example of the role of middleman minorities in advanced capitalism. Three possible forces within U.S. monopoly capitalism which encourage Koreans to enter small business are considered. The first is that the  system helps to create Korean small business, (1) using Koreans to play a middleman role to the masses, especially low income minorities, (2) helping to distribute corporate profits, and, (3) bearing the brunt of hostility, crime, and low profits accruing to retailers in poor areas. The second approach is to see the monopoly capitalism as somewhat porous, leaving niches which the enterprising small businessman can take advantage of. A third interpretation is that Koreans actively create small business niches within monopoly capitalism. (Author/JM)",

The program operates under three goals: (1) To aid in developing self-awareness and responsibility, (2) to aid in developing an understanding of technology and the world-of-work, and (3) to enhance the learning process. Interest learning, children-tools and learning, classroom organization, and developing a safety philosophy are discussed. Ideas, suggestions, and references are provided for these sections. The guide contains 22 interest areas, ranging from automation to tool  making. Each interest area describes an idea/problem, procedures for examining the idea/problem, materials and equipment need, and follow-up. To supplement the guide, a list of materials and sources (available at minimal cost to the teacher) is provided, as well as a list of suggested resources for material and equipment.

(The work carried out by radiologic technologists, and administrative, machine-related, and nursing-type functions are found in Volumes 2 and 3. Volume 4 is an index of all the tasks in the three volumes.) The first three volumes present the tasks in a given area in numerical order by code number. These task descriptions are offered for use as instructional materials, as inputs to the design of career ladders, for the structuring of jobs and assignment of work to job titles, and as inputs to the development of performance evaluation instruments and proficiency  tests. Chapter I of this volume defines &quot;task&quot; and tells how the descriptions were developed. The task descriptions are presented in Chapter 3 by Code Number, the steps of the task described in logical sequence in considerable detail. Chapter 2 is a guide to the tasks, arranged in logical grouping for easy reference: (1) By system of the body, (2) by function (e.g., consultations, procedures, teaching), and (3) by main type of recipient (e.g., patient, pediatric patient, student, etc.).

Descriptions are given of the Preparation file, containing information specifying various ways to prepare for a particular occupation; the Program file, which describes a complete array of educational and training programs; and the School file, which provides comprehensive institutional information such as degrees offered, financial aid, and housing. It is reported that the educational components were field tested to determine their value to individuals making career decisions, and that response of CIS users indicated that the components were easy to use, relevant to users' career planning, comprehensive in the  scope of information provided, and well integrated with the rest of CIS. Also, the expanded system was found to have substantial impact on occupational and educational choices. The adult market for career information and the impact of CIS on other agencies are also analyzed. (Author/TA)",

A search of the literature supplied information on the past use of independent study programs in vocational education and other areas. Factors related to the acceptance, cost, and development of independent study programs were reviewed. A model, which recognized the stages of development for a correspondence study course, was established and used to facilitate the construction of an auto-mechanics correspondence course which was field tested with 33 students, the object being to determine the effectiveness of such independent study programs. By the conclusion of the project, students had not completed a sufficient number of lessons to determine the  feasibility of the particular course. However, in responding to a follow-up questionnaire, students cited two main disadvantages of the program as being: (1) The problem of acquiring tools, and (2) the lack of immediate feedback for questions and completed lessons. Other conclusions, recommendations, and a l1-page bibliography are also given. Appendices contain a list of vocational correspondence courses available from different institutions, recommended subjects for vocational correspondence study courses, and the questionnaires used in the project.

        "description":"The study seeks to expand the occupational information available to educators by relating job openings data to information about the earnings of persons employed in different occupations, their educational attainment, and the opportunities individual fields are expected to offer for women and nonwhites. The data refer to 123 occupations including those related to all the major federally-supported vocational programs. The report presents historical data and projections to 1980 and 1985 which are consistent with the U. S. Department of Labor's economic growth model. The data base includes published and unpublished decennial census data, current population survey reports, and Office of Education and other enrollment data. The research indicates that the vocational enrollments tend  to be concentrated in programs related to occupations with median earnings below those of the overall labor force. The occupational distribution for women is projected to change slowly in the next decade with somewhat greater shifts for nonwhites. The major changes in educational attainment are expected to take place in the less skilled occupations. Vocational enrollments have become more labor market oriented. However, there is a high ratio of enrollments to anticipated job openings in the agricultural fields, and a low ratio in the health and distribution fields. Appendixes (121 pages) contain the national projections, replicability of the national projections for the states of Kentucky and New Jersey, and the statistical tables. (Author/RG)",

Reported results indicate an overall acceptance of career education and general agreement that the programs had expanded student awareness of career opportunities. It is noted that questionnaires used in the projects show a need for improved communication, for expanded in-service training, and for more systematic evaluative procedures. Lists of major materials  developed in each district are appended to the report. Evaluations of the projects by the Center for Human Resources of the University of Houston comprise two-thirds of the document. Data and summary comments are presented for each district. Evaluation activities, which included visits to each participating school and interviews with administrators, counselors, and teachers, are reported. Interview forms and responses are appended to the evaluation report. (TA)",

        "description":"This report focuses on the problem of how to improve leadership effectiveness in order to improve overall organization effectiveness. First, three different approaches to leadership behavior are presented: Trait Approach, Behavioral Approach, and Situational Approach. Next, reviews of the leadership literature and of eight contingency models of leadership are presented. Finally, the three-component Leadership Effectiveness Model, developed on the basis of the eight models and the literature review, is described and critiqued. The Model considers leadership effectiveness to be a function of the criterion selected, the leadership style employed, and the situational environment(s), which includes the leader's subordinates, peers, and other personnel in the environment. The basis for  selecting these three components was that they were found to be common across most of the leadership literature reviewed, and at the same time they provide a useful descriptive framework for depicting leadership as a decision-making process. It is concluded that leadership can best be depicted as a decision-making process which involves the leader, the followers, the situation, and the criterion of effectiveness. (TA)",

        "description":"One objective of the research was to identify career ladders with the greatest potential for improving retention. This study revealed that a regression model, which takes into account airmen career status and months of service while holding constant aptitude differences, can be used to display cross-sectional attitude data in a longitudinal fashion. From the displayed regression profiles, it is feasible to infer career-ladder relationships between job attitudes and tenure or career decisions. A characteristic increase in job attitude immediately after the reenlistment decision point in cross-sectional data reflects a &quot;residualization process&quot; whereby those dissatisfied with their jobs tend to leave the Air Force while more satisfied airmen remain. The increase reflects the impact  of job attitude on career decisions and is not due to alternative &quot;dissonance theory&quot; or changes in intrinsic motivation explanations. The cross-sectional profiles provide a means of identifying specialties with the greatest potential for job reengineering where the goal is to positively improve retention through providing progressively more satisfying jobs.

From a discussion of studies done on sex-role stereotyping in the schools, the suggestion is made that the occupational information to which young people are exposed is biased and that a traditional stereotypical approach to career awareness exists in schools. Furthermore, a review of the literature reveals that stereotyping of occupations along sex lines starts at an early age, first in the home, and later as children come into contact with workers in the school, community, and  media. It is concluded that the need to broaden the occupational knowledge of both teachers and students is crucial if the elements of career guidance are to pervade the school curricula and if the present movement for sex equality on both job attainment and job equality is to become a reality.

The report provides statistical data concerning the age, race, and marital status of families with women as heads of households. Included also is data on labor force participation, occupations, children, and income of female heads of households in comparison to men. Conclusions drawn from the data include these: The number of poor families headed by women is continuously rising, while that of men is  steadily falling, and for several million of these women the barriers impeding the climb continue to be inadequate training and education for the current job market, and, in some cases, heavy child care responsibilities.

Peer group aides and staff of the Careers Project at Northside Center for Child Development worked with a control group to facilitate preparation for employment. Analysis shows that practically every member of the experimental control group held a job at some point during the program as compared with slightly more than one-third of the control group. Whether the young women were in school or out of school, and had looked for a job or had not looked for a job made differences in their view of job possibilities and of education. The peer group mechanism seemed effective in dealing with some aspects of the interplay among  race, sex, and age in work behavior and expectations. (Author/WL)",

Major findings and recommendations showed and suggested that: (1) The more effective teams are those that deemphasize the separation among job position specialties in distributing the teams' work activities; (2) guidelines for staffing of WIN teams should consider four basic job position specialties  instead of the current five. (These four are coach, counselor, job developer, and the clerical position. The work-training specialist position was deleted.); (3) it is important that all team members receive team training as a necessary condition for its impact on team performance; and (4) teams located in areas of relatively low unemployment routinely refer enrollees considered not job-ready to WIN Orientation and use this period of enrollment to interact with them in developing employability goals and plans.

The PCI is based on actual performance criteria developed through cooperation with police officials in nine cities throughout the country. It measures how well an individual might handle four different police jobs--patrol officer, patrol sergeant, investigator-detective, and mid-level commander. This easily administered, objectively scored written test screens out high-risk applicants. Those who register borderline scores are referred to a regional assessment center  where a series of police job simulations elicit behavioral indicators of potential for success in various aspects of police work. Local departments may wish to consider the 2-fold system, tested with good results in several cities. About half of this report consists of description of the research to develop and validate the PCI and the assessment center exercises. Appendixes include job description booklets for precinct patrolman, investigative personnel, sergeants, and intermediate commanders (about 50 pages). The remainder is research data tables. (TA)",

        "description":"Career education and work experience education are discussed in terms of the common goal of education as preparation for work, and three basic common values: (1) The importance of work to both individuals in society and to society itself, (2) the need for and potential of experiential learning, and (3) the need to involve the formal education system and the business-labor-industry-professional community in a collaborative relationship in ways that will expand student learning opportunities. Basic career education concepts are compared with work experience concepts. The concept of work, as a humanizing term, is discussed, along with implications for change in the role and function of work experience educators. The goal of this paper is to provide work experience educators with  some basis for determining their own directions for professional change growing out of the career education concept. One point noted is that the career education concept considers work experience, in addition to that found in classrooms per se, to be an important opportunity to be made available to all students.

Once the pressure is removed, the organization will reassume its original shape. Basic change in organizational structure is accomplished only when the key functionaries within that organization make an internal commitment to change.\" The author believes that when applied to American education, this principle addresses the need for internal changes in commitment among professional educators. How the principle is being accommodated in 1l basic strategies for accomplishing change embodied in the career education concept  (which is seen as a positive application of the principle) is illustrated. Finally, a plea is made for continuing collaborative efforts on behalf of career education, which if successful will motivate professional educators and the public to decide for themselves to change the nature, structure, format, and delivery system of American education at all levels.

The charges are rebutted with the intention of illustrating the positive contributions that vocational education can make to the goals of career education. It is noted that any long-run strategy (for solving the education/work dilemma in general, or the problems of the underemployed in particular) that ignores or fails to take full advantage of vocational education will be both unwise and unproductive. Vocational education is not viewed as the sole answer, but as an essential element in a total career education strategy since, according to the author, the career education  concept would never be made an operational reality unless all concerned with this movement recognize and embrace the goals and objectives of vocational education.

That is why, from the beginning, career education has been pictured as a collaborative effort involving educators, the business-labor-industry community, and the home and family structure. Career education is needed for two basic reasons: (1) The world of schooling and the world of paid employment are out of kilter in the United States, and (2) the increasingly technological nature of society and rapid rate of change make it necessary that persons seeking to work be equipped with a combination of adaptability skills that will help them with change, and a set of job-specific skills that will enable them to enter the  labor market. In its simplest form, career education is an attempt to help all individuals want to work, acquire the skills necessary to work in these times, and engage in work that is satisfying to the individual and beneficial to society. If the business-labor-industry community will join actively in this effort, it can become a reality. (TA)",

The leader style of female college students was measured by means of the Least Preferred Coworker (LPC) Scale, which identifies relationship-motivated, task-motivated, and independence-oriented leaders. To test if subject behaviors vary with the favorableness of the situation and the person's LPC score, an In-basket simulation was constructed. A 2 x 2 x 3 factorial design manipulated high  and low position power (2) and training (2), and used subjects with high, middle, and low LPC scores (3). Dependent measures were seven behavior categories based on the subjects' displayed behaviors, scores on an uncertainty scale, and scores on the Wonderlic Personnel Test of educational achievement. Statistical analyses were performed to test three hypotheses. Conclusions from the findings include these: (1) Directing and pleading are situationally determined behaviors while searching for information as well as threatening and criticizing are the result of interaction between the situation and the personality of the subject, and (2) a relatively short and non-intense training program resulted in a search for information under different conditions. Data analysis and suggestions for  further research are included in the report. A 20-item bibliography and four evaluation scales are appended: Manipulation check questions, group atmosphere scale, LPC scale, and uncertainty scale. (JT)",

Each investigation produced substantial support for the use of such models suggesting that both theories can provide practical insights for occupational guidance and counseling. While theoretical, mathematical, and methodological differences exist among these approaches, they are based on a fairly similar, rational maximization principle. They assume that people will choose the occupations they believe will result in the greatest amount of benefit to them, provided there is a good chance they can actually attain a position in the occupation. The results of studies in occupational guidance and counseling are congruent with the  foregoing. Providing people with accurate information about jobs and job outcomes facilitates adjustment and reduces turnover. The expectancy and expected value models provide solid, explicit ways in which people might use the information, their values, and expectations about the future in order to make the &quot;best&quot; possible choices; these models seem to be highly predictive.

Through a systematic use of peer instruction in job simulation, the need for additional teachers and instructional materials is eliminated; peer instruction is also a low-risk, high-return instructional medium. Quality control in using the peer-instructional system is the responsibility of the qualified  teacher. Establishment of flexible managerial capabilities within the system allows for efficient use of facilities and equipment, and precludes the need for additional expenditures in this direction. In addition, this flexibility provides ease of management in adjusting the system to accommodate increases or decreases in student population and in the type and depth of curriculum.

On a statewide basis, two major objectives were to be accomplished: (1) Help all public and private schools in South Dakota implement career education programs, and (2) provide every student an opportunity to develop self awareness, a favorable attitude toward work, and to develop and practice decision making skills. The project was designed to serve the K-14 student enrollment; in addition, the project worked with post-secondary vocational-technical schools in the area of placement. There were five major components in the project: Guidance and counseling, elementary career awareness, junior high-middle school, job preparation (Grades 10-14), and placement activities. In-service seminars for  counselors were conducted and follow-up sessions were held with participating schools after in-service sessions had been completed with time allowed for the schools to begin implementation. Program evaluation focused only on student outcomes, while more direct facets of the program received wide support throughout the state. It was concluded that the direction of career education in South Dakota has been established at all levels of education and that certain phases of the project had an identifiable student impact.

The Texas Career Education Measurement Series (CEMS) was used in testing ninth and twelfth grade students. It was assumed that 75% of ninth grade students and 90% of twelfth grade students should be able to master basic learner outcomes in the areas of career education. In the nine general categories of career education outcomes measured by the CEMS, both twelfth and ninth grade students ranked highest (rank 1) in  self-investigation and evaluation for career success and lowest (rank 9) in career and occupational information. Results of the statewide assessment provide objective information which is useful for suggesting areas for educational improvements. The document also includes a description of CEMS, (which consists of a survey test and 16 category tests for use in Grades 7-12).

Using data from the 1972-1973 Quality of Employment Survey, dimensions of occupational differentiation with multiple discriminant analysis are constructed and a causal model is developed to represent the interrelationships of those dimensions. It is found that the differentiation of intrinsic occupational rewards is attributable largely to the educational and task requirements of occupations, while union, supervisory, and organizational resources available to occupational groupings are the strongest determinants of the differentiation of extrinsic rewards. Implications of these findings for functional and conflict theories of inequality in occupational rewards are  discussed. (Author/HD)",

A pre- and post-evaluation design for students and staff members was used. Students and staff members in pilot career education classes were selected in each pilot site to (1) represent specific grade levels, (2) represent all or a significant number of students, and (3) complete designated cognitive subtests of the Career Maturity Inventory (CMI). Control groups were selected at two pilot sites to establish representative baseline data for the three instruments: Elementary Inventory, Career Maturity Inventory Attitude Scale, and Career Maturity Inventory  Competence Test. When viewed by level and location groups, it was noted that means and gains were near the same levels and showed varying levels of significance. When all schools were considered together, there was statistically significant gain on combined parts of each measure. It is concluded that the program, on a whole, produced statistically significant gains in the area of career education. Well-developed career education programs can be transported and installed on a region-wide basis with student gains in career awareness and career maturity probable through intervention by one of the identified career education project programs.

Fundamental differences between the Navy's military and civilian workforce analysis and planning systems are analyzed, discussion centering around the characteristic differences in the workforces, for management of which each system had come to be established. A number of alternatives for integrating these systems is discussed with a particular regard for taking full advantage of the complementary characteristics of each system. Special attention is paid to the interrelationships of the manpower requirements generating and personnel inventory analysis systems for the Naval shore establishment where  military and civilian personnel work together. Some suggestions for long range research and development are made pointing to areas in which optimal systems design can be pursued. (Author/JT)",

        "description":"Two visual monitoring tasks were used to further knowledge of the interactions between individual differences and task demands as determinants of performance and satisfaction. The subjects, 100 male university students, completed pre- and post-test batteries to assess general and specific abilities, personality variables, work orientation, motivation, and preferences for job structural attributes. Following the pre-testing, each subject performed the visual monitoring tasks--one complex and one simple. Both tasks involved monitoring slides for three 1-hour sessions for the presence of triangles or circles embedded within 60 irrelevant stimuli. The complex task (labeled high demands condition) differed from the simple task (labeled low demands condition) only with respect to the  demand placed upon cognitive abilities. Results showed that both performance and satisfaction are related to individual differences in ability as well as selected personality and preference measures. The congruence between task demands and abilities was found to be highly significant in determining these relationships. It is suggested that one way to optimize performance and satisfaction involves designing the job so that the task demands match the ability levels of the individuals from which job selection is made. Implications are also made for use of prior and present experiment results for the selection of Navy personnel. Appendixes include the task instructions for the experiment and seven different tables of correlations. (SH)",

The discussion concludes that, when career education concepts have been completely integrated into  the total fabric of all American education, the result should be abandonment of the term \"career education\" and adoption of some other major direction for educational change. The Appendix (Explanatory and Interpretive Statement), covering half of the document, illustrates what the consensus of career education leaders is about the position of career education as stated in the OE draft document.

        "description":"Career education is described as a concept designed to serve as a vehicle for educational reform in ways that will bring a more proper emphasis to \"education as preparation for work\" among basic goals of education at any level in the educational system. Several subconcepts of career education are discussed that seem to hold special relevance for change in higher education institutions: The changing relationships between education and work, the meaning of \"work,\" the importance of multiple goals, career education as a concept rather than a program, and career education as a collaborative effort between education and the business/labor/industry community. In the second part of this monograph, an idealistic model is presented to illustrate what would constitute a comprehensive  career education effort in a higher education institution, following the concepts outlined in the preceding section. Facets of the model discussed are the career education resource center; work experience, internships, and work study; teaching faculty; and curriculum. It is hoped that this paper may serve a useful purpose in helping higher education institutions, on an international scale, consider the possible utility that the career education concept holds for them.

        "description":"This collection of papers is intended to provide adult educators and administrators information that will assist in making decisions about, initiating, financing, and evaluating adult literacy programs in England. Papers in the first part of the book focus on definitions of adult literacy, examining the dimensions of the problem, the potential impact of a British Broadcasting Company television series of motivational programs on the subject, and the role of colleges in meeting community needs. In the second part, a detailed study is made of four on-going projects, one based on the Liverpool LEA, the second a college-based scheme at South Trafford College of Further Education, the third a departmental scheme based on the Department of Adult Studies at Newton-le-Willows College of  Further Education, the fourth based on an Adult Education Centre in North Trafford. The third part is concerned with the need for an understanding of the sociological and psychological background of students and their implications for diagnosis, placement, and the selection of resource materials. It includes a paper on the training of tutors. In the final part focus is on what those initiating programs can gain from the experience of projects in other contexts. Two of these papers deal with the vital necessity for resources to be committed to research, and the potential power of the public libraries in consolidating the teaching which is to be done in the near future.

Preliminary discussion includes a review of existing vocational theories and research, in particular, Holland's typology and Super's self-concept theory. It is concluded from these reviews that the practical problems in career counseling will not be solved by continuing to use the currently prevailing correlational methods. Instead, the authors suggest that several major changes of focus are needed and present a social learning model of career selection as a perspective for self-managed change (behavioral self-control). Self-control is viewed here as a series of specific, cognitively mediated actions that a person uses to regulate and  alter situations, including the cognitive environment, so that desired change takes place. Major concepts and techniques for teaching and learning self-control skills are discussed, stressing four broad areas of commitment, awareness, restructuring environments, and evaluating consequences and standards. A case study using these techniques is examined. Areas of needed research in the area of career counseling are suggested. (TA)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine whether existing work tests affected the timing and quality of jobs found after a period during which a person both received welfare benefits and had to register with the Employment Service (ES) in connection with their receipt. Six measurable aspects of a work test applicable to individuals were identified: Individuals could be (1) called into the ES office, (2) called in frequently, (3) questioned about job search activities, (4) asked for proof of job search activities, (5) referred to a job, and/or (6) pressured to accept a job. Based on a survey of 1966 Food Stamp (FS) and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Aid to Families with Dependent Children of Unemployed Fathers (AFDC-UF), the study was conducted in five cities using a  questionnaire designed to capture employment experience following a stretch of unemployment or part-time employment during which respondents received FS or AFDC/AFDC-UF benefits. Three principal concerns were (1) how the application of the work tests varied by city and within cities by type of individual; (2) how the different work tests influenced job search patterns; and (3) how they influenced employment behavior. The overall conclusion is that results of the study provide a pessimistic picture of the usefulness of existing work tests in encouraging registrants to return to work. This report organizes the findings and conclusions under each of the three principle concerns and presents general conclusions and recommendations in the form of policy alternatives. (JT)",

A necessary part of this career education program would be concerned proximity congruency vis-a-vis community resources; that is, a situation in which students are perceptually or physically exposed to the world of work. Student awareness, exposure, and skills training can be enhanced when instructional programs are structured to provide a balance between pre-employment and psychomotor development, and skills application in real world of work situations. Instructional materials, career education resource  centers, and a CE professional staff are also important components of a fully operational CE program. The career education coordinator position can be a means of mobilizing the support of the world of work community behind efforts to create and provide career education awareness, exploration, and skills training to students in rural systems.

The first of two basic goals of this research was to test, at the purely phonetic level, the \"critical period for language learning\" hypothesis (Lenneberg, 1967). The second problem was to see if students could acquire the linguistic features associated with \"language accent\" with no reference to grammar or lexical meaning. Both questions are considered, with special attention to the concrete results of the study and to their implications. The final section of the paper includes a discussion of the acoustic image imprinting theory, which is the basis for  the method used to teach phonetic material in this experiment. (Author)",

A careful contrastive analysis can make quite precise predictions about the substitution that is made, the learners who make such substitutions and the circumstances under which the substitution is most common. However, it is argued that for the present case a contrastive analysis of the conventional kind, comparing native and target language as static systems, is useless. What is required is a sociolinguistic analysis of the native  language, as it is a pattern of sociolinguistic variation which is being transferred to English. (Author)",

Methodologies are outlined which would allow Spanish-speaking children to be taught in heterogeneous settings. In the latter, the four phases of the development of a compliance plan are outlined, and bilingual education at the secondary level is briefly discussed. \"A Perspective of Oral Language Development in Federal Programs,\" by Kay Jagoda Caragonne, contrasts ESL language development,  oral language development in general, and oral language development in bilingual education. \"PAL Measures Language Dominance\" and \"BSM Assesses Linguistic Proficiency in English/Spanish,\" by Sylvia Gil, discuss the goals, construction, administration, and scoring of the Primary Acquisition of Languages Oral Language Dominance Measure and the Bilingual Syntax Measure. \"Appreciating Linguistic Varieties,\" by Nancy Flores, discusses socially stigmatized language varieties in terms of bilingual education. \"Implementation of Innovations in Multicultural Education,\" by Blandina Cardenas, deals with the organizational and human relations needs of educational institutions implementing bilingual/multicultural education.

Problems in the comprehension of these instructions include the memory load that they impose, the fact that most instructions are read only once, and the fact that instructions are written in legal language, with vocabulary, syntax and semantic usage unfamiliar to the average juror. The purpose of the study is to isolate the lexical, grammatical, semantic and pragmatic factors which impede comprehension. The study attempts to get at what jurors actually comprehend and remember when they hear a jury instruction, by having them paraphrase jury instructions. Thirty-five jurors called for jury duty in Prince George's County,  Maryland, but who had as yet not served, were divided into four groups and presented on a one-to-one basis with three practice instructions and eleven test instructions. In addition, a type of phrase-structure analysis was used to break the instructions into their constituent meanings to isolate factors impeding comprehension. Results are given for two instructions; they reveal that comprehension difficulties do exist and that there are discrepancies between lawyers' and jurors' judgements of instruction difficulty.

It was proposed that Latin instruction with strong emphasis on relating English words to their Latin roots and affixes would strengthen reading skills, in terms of speed, accuracy, word recognition, and comprehension. The pilot study was directed at fifth and sixth graders, and instruction was via audiolingual techniques with audiolingual-visual materials. Students were pre- and post-tested with the Science Research Associates Assessment Survey reading subtests, and with the vocabulary, comprehension, speed, and accuracy subtests of the Gates-MacGintie Reading Tests and the Slosson Oral  Reading Test. Statistical results do not justify the institution of a Latin curriculum in elementary schools for the express purpose of increasing English reading skills, although classroom teachers, principals, counsultants and administrators found the pilot program effective. Curricular materials used in the pilot project, sample conversations, games, survey questionnaires, and a list of resource materials follow the report. Curricular materials are divided into units, each including class activities, work sheets, games, puzzles, copies of transparencies, illustrations, and tests. (CLK)",

In a few communities,  field research projects of a larger range should be supported, projects in which an ethnographer works with staff and community members on a specific diagnosis of incompatibilities between the interactional styles of community and school, and suggests directions for change and then helps to monitor the results; (4) all school systems should bring the invisible culture of the community into the school through parent participation, hiring and promotion of minority group personnel, and inservice training for the school staff.

The content validity and criterion-related validity of standardized tests is considered. Disproportionate distribution of scores for particular cultural groups indicates bias in test materials, rather than significant differences in actual subject capability. Examination of the issue from a sociolinguistic perspective includes consideration of differences in linguistic forms which speakers may have as a part of their linguistic system, testing as a social situation, and task bias. A test user should know: (1) whether the test measures what it claims to measure; (2) what the assumptions  underlying the testing task are; (3) what problems will be encountered by speakers of non-mainstream varieties of English and how to interpret results of such speakers; (4) how accessible information on individual test items is; and (5) what justifiable classifications and assessments can be made, given the tests' potential for sociolinguistic bias. The speech clinician should know the linguistic characteristics and the verbal styles and functions of local non-mainstream varieties, and should develop an awareness of the role of the speech pathologist in dealing with dialect differences.

Communicative competence is defined as what native speakers know which enables them to interact effectively with each other. Implications for the language teacher include: (1) the need for tests which measure the ability to use language; (2) the irrelevancy of sequencing surface features; (3) the need for emphasis on non-linguistic aspects of communication; and (4) the need to re-examine attitudes toward  students and language teaching. Practical suggestions for implementing communicative competence in the classroom include the use of spontaneous role-playing, discussions, games, radio, and the telephone. (AM)",

Theories concerning the psychology of second language learning which have been hypothesized by a small number of people in the field are discussed. These theories were first reported on from Scotland and England and have recently made their way into American linguistic circles. A project is described in which the conversations of five second language learners who were studying English as a second language (ESL) at Bronx Community College in the summer of 1975 were taped, transcribed and analyzed. The learners' uses of \"don't\" as a generalized negating device are outlined. The results of an analysis of these learners' use of auxiliaries, negatives and  question formation, along with a comparative study of the results of other researchers after studying these same three linguistic subsystems, conclude the study.

        "description":"To help assess the writing ability of college freshmen studying English as a second language (ESL), this study was undertaken to identify particular structures of subordination associated with writing maturity and to develop a diagnostic instrument to test student control of those structures. Following sentence-generating principles of transformational grammar, the developed examination, entitled Test of Ability to Subordinate (TAS), offers test items in the form of pairs or triads of kernel or &quot;core&quot; sentences which students are asked to combine into one sentence by filling in missing words in a given sentence frame. The 50-item, limited-response examination was administered to a number of ESL college freshmen along with the Michigan Test of English Language Proficiency and a  composition exercise. The TAS correlated .86 with scores on the Michigan Test and .74 with composition scores. The study suggests that: (l) certain structures of subordination appear to be critical elements of overall writing ability; (2) it is possible to construct valid objective tests which ask students to actively engage in writing sentences as well as in a cognitive process required in free writing; and (3) the ability to produce certain transformations through sentence combining is indicative of the ability to perform these transformations during the normal writing process.

The traditional approach to language instruction has generally underestimated this aspect of learning and its importance. The counseling-learning method relies on untapped sources within the student as positive factors, including the innate desire to learn. The psychological blocks inherent in the authoritarian nature of the normal classroom situation are removed. Examples are drawn from an intensive summer German program offered at Miami University's branch campus in Luxembourg. Thirteen students had four contact hours of instruction daily, five days a week. The teaching method centers around the use of a tape recorder. Students  begin recording themselves in the target language from the beginning of the course, and the recordings are used as instructional materials and as sources for grammar lessons. The role of the teacher is modified to that of a resource person who functions as a counselor. The student determines his own needs and thereby the pace and presentation of subject matter. Results showed the students' command of German after six weeks to be equal to, if not better than that of students completing a regular first-year university program. (CLK)",

Schlessinger (1970) has shown, for example, that users of sign language have difficulty in communicating syntactic relations such as \"subject of main verb,\"\"object of the verb,\" and \"indirect object.\" The major hypothesis under investigation in the study reported here is that a significant, though not total, congenital hearing impairment should result in an inability to handle complex aspects of syntax in the comprehension of sentences. Twenty hard-of-hearing children were used (13 males and 7 females, ages 9.5 to 19.4 years) all regular students in the Duval County, Florida, public school system. Each subject heard and saw  twenty sentences, and was asked to point to one of four accompanying pictures which most accurately depicted the events described in a given sentence. Twenty trials were run at a single session for each subject. Results appear to verify the hypothesis, and it is further suggested that the hard-of-hearing language user may, perhaps in order to compensate for the syntactic deficit, rely heavily on probabilistic strategies in comprehension.

Linguists are becoming aware of the moral and social implications of their efforts in the field of bilingual education within the larger context of social engineering, and they need to explore language-related issues in a broader framework which necessarily transcends the confines of academic training. Bilingual education is not the domain of any particular discipline at the present time; rather it extends into cognitive psychology, educational linguistics, educational foundations, and social history. Some issues in these areas of scholarship are reviewed in general terms by way of introduction to non-linguistic solutions to language-related problems. The melting  pot hypothesis, seen as favoring the biological and cultural amalgamation of northern Europeans in America to the exclusion of other groups, is discussed, as well as what is termed the myth of social mobility, whereby the public school system is seen as the basic instrument by which the working class can advance within the social structure of American life. Arguments to refute this myth are presented. A final issue concerns differences in cognitive styles among children, and resulting discrimination against non-mainstream children. (Author/CLK)",

Following a discussion of the historical and educational background of New Mexico State University, the foreign student background is described, and features that characterize the varieties of English spoken by these students are listed. Since few foreign students succeed in regular freshman English composition courses, the  university has a special English program. Admission and placement of foreign students is discussed, and comparison is made with courses in Spanish for native Spanish-speaking Americans. Three basic needs are defined: (1) greater intelligibility in speech, (2) greater intelligibility in writing, and (3) a greater sociolinguistic range in terms of knowing the rules that govern interaction and conversation in American English. It is hoped that the existing English course for foreign students can be revised to meet these needs. (CLK)",

The latter issue was tested in a study in which native speakers of American English rated voices according to personality traits. Two of the four diagnostic voices were native speakers of American English, one with no pronounced regional or class grammatical markers, the other with strong east-Texas pronunciation and accompanying grammatical markers. Two other voices were both native speakers of Jordanian Arabic, one devoid of American English regional markers and the other having them. By far the greatest number of  negative evaluations went to the Jordanian Arabic speaker who used many American English regionalisms. In order to develop linguistically defensible attitudes in their students, language teachers must be familiar with regional markers. Methods to develop sensitivity to language variation include using novels and other popular reading materials, having the students bring their own examples, and having students paraphrase examples as an exercise in style-shifting.

Linguistic documentation is lacking to accurately evaluate the linguistic competence of the bilingual student, documentation also useful in the preparation of adequate instructional materials. This paper describes some morphosyntactic variants in the Spanish of bilinguals in Texas, and compares these variants to equivalents in Latin American Spanish. Data for the study come from questionnaires administered to second- and third-generation Mexican-American university students, the focus being the morphosyntax of the verb phrase. Phonological variation, including vowel reduction, vowel alternation, consonant reduction, verbal inflection, and variation  due to the influence of English, is discussed. Morphosyntactic variation includes reduction in the use of certain tenses and alternation between moods, and can be explained partially in terms of semantic and contextual factors. Phonological and morphological variation is the result of a simplification process eliminating non-meaningful distinctions or irregular forms. This process occurs where the pressure exerted by educational institutions and other cultural establishments making for linguistic homogeneity is absent. It is present also in some Latin American dialects of Spanish. Syntactic variation is due to a restructuring process in which the influence of English is clear. (CLK)",

The general theme is that attitudes of understanding and tolerance can lead to substantive improvements in professional morale and classroom effectiveness. Emphasizing the different regional factors and cultural sources of many areas known to be problematic, the paper identifies and analyzes such attitudinal and perceptual concepts as time, &quot;never-say-no-ism,&quot; expatriate feelings of temporariness and alienation, education as a perceived value, the image of teachers, and the role and image of women. Factors affecting linguistic pre-conditionings and their effects on teaching are evaluated as well. Drawing upon the accumulated and  multi-national experiences of English teachers in Libya (case study), Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab countries, the paper also examines various practical aspects of teaching which include coeducation, familiarity with students, cheating, and the role of EFL in the curriculum. In addition, advice is provided for dealing with bureaucracies. Appended to the paper is a list of suggested readings which treat relevant linguistic and regional topics. (Author/CLK)",

First, a method is demonstrated for eliciting a representative communication sample of a student's speech or writing, using pictorial stimuli. Second, a practical taxonomy is presented for classifying student errors in communicative and linguistic terms. Third, an actual written composition demonstrates step-by-step how to classify, code, and chart these errors systematically. Finally, suggestions indicate ways in which the ESL teacher can use error charts to obtain four different kinds of information about his students' spoken and written proficiency. (Author/AM)",

Students were identified as having high or low communicative proficiency and were randomly assigned to one of two error correction treatments based on Burt and Kiparsky's global/local error distinction: correction of global errors only, or correction of global and local errors. Once a week for six consecutive weeks students wrote picture story descriptions in English and had their errors corrected according to assigned treatment. It was found that most communicative (&quot;global&quot;) errors resulted from inadequate lexical knowledge, misuse of prepositions and pronouns, and  seriously misspelled words. Most linguistic (&quot;local&quot;) errors were caused by inappropriate lexical choice, misuse and omission of prepositions, misspelled words, lack of subject-verb agreement, and faulty word order. An analysis of variance revealed no significant differences in students' writing proficiency attributable to error correction treatment or to grouping according to communicative ability. (Author)",

        "description":"In a sociolinguistic study of the verb phrase in Southern White English, a pattern of change in progress was observed. The 14 variables studied showed that certain variants were increasing, others decreasing, and yet others stable across time within the community, and that each variable's change was progressing in a wave sensitive to age, social class, sex, and rural/urban origins. It is possible that these apparent changes were a reflection of age grading, since there are no earlier records of speech in that community. However, the variants that are decreasing are all older forms of English than those which are increasing and are dying or nonexistent outside Southern White and Black English. This suggests that age grading is not the primary factor here, but rather language  change moving through the community. The variables examined were the standard and nonstandard variants of NP plural agreement; plural &quot;was,&quot;&quot;is&quot;; singular &quot;don't&quot;; irregular preterits and past participles; &quot;ain't&quot;; negative concord; passive &quot;be&quot; and &quot;got&quot;; perfective &quot;done&quot;; &quot;a+verb+ing&quot;; double modals; &quot;liketa&quot;; and negative inversion. The data base consisted of tape-recorded interviews with 65 natives of Anniston, Alabama, and nearby rural areas. The informants were teenagers and adults over 65 of the working and upper classes.

These programs include the Federally Insured Student Loan program, the National Direct Student Loan program, the College Work-Study program, and the Basic and Supplemental Educational Opportunity programs, all established by Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 as amended in 1972. Recently, the Federal government has favored a policy of increased reliance on state agencies to provide improved postsecondary student consumer protection in the operation of the financial aid programs (with regard to institutional practices and occasional  instances of impropriety or educational malpractice). The major purpose of the study outlined will be to provide an accurate appraisal of the current status of state authorization and oversight of the programs, especially as these provide institutions with eligibility to participate in them.

The basis for recommendations made by the group was that proprietary schools be more closely integrated into the postsecondary education system to maximize choices for students and to use state expenditures more efficiently. The group's 14 specific recommendations are characterized by four stated needs: (1) to recognize the legitimacy of proprietary schools in higher education; (2) to maintain flexibility and responsiveness, the greatest strength of the proprietary sector; (3) to protect the autonomy of these schools; and  (4) to insure equitable treatment of proprietary school students. Specific suggestions for the proprietary sector involve representation on the Commission for Higher Education, participation in program planning and coordination, a representative organization, contracts for student spaces, student financial assistance, an information system, provisions for degree-granting authority and for information dissemination, and creation of a master plan for the state. Pertinent public laws and organization bylaws are included in the appendices. (Author/MSE)",

Regulatory legislation has been influenced by concern to protect citizens against submarginal and fraudulent operations; to protect the integrity of legitimate institutions; development of statewide planning, coordinating and governing boards of public higher education; the question of institutional eligibility of federal funding; increased awareness within the  states of the problems growing out of student unrest, and the impact of nontraditional forms of education; the movement for consumer protection in postsecondary education; and the redefinition of the role of states brought about by the Education Amendments of 1972.

This presentation has two stated purposes: (1) to demonstrate that the success of current proposals for lifelong learning will be highly dependent on their integration with the institutions and human activities concerned with work and leisure; and (2) to outline and demonstrate a belief that progress is combating a wide range of interrelated social problems such as unemployment, over and under education, worker alienation, poverty, racism, sexism, forced retirement and institutional obsolescence will require integrated policies and programs and that the redistribution of education, work, and leisure  throughout entire lifetimes may represent an effective means of addressing many of these social ills. The paper deals with four basic areas: (1) a general framework for social analysis based on overall lifetime patterns; (2) a review of problems in the realm of work and their relation to current lifetime patterns; (3) some speculations concerning the future redistribution of education, work, and leisure throughout entire life spans; and (4) a discussion of some of the research and policy implications of the analysis.

        "description":"The purpose of the study was to examine existing information on the level of quality of medical care delivered by foreign medical graduates (FMGs), as part of a broader consideration of policies relating to FMGs and health care delivery in the United States. Quality of care is considered to comprise both technical care and the &quot;art of care.&quot; FMGs do differ from U.S. medical graduates (USMGs) with respect to structural characteristics: (1) FMGs are younger than USMGs; (2) they have a longer undergraduate education (with less clinical experience and less favorable faculty-student ratio, generally); (3) as a group, they are less successful on the usual screening (ECFMG), licensure (FLEX), and specialty board certification examinations than are USMGs as a group: and (4) a high  proportion of FMGs had some or all of their medical education in English, but problems with English as a second language persist. A number of basic similarities between FMGs and USMGs exist: (1) they train and practice in specialties to the same degree; and (2) although FMGs are found to a much higher degree than USMGs in training programs that are unaffiliated with medical schools, an ever-increasing proportion take their training in affiliated programs. Two studies using process measures to assess the quality of care delivered by USMGs and FMGs were inconclusive. Lack of concrete evidence made formulating policy recommendations difficult. However, four areas of future research or evaluation are proposed: comparative studies, education of the less able practitioner, quality assurance and  peer review, and characteristics of the FMG physician pool.

The conceptual differences in French university education (as compared to American higher education) are keyed to the adjustments in the accounting method. French universities, rather than being competitive and relatively wealthy, are part of a strongly centralized national system; they therefore have less control over some variables. The social orientation of higher education is of less immediate importance than eliminating waste to increase effectiveness, and persuasive program budgets for resource allocation at the national level. The accounting systems, cost components considered, choice of direct or indirect cost allocation,  and calculation of unit costs and use of results are compared for the original and modified accounting methods.

Four trends emerged: (1) planning staffs and data processing were established in a number of universities; (2) a number of states have included university planning in their legislation and established long-range planning schemes; (3) a statutory framework has been established for university planning at the federal and state levels; and (4) cooperative planning is provided at the institutional, state, and federal  levels.

Since the group's needs and organizational structures were different from those addressed by most foreign studies, and lack of information was a significant problem, the French universities decided to concentrate on calculating costs of their final outputs:  instruction and research. The costs considered were: personnel, capital, operating, and student aid costs. Several kinds of budgetary control and the application of a simulation model are recommended for management of French universities. (MSE)",

This information was analyzed and organized to determine what impact the commission would have on FTU. Florida's existing State Planning Council for Post High School Education was designated to fulfill the intent of the law, which was to bring about statewide planning and coordination of programs among postsecondary institutions in the public and private sectors. This agency then became the 1202 Commission.  The commission was funded in 1974 by the U.S. Office of Education. In reorganization, some of the original agency members remained in the commission and additional postsecondary areas were represented. At the time of the study, the impact on FTU had been negligible.

        "description":"While some attrition is normal, it has been high at the Federal service academies in recent years. The rates, although down from their peak levels, are still above normal at several academies. Those who drop out, while scoring slightly lower on some tests than those who stay, are still of high quality, and GAO believes some would make good military officers. Attrition also results in inefficient use of existing facilities and increases the cost of educating an academy graduate. Most students leave voluntarily, although 20 percent are separated by the academy, principally for academic reasons. An important factor in attrition is the student's low level of commitment. Another appears to be a basic incompatibility with the military environment. Attrition during the first few months  is also related to what students perceive as an overemphasis on memorizing &quot;professional and nonprofessional knowledge.&quot; Student perceptions of some aspects of the academic program are also associated with some attrition during the first and second years. There is evidence that some entering students are not aware of the limited academic majors available, and the technical emphasis of the curriculum. Identification with a particular military group is important in reducing attrition. Third-class (sophomore) attrition is apparently related to conflict between individual needs for growth and the institution's need for stability. (Editor/MSE)",

Statistical analyses are used throughout the study, and a dropout profile is constructed. The federal service dropout: (1) scored above the national average on standardized academic measures; (2) had high school achievement lower than the persisting student; (3) ranked considerably below persisting students in Military Order of Merit; (4) was athletically inclined but showed less aptitude on athletic tests; (5) did not differ  significantly from persisting students in nonathletic activities; (6) characterized his political and social attitudes as liberal more often than his persisting counterparts; and (7) was from a middle income home with well-educated, professional parents.

It is necessary for advocates of new programs to deal with the basic assumptions underlying higher education in America. Faculty governance, the determination of what constitutes worthwhile knowledge, the selection of some subject matters and the rejection of others, the process of learning through life experiences, the definition of which experts can make these decisions, and other critical issues are examined. The 11 issues raised are a guide for proponents of external degrees to construct a rationale for their advocacy. The issues may also be used as a set of criteria for those who question external degrees to raise the critical concerns. The answers developed in response to the issues raised in  this paper should be a useful basis for faculty, administrators, governing boards, and citizens to decide the values and limitations of external degrees.

Some alternative theories are reviewed and corresponding advantages of the decision-making view are introduced. Decision theory contributions to our understanding of models of reality, conflict, and coalitions are discussed. The relationship between the business firm and the university is also considered along with some suggestions for practitioners that derive from the decision-making perspective. (Author/LBH)",

These models have serious shortcomings, both as reflections of reality and as prescriptions for change by leadership. Institutional researchers can play a significant role in the management of planned  change if they avoid functioning under many of the present management myths and illusions. Colleges and universities are characterized by hazy goals, an unclear technology, and fluid participation, which make them more difficult to describe, understand, and function in. (Author/MSE)",

The central question is Does higher education, to the extent that it acts as a filter, create new information about the abilities of students, or does it utilize known information to sort students according to their abilities? The creation of new information is termed the testing function of higher education and the sorting of students, the sorting function. The higher education system described by Arrow, in explaining the filter concept, does not create new information, it only performs the sorting function. The testing function is now defined and its relationship to the sorting function considered. (Author/MSE)",

Four concepts characterize the structure of American higher education: diversity, equalitarianism, local control, and mixed state and private enterprise; some of these qualities are uniquely American, and some may be used as models for higher education in other nations. Policy-making in American higher education has three central tendencies: (1) participation of several distinct groups (lay trustees, professoriate, students, and alumni) in governance; (2) the diversified membership of boards of trustees, as compared with the historical clergy board; and (3) the influence of teachers in defining  teaching and research policy. There are six central concepts in the operational control of American higher education: (1) administration as an ordered plan for performing the organization's work; (2) a stabled organization is required; (3) authority and lines of authority must be established; (4) authority involves willing cooperation; (5) an administrator must be an able and persuasive communicator of ideas and sentiments; and (6) able and persuasive communication is the primary factor in good administration.

Students perceive the courses as rigorous, and report an increased awareness of sex roles and the situation of women in society as a result of taking the courses.

At the time of consolidation into a single system, a unique, computer-assisted, admissions planning, counseling, and processing was established. A set of 13 philosophical and administrative guidelines was used in developing the system. Special problems arose in the process of implementing it: autonomy, racial issues, and lack of experience were significant among them. (Author/MSE)",

The initial sources of positive economic impact are the local purchases by the university, the payroll spending of its faculty and staff, and spending by students drawn to the local area by the university. This study used techniques developed in similar inquiries at other postsecondary educational institutions. Since the initial expenditures generate additional income in the local area, the university's total economic impact is some multiple of the direct expenditures. This study also examines several techniques commonly used to calculate this local multiplier. The study complements the American Council on Education's guide, &quot;Estimating the Impact of a College or University  on the Local Economy&quot; (1971). Whereas the guidebook focuses on estimating the university's initial spending impact, this study is a handbook for the actual calculation of specific multiplier values for the local community under investigation.

        "description":"Continuing education for professionals (CEP) may be defined as the formal or informal training an individual professional undertakes after the end of his basic professional education. Despite the implicit relationship between professionalism and CEP, continuing education has long been a tangential concern in the study of professional education. As it is, CEP is a complex phenomenon with different forms of organization, varying methods of delivering instruction, and numerous methods for acquiring financial support. Many professions have shown an interest in improving CEP, and there is some awareness that the original professional education will have to be planned with continuing education in mind. New recognition of the need for CEP to serve several purposes (changing licensure  regulations, technological advances, and changing personal goals as well as professionalism) is apparent in such fields as psychology and engineering, and its importance is recognized in medicine as well. Programs underway suggest that future CEP efforts will focus on techniques by which individuals can assess needs and prescribe learning activities by evaluation of their own practice. Also in the wings is more debate over the question of legally mandated CEP. (An extensive bibliography is included.) (Author/MSE)",

First, the evolution of federal influence on higher education since 1936 is reviewed, with a detailed discussion of regulations in effect since 1970 (including affirmative action, student financial aid, institutional aid programs, the Buckley Amendment, and categorical aid). There is discussion of how regulations are written, federal accountability versus institutional autonomy, recommendations for reform, costs to  institutions, resultant program changes, and the implication of federal regulations for higher education administration in the future.

If UW-Oshkosh had admitted students only in the top half of their classes between 1960 and 1975, Wisconsin would have lost over 780 college graduates, 245 of whom would have later earned graduate degrees. Most of them would not have been able to occupy the positions they now have or may have in the future, because they require college degrees. These  projections are conservative, since they are based on the 1960 class size, while class sizes have increased. A more restricted admissions policy could have a significant impact on the economic and social development of the state. (Author/MSE)",

Information on practitioner needs, on the use of descriptors and abstracting procedures, and on alternatives for improving the system was gathered and circulated to NIE staff members. The resulting document described three alternative ways of improving access to practitioner oriented documents and presented draft guidelines for writing abstracts. The alternatives were: revising the method of descriptor assignment to produce documents; revising and expanding pubtype codes; and creating a separate system for all products, programs, and practice documents. This document was then sent out to all clearinghouse directors, directors of ERIC search services, and others with a  request for comments. The responses were summarized, sample abstracts were developed and six recommendations were made: (1) pubtype codes should be refined, pilot tested, and refined again; (2) inter-clearinghouse inconsistency in indexing and abstracting should be reduced; (3) guidelines for abstracting product information should be agreed upon and entered into the Thesaurus; (4) successful computer search strategies for retrieving product documents should be available to all; (5) existing product information systems should be considered for coordination with ERIC.

Disconfirmed hypotheses included the importance of the content decided about, the importance in itself of accurate knowledge of the television industry, the type of real/pretend decisions children make, and the adjudged accuracy of children's decisions.

Games are suggested as a method to be used by parents and children, and the TV industry is asked to provide more examples of how programs are produced as well as more explicit labeling for programs based on true incidents.

        "description":"In this age of accountability, accreditation commissions face criticism from higher education professions and the public. Although agencies have committed their energies to protect the general public from inferior educational institutions, they appear to be insensitive to the effects of changes in education. There is a need to rank schools of higher education; and, since institutional programs are reflected by the support of their academic libraries, the lack of uniformity in library evaluation theory and practice is a critical problem. Accrediting agencies must define acceptable levels of library services and resources to become more accountable to the public. Selected results of a survey of Southeastern Library Association members on library evaluation are mentioned.  (Author/KP)",

Initially, early attempts to apply computer techniques to educational documentation and information were not coordinated between European countries. Interest in the American ERIC system resulted in two studies. The first study (1970) concerned the problems of using a common thesaurus of descriptors and a common format. The second study (1971) designed a proposed system. In 1974, the multilingual EUDISED Thesaurus was published and field experiments began to test the proposed system. In the primary experiment twelve national agencies completed a common worksheet on selected R &amp; D projects in their countries, and the results were published  in the EUDISED R &amp; D Bulletin. This and other experiments led to increased standardization between countries regarding indexing, abstracting, and dissemination. Present concerns are for the maintenance of a self-sustaining system; the expansion of computer access to all agencies; and the access to ERIC material and data from various international organizations.

In the course of the project, it was determined that existing organizations were capable of providing operational support for networking, but that no group other than the Western Council was in a position to coordinate state and multistate research, analysis, plans, policies, and continuing education for library resource sharing. The WICHE library program  was therefore renamed the Western Interstate Library Coordinating Organization (WILCO) and was redirected to offer a forum for investigating regional library concerns, to catalyze and facilitate interstate resource sharing, and to coordinate regional interests with national library network planning. This report concentrates on the most significant events of the year-long project. (Author)",

        "description":"Rich visual stimuli provided by the television medium may affect youngsters' cognitive processes and strategies in academic performance. Previous studies have revealed that television viewing enhances their achievement test scores through grade four, but scores decline after grade four. This paper suggests that visuals used in instructional context are not comparable in quality to those presented in television. In addition, curriculum beyond grade four level emphasized verbal content, and some youngsters find it difficult to shift the cognitive process from random scan in the visual mode to sequential and linear scan in the verbal mode. Inadequate reading ability and comprehension of verbal materials further affect performance in other academic areas. It is suggested that  systematic training may solve this difficulty; however, empirical research evidence is needed in order to determine the various factors accounting for the score decline. (SC)",

The results of the program are encouraging, and there is evidence that students felt that their teachers cared about their progress in a personal and individual way. (WBC)",

        "description":"In an attempt to overcome the lack of natural means of communication between student and computer, this thesis addresses the problem of developing a system which can understand natural language within an educational problem-solving environment. The nature of the environment imposes efficiency, habitability, self-teachability, and awareness of ambiguity upon such a system. The major leverage points that allow these requirements to be met are limited domain, limited activities within that domain, and known conceptualization of the domain. Semantic grammar is introduced as a paradigm for organizing the knowledge required to understand and permit efficient phrasing. The need for succinct formalism for expressing semantic grammars led to the use of the Augmented Transition Networks  (ATN). This led to the design and implementation of a general ATN compiling system which in turn translates an ATN into a program in a runnable computer language (LISP). The ATN compiler is also capable of producing programs which have been optimized to the features used by a particular ATN.

The course was developed according to thirteen cognitive and affective principles, and was used over a period of three years to train approximately 100 authors. This report contains a statement of the principles and a description of their implementation, including many examples from course materials. It also recounts the highlights and turning points of the author training course, reviews the basis for its modification, and examines the dilemmas encountered in teaching new authors to prepare computer-based instruction materials. Techniques for resolving some of these dilemmas are suggested. Also included  is the course feedback from outside groups. This report is directed to instructors of new authors, developers of author training materials, and managers of computer-based instruction development centers. (Author/SC)",

These devices, when attached to a PLATO IV terminal, serve to expand the types of input and output which can be managed by the terminal. For each peripheral device, the report documents the operating characteristics and their adequacy, the efforts and skills required to use the device, and alternatives which were considered. Also included are managerial considerations and some brief comparative data. As an evaluation report designed to aid decision makers, it contains no instructions detailing how to acquire, maintain, or operate these devices. It concludes that the touch panel is generally  reliable, the slide selector is adequate but good microfiche are hard to produce, and that early audio devices are barely satisfactory. It is noted that on-site testing and maintenance are needed for reliable performance and that authors wasted time and money trying to take shortcuts. (Author/SC)",

        "description":"Initiating an individualized approach to instruction must begin with an assessment of the needs and goals of the teachers. To provide this analysis, a diagnostic system was built, consisting of an inventory of teaching and learning needs and of procedures for implementing a learning plan based on this inventory. A one hundred and four item inventory was constructed in six sections: professional development needs, attitudes toward education, background in instructional theory and design, an evaluation of a course taught, the use made of diverse methods of evaluating instruction, and an analysis of instructional problems. The inventory was presented to forty college professors who were told that its purpose was to examine their needs as teachers so that they would be able to  determine their personal learning plans in their course. First analyses determined what each personal learning plan would be and acted as a contract between the teacher and the coordinator of the course. Inventory data was computerized as was data gathered from each participant throughout the course in regard to both the learning plan and the utility of the inventory. Results indicate that those teachers who are already motivated, self-directing, and have a specific problem which they wish to solve will put more effort into their work and will take better advantage of the resources provided. The need for further refinements of instruments and related questions for research are indicated. (DAG)",

However, teacher responses included: the names of the most used instructional materials by commercial name and by academic areas, their source of information for these materials, and the frequency of personal use of the Alabama Learning Resource Center. University chairmen responses included: the adequacy of methods courses to acquaint students with commercial aids,  the geographic inaccessibility of learning centers for most students, and the frequent use of the Alabama Learning Resource Center as a major source of audiovisual aids. Coordinators of special education responses included: the need for learning center availability, the adequacy of instructional materials within a center, and the suggested percentage of budget that should be allocated to certain instructional materials. It was included that more services need to be offered to teachers, including equipment and materials training. It was also suggested that funding priorities be divided away from a centralized learning center and toward increasing accessibility to materials. (DAG)",

        "author":["Dei Rossi, James A."],
        "description":"This paper examines the cost-benefit implications of alternative pricing and capacity investment decisions for automated scientific and technical information retrieval systems. Two typical systems are examined and numerical examples presented. In the first system, search requests are entered on-site. The show how setting price to maximize net social benefit precludes total cost recovery and implies subsidization. In the second hypothetical system, search requests are entered from remote access terminals. Allowance is made for random arrival rates, and distinction is made between system charges to users and other user incurred costs. With these refinements, the numerical examples show how, for certain ranges of output, total cost recovery is consistent with the maximization of net  social benefit. The paper then examines the \"public good\" attributes of scientific and technical information retrieval systems and concludes that such systems can be viewed as \"semi-public goods,\" since the information stored has the characteristics of a public good while access to this information has the characteristic of a private good. Based on the public good considerations and the numerical examples, the paper concludes that subsidization for the fixed costs is warranted to the extent that all reasonable alternatives which maximize net social benefit preclude total cost recovery.

The unit consists of five booklets covering the rudiments of computer hardware, computer programing languages, the different roles the computer may play in instruction, how the computer is used in different curriculum areas, and how to select an instructional computer application that is appropriate to one's needs. The field test population consisted of teachers both inexperienced and experienced in computer use. Evaluation focused upon the attainment of educational objectives, the potential of competitive educational methods, and on important side effects from the use of the materials. The data indicated  that the objectives were obtained and, unexpectedly, even the experienced group benefited. Competitive instruction through a seminar was judged not significantly different from booklet use, though booklets are thought to be independently usable. Side effects (unexpected outcomes) were numerous: notably, increased interest in computer use, in the demand for computer access, in the need to develop a communication network about computers and in an awareness of computer information resources. The objectives of each booklet and the questionnaires used are presented in appendices. (DAG)",

Trenton State College offers such a program but lacks a formal policy manual outlining the necessary requirements and procedures. This study surveyed the current policies in the Department of Media Communication Science at Trenton State College, policies existing in other institutions with similar programs in the state, policies of cooperating school districts, and the new state certification laws. This resulted in the development of two policy manuals; one to assist the coordinator of the internship program in planning and implementation and one outlining procedures and competencies for the student intern.

This process includes information gathering, its conversion to learning packages, its revision, and its formal publication. The purpose of this literature search was to identify and analyze authoring tools and procedures, and to identify information clearinghouses and data banks for instructional materials. Computer searches were made of data banks in the Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC), the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation libraries. Manual searches were made at several local libraries, and personal communication was  made with over seventy individuals and associations in the field of instructional technology. Over five thousand documents were evaluated and fourteen hundred of these were selected for eventual inclusion in a computer-based information storage and retrieval system described in Volume 2. Findings of the study are: (1) more applied but unevaluated documents are from the civilian environment, (2) equal numbers of applied and evaluated documents exist in both the civilian and military environments, (3) more authoring aids tend to be from the civilian environment, and (4) more procedures are available than are either tools or methodologies. Approximately sixty authoring tools and procedures are arranged by ISD phase and step in an extensive, annotated bibilography. (DAG)",

The television advertisement and its potential adverse effect on children have come to the attention of federal regulatory bodies, as well as consumer and children advocacy groups. However, there is a lack of evaluation of effectiveness of present and alternative regulatory stipulations. It is in the nonregulatory sphere that social and behavioral science has a major influence. It could guide decisionmaking in the television industry regarding self-regulation, and improve its service to the public. One such example is the family viewing code accepted by the industry, which has curtailed the amount of  violence and sex in prime-time programs. It is suggested that empirical evidence generated from social and behavioral science research could further influence industry action, and validate the rulings made by the broadcast standards departments, thus enhancing the public welfare.

        "description":"As a solution to the problem of disseminating information from research and development projects into the field, this project examined a number of diffusion models, developed the Omnibus Model, and tested it. The Omnibus Model consists of eight different action blocks. First, information is acquired both selectively and non-selectively, and then stored. A decision block examines the information about innovations and decides whether it is relevant to present or future needs. If that decision is positive, the information continues to flow through the system to the Communication Committee who channels it to the field via projects, local educational agencies, or the Bureau of Vocational Education. This block serves also as a gatekeeper for asking whether it is a good innovation,  whether there is financial support for its diffusion, and whether there might be other more appropriate channels for its diffusion. After dissemination comes resource utilization, the provision of alternate courses to aid implementation; and then comes execution of the program by the client. Transformations in the program are monitored, and feed-back from the field provides further information which can be entered into the system via the acquisition block. This report contains an analysis of the activities of the diffusion program during the first year, is supported by flowcharts, sample forms, and sample publications. (WBC)",

Thirteen community colleges were surveyed in order to obtain data on full-time, part-time, and male/female enrollment of Indian students and total student body, tribes represented, average age of Indian students, courses most often pursued by Indian students, percentage of Indian students who complete programs, percentage of Indian students going on to four-year colleges, return rate to original communities, and special services available to Indian students. Twelve colleges responded to the survey; their responses ranged from very good to inadequate in terms of their ability to provide the requested information. In many categories,  the information was unknown. The percentage of American Indians enrolled in each of the community colleges was also compared to the percentage of the American Indian population of the county served by each college. Results indicated that there was a wide range in community colleges' effectiveness in serving American Indians. Suggestions were offered to improve the efficacy of the community colleges in responding to Indian student needs. Limitations of the data used are noted in the report. A bibliography is appended.

Summary data by institution and totals and weighted means for types of institutions are provided on building efficiency (net assignable square feet compared to gross square feet), average weekly usage for classrooms and laboratories, distribution of space by type of room, and net assignable square footage per on-campus FTE (full-time equivalent) student. The data show that college buildings within the public community college system had a relatively high ratio of usable space to gross space when compared to other types of institutions. Although the public community  colleges did not rank first among other institutions on measures of day utilization, when evening utilization rates were combined with day utilization rates the public community colleges ranked first in average weekly room hours of utilization for classrooms (30.5 hours) and laboratories (26.9 hours), and student station utilization rate for classrooms (27.1%) and laboratories (23.8%). Analysis of net assignable square feet (NASF) shows that the community colleges had 11.0 NASF for classroom space and 17.3 NASF for laboratory space per on-campus student FTE. (JDS)",

This figure compares to the FY 1977 budget appropriation of $108,802,000, although $117,111,500 had been recommended by the Illinois Community College Board. It is noted that in the three-year period of FY 1974-1977, state credit-hour grant support per student has decreased more than 8% while inflation has increased by nearly 25%. Consequently, the bulk of the recommended increase over the 1977 budget is for credit-hour grants, with a rate of $20.80 recommended as the  base rate for the average credit-hour grant. This budget recommendation is intended to prevent further program closures, tuition increases, and deterioration of educational quality. Tabular and graphic data are included throughout and provide information on: state appropriations by budget item and apportionment rates FY 1966-1977; anticipated revenues by source and per credit hour for FY 1978; unit costs by college and instructional program area for FY 1976; annual apportionment FTE enrollment by funding category for FY 1976; assessed valuations and estimated tax collection losses; and equalization funding. Overall, costs for operation of the Illinois community colleges for FY 1978 are projected at $299,675,000 for 185,500 FTE students at $53.85 per credit hour. (JDS)",

This study was designed to isolate and analyze the remedial aspects of the program's social structure and functions. Participant observation data were collected over a three-semester period, focusing on instructional methods and content, motivating devices and failure management techniques, counseling  patterns, discipline management, and interface between the Middle College and the college. Interviews were also conducted with staff and samples of students. The data indicated that the strongest component of the program was its small size and that the college environment facilitated student motivation, but that the counseling component fell somewhat short of its potential due to teacher/counselor uncertainty over non-traditional role expectations. The overall impact of basic skills instruction was found to rank behind that of size, setting, and counseling. (JDS)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to examine the effects of a one-hour credit community services laboratory attached to a three-hour credit social sciences course on community college student participants in terms of alienation, perceived student role, and course satisfaction. The community services laboratory consisted of an outside project engaging the student in direct contact with consumer agencies, groups, or individuals. One hundred students participated in the study and were measured for pretest/posttest changes in scores on an alienation instrument and two measures of perceived student role. Additionally, comparisons were made to determine whether course satisfaction was greater for students in course sections with and without a community service laboratory. Results of the study  indicated that participation in a community service-oriented curriculum was far more satisfying for community college students than participation in a traditional curriculum arrangement. It was found that while the community service-oriented curriculum did not reduce student alienation, it was equal to the traditional method in changing perceived student role. Overall, the study revealed that the innovative community service-oriented curriculum was both relevant and worthwhile for meeting student and community service needs. Tabular data are presented throughout the report and an extensive bibliography and study-related materials are appended. (JDS)",

Findings revealed that: (1) administrators would like an organized, on-going program of professional development that would include a variety of topics and training formats allowing for individual differences in experiences, skills, and interests; (2) administrators expressed uncertainty about what their management development needs really were since some were unclear about their role responsibilities while others indicated there was no system  for evaluating their management performance; (3) administrators indicated a strong interest in developing their management skills through small group sessions, workshops, and opportunities such as internships that could be undertaken individually; and (4) the highest interest was in leadership and management/administration while the lowest interest was in human resources development. Several specific recommendations were made for the development of a systematic, flexible development program. Tabular data are included throughout the report.

During 1975-76, the project served 150 college students and 77 individuals from the community, all of whom had some form of learning disability. Primary problems experienced by the learning disabled students were deficiences in reading, writing, and spelling. Project services delivered to these students included routine diagnostic services, individual and group tutoring, instructor intervention, program guidance, job placement, and behavior management. Cost of  these services was less than $150 per student. Some improvement in the grade point averages of project students was seen, but wide variation in course completion rates between participants and non-participants were found for some academic disciplines. Recommendations for the design and administration of programs for learning disabled students in higher education are presented based on project outcomes. (JDS)",

The basis of comparison used was the grades received by both groups of students in various introductory academic courses taken one semester after the remedial students had taken their required reading and/or writing course. The same survey was conducted the following year with the new class of incoming freshmen. In both years of the study, the academic performance of the  former remedial students with regard to the percentage of passing grades they received was very comparable to the percentage of passing grades received by the non-remedial students. The implications may be useful for evaluating programs given to underprepared students in two-year colleges. Extensive tabular data are appended. (Author/JDS)",

Three samples of faculty were surveyed in 1972, 1974, and 1976 using a measurement instrument based on the behavioral theories of Herzberg, and resultant data were analyzed to determine if any significant differences existed between the three sets of faculty responses. Significant differences were found on nine of the survey items. In all but one instance, decreases in the level of dissatisfaction of faculty were noted. Overall, faculty showed increased levels of job satisfaction relating to their supervisors, job responsibilities, and growth opportunities. While not  statistically significant, improvements were indicated in such areas as achievement, policy and administration, recognition, and working conditions. No increases in dissatisfaction in any of the areas measured by the survey instrument were found. It was concluded that implementation of the Management by Objectives and Results program was not achieved at the expense of faculty satisfaction. Tabular data are included in the report. (JDS)",

        "description":"This study used the Bayesian Theorem and cost/effectiveness analysis to measure the short and long range effectiveness and minimum costs of individualized instructional units constructed by educational development officers for use with low-income students at four North Carolina technical institutes designated as developing institutions. Students experiencing the individualized instructional units in the technical institutes responded to opinionnaires measuring their judgments of value of each instructional unit, and to questionnaires measuring the degree of behavioral objectives achieved per unit. A cost analysis procedure calculated the costs for each instructional unit. Student value judgments of each instructional unit formed the prior distribution of the Bayesian Theorem and  the degrees of behavioral objectives achieved per unit made up the sample distribution of the model. Variables combined in the joint probability distribution generated utility probabilities (value) for each unit, and costs per unit combined with the utility values for each unit formed expected opportunity loss values in utiles from the conditional worth matrix. Utility and expected opportunity loss values indicated those instructional units with maximal effectiveness as well as those requiring revision. This model is an inexpensive effective planning procedure which demonstrates accountability in a variety of educational programs and systems. (Author)",

Use of the model requires only two college committees, one composed of the directors of the instructional areas, the director of library services, and a representative of the student development office, and the other composed of the college president and his cabinet. The first committee establishes the basic planning document and the second  reviews the document and suggests revisions where appropriate. The management systems officer, not a member of either committee, is responsible for providing necessary data to both committees, converting information in the committees' plan into data for use in the program budget model, operating the program budget model, and serving as a consultant to the committees. This model is felt to reduce many of the shortcomings associated with the planning process while insuring maximum participation/representation of various college constituencies.

The Illinois community college system represents a locally controlled, state coordinated, shared funding approach while the Tennessee system represents a state controlled, governed, and financed system. The differences between these approaches stem in part from the historical, philosophical and legal elements characteristic of each system. Illinois has had a long history of community colleges as evidenced by its having the oldest extant community college in the nation, while, on the other hand, public community colleges in Tennessee are less than twelve years old. Overall, Tennessee lacks the educational and  philosophical maturity which characterizes the Illinois system.

Results of the survey indicated that, overall, job security, need for money, career indecisiveness, and program difficulties were the main barriers to enrollment at vocational-technical schools. Additionally, survey data indicated: (1) respondents had generally positive attitudes toward vocational-technical schools; (2) distance was a barrier to enrollment; (3) females experienced barriers to enrollment as a consequence of the limited number of programs which they perceived as  available to them; and (4) financial aid, scheduling, information, and transportation were identified as barriers to enrollment. Recommendations made to reduce enrollment barriers included implementing more flexible instructional schedules, increasing adult counseling, offering more evening courses, encouraging females to participate in non-traditional occupations, increasing efforts in the area of minority recruitment, better dissemination of financial aid information, broadening the base of program offerings, better articulation with high schools, and personalization of the enrollment process.

        "description":"This document contains a summary descriptive analysis of a sample of 19,716 students who took the ACT test (American College Testing Program) and were enrolled in the public community colleges of Illinois during the fall 1975 term. The sample of students represented 12% of the total freshman enrollment and 20% of the full-time freshman enrollment in the public community colleges. Data indicated: (1) the ACT composite score for Illinois public community college freshmen was 17.3 and their average high school grade point average (GPA) was 2.6; (2) the public college freshmen had lower ACT scores and GPA's when compared to all Illinois college-bound students and as compared to national norms; (3) 50% of the students indicated they planned to apply for financial assistance and 56%  anticipated working while in college; (4) 32% planned to obtain a two-year degree, 7% aspired to a less than two-year certificate, and 56% aspired to a bachelor's degree; (5) health and business and commerce professions were tied in popularity as the first vocational choice (18%) of the community college freshmen; and (6) &quot;field of study&quot; was cited by 47% of the students as the single most important factor in making their college choice, while 22% cited tuition cost as the most important factor. Sixteen tables of data presented throughout the report reflect analyses of selected student characteristics. (JDS)",

The evaluation section requested a rating of importance of 11 educational goals and 12 expectations, and a rating of the degree to which goals and expectations were fulfilled. A response rate of 65% was achieved. Analysis of the system-wide data showed: (1) 40% of the graduates were employed, 22% were enrolled in school and employed, and 9% were enrolled in school; (2) of those attending school, 48% were liberal arts majors, 65% were part-time students, and 63% were seeking bachelor's degrees; (3) of those employed, 71% were working full-time,  41% felt their course work was very relevant to their jobs while 32% felt their course work was somewhat relevant, and 36% felt that their present jobs were the type in which they would probably make their career; and (4) in terms of evaluating their college experience, 90% considered being educated for an occupation as very important, approximately 75% felt that their very important goals had been attained, and 79% considered having been able to choose from a large curriculum as being very important. Analyses of the survey data for each campus are included as are tabular data displaying survey responses. The survey instrument is appended. (JDS)",

        "description":"As part of a follow-up study of 1971 entrants to Suffolk County Community College, a questionnaire was sent to 717 former full- and part-time students matriculated in associate degree programs to determine whether the students' objectives in attending the college had been achieved. Of those surveyed, 370 responded. Analysis of data obtained from the survey revealed that only 4.5% of the respondents felt that they had achieved their objectives (which they were asked to state in their own words) while enrolled. However, nearly 90% expected to graduate. Notably, those who reported they had achieved their objectives were able to state them with precision, while those who reported they had not achieved their objectives were either unable to state their objectives or provided a  nebulous response. Of the students who did not feel they had attained their objectives, the majority cited financial and family reasons as being the cause of their failure to do so. Overall, the data showed that the college met the educational and employment needs of its student body and that the institution's goals were consistent with most student objectives. It was concluded that personal factors, principally those that were financial and familial, had the greatest influence on objective achievement by students. Tabular data are presented throughout the report. (JDS)",

In addition, all New Jersey county colleges were surveyed to determine the prevailing practice with regard to institutional commencement attendance policies. Of the full- and part-time students surveyed, 70% responded, and all of the county colleges responded. Survey findings showed that students favored adoption of a lenient commencement attendance policy, but the survey of the colleges showed no conclusive evidence of tendency toward one policy or another, required or voluntary. It was noted that regardless of the policies adopted by the various colleges,  approximately 85-90% of the candidates eligible for graduation could be expected to attend. It was suggested that Ocean County College adopt a policy that would require candidates to be present at the scheduled commencement ceremony but would allow for exemption by submission of written explanation to the Dean of Students.

The paper attempts to show that each approach has unique contributions to make to the education of the young child with special needs. The role of teacher is discussed as well as aspects of learning and development that are stressed in these approaches. Many features are held in common. All three are concerned with fostering cognitive, affective and psychomotor development, a positive self-concept, independence and self-motivation. Implications for teacher education are discussed and competencies needed by teachers in a merged program are listed. Appendices include sections on themes and assumptions underlying open education;  pedagogical characteristics of open education teachers at the primary level; goals of open, preschool and special education; play and young special needs children; competencies developed by the Massachusetts Early Education Council; competency areas for the generic special educator; and Child Development Associate (CDA) competencies.(MS)",

(2) Who is responsible for early childhood education? Discussed are parents and parent education, teachers and professional competencies and government responsibility. (3) How should child development services be delivered? Problems related to the coordination of child care services are discussed, and criteria for an ideal delivery system are identified. The question of the role of public school systems in delivering child care services is  raised. (4) How will the issues facing early education affect the goals and roles of American education?

The sample was originally selected for another study (the St. Louis Baby Study) giving only secondary consideration to social factors. It includes a large number of lower-class black families and is not considered to be representative of the general American urban population. Data were collected from the mother, as general family informant and personal respondent, and from the child. Data on child and family cover the period from birth through the first year of school. Child characteristics include physical characteristics, scores on developmental measures, and scores on the Peabody  Picture Vocabulary Test. Family factors include: family income, parental authority and role, number of siblings and size of household, paternal stability, maternal employment and age, parental education, and housing. Changes in maternal attitudes are also examined. The report differentiates between social class (its primary concern) and social status, attempting to keep parental occupational level, education and source of income conceptually distinct. The bulk of the volume consists of charts, tables and other background materials.

Summary statistics are presented from responses to questions on: basic characteristics of households involved; type and extent of child care used; why and by whom; cost of care; consumer attitudes; and the role of the public. Analytical highlights emphasize the significance of child age, parent employment and marital status in the need for child care services, while also  dealing with the great variety of types of care, cost of care and government role.

There was evidence that children's sex role concepts were broader if their mothers were employed. The children's perceptions of their mothers were not related to the mother's employment status, but fathers were perceived more negatively by their sons if the mother was employed. Sons of employed mothers had lower IQ scores than either daughters of employed mothers or children with  nonemployed mothers. Children with employed mothers received better adjustment ratings from their teachers and were described somewhat more favorably by their parents. Parental data were obtained from 83 sets of parents. There were some significant associations between the children's and parents' measures. The parents' behavior and attitudes varied with the mother's employment status and the sex of the child.

        "description":"Investigating learning by imitation in infants and young children, this study addresses itself to the following issues: whether there is systematic accommodation, whether this imitation follows a universal sequence, how the development of an act over many trials relates to the development of indicators over many months, and what the phenomenon reveals about normal infant development in its social context. By meeting the gaze of the investigator, 34 infants elicited a rhythmic burst of 5 mouth movements, opening and closing. After many trials a majority of the infants themselves produced a burst of 2 or more such movements. Although no universal sequence of acts emerged from the data, a general form of accommodation was observed: (1) an orienting to the investigator, (2) a series  of imitation of single features of the model, beginning with mouth movement, and (3) a string of 2 or more features of the model, before (4) integrating the features into bursts of mouth opening and closing.

The program was designed to give high school and junior high school students an opportunity to work with preschool children through field experience in day care centers, coupled with a seminar for the planning of early childhood learning activities and the introduction of child development concepts. Demonstration projects were located in 14 public high schools, one privately funded alternative school and one public junior high school. Sites were selected to represent diverse geographical, socioeconomic, and ethno-cultural groups. The report describes program goals and concepts and the history of the demonstration projects over a 4-year period. Materials  developed for use in the program are discussed in detail and a synopsis of evaluative material is included. Report chapters deal with: establishment of demonstration sites; the project director's job and training; materials for students and for supervisors; field experience; the seminar; and program evaluation. Evaluations showed: (1) surprising stability in the impact of the program on students, teachers and institutions; (2) institutionalization of the program in all but two of the original sites; and (3) replication of the model in over 20 sites with only technical assistance and no external funding. Among striking student gains, the successful participation of special students with problem histories was seen as particularly significant. (Author/BF)",

The study also attempted to determine whether this internal achievement motivation behavior would be transferred by the children to situations such as learning in a classroom. The subjects were 122 male and 119 female elementary school children in grades two through six. The experiments involved children observing a peer model exhibiting high or low standards of self-reward in a novel game after which the subjects played the game, or subjects observing peer models choosing either difficult or easy goals in a novel athletic game after which the subjects played the same game, and, finally, subjects being given training in  self-monitoring and simple goal-setting. Substantial persistence of the effects of exposure to the models and generalization of these effects to a new game was demonstrated. Subjects who had seen a model prefer more difficult goals had, themselves, chosen more difficult goals. Exposure to self-monitoring training produced an interest in achievement, although the goal-setting procedures had no effect on either study behavior or achievement. The study suggests that even relatively brief systematic attempts to affect children's goal-setting and self-monitoring behavior have significant beneficial effects, and that investigation into the adaptation of such techniques to educational contexts seems highly worthy of further pursuit.(Author/MS)",

The conference was organized around three central questions: (1) what are the needs of Appalachian children for healthy development? (2) how do existing child development programs meet these needs? and (3) what do Appalachian programs need in order to improve their delivery of services? Conference recommendations include: emphasis on early intervention, with recognition of family context and cultural background; development of manpower, including administrative manpower; greater utilization of public information resources to obtain financial support; development of information and referral systems; improvement of communication  among programs and states; establishment of a network for legislative information; development of a data base on needs and services; and an increase in parent involvement. Included with the text are tables of data on health manpower, employment and per capita income for the region, as well as information on a variety of projects funded from several sources. Appendices include suggested fundraising and proposal writing procedures and a series of charts showing the distribution of health care personnel, nutrition services, and infant mortality rates in the Appalachian area.

The Differentiated Child Behavior Observational System which provides for systematic recording of group behavior in ongoing classroom activities, was applied in two days of observation in each of 17 classrooms (grades 1 to 3, ages 6 to 9). Two traditional (one middle-income and one low-income) and two nontraditional groups (one middle-income and one low-income) were compared. The nontraditional middle income classrooms were in private schools, the others in public schools. Significant differences were found in sheer amount of interaction, with significantly greater amounts in the two nontraditional groups. Although the general distribution of behavior among the  six major categories (Gives Information; Questions; Expresses; Acts Destructively; Organizes; Represents) showed similiar patterns, important qualitative differences were shown in finer-grained analysis of the 50 sub-categories. There were significantly more higher-level cognitive statements and questions by children in the Nontraditional groups. Expressive interactions, primarily limited to routine requests and complaints in the Traditional groups, represented a greater proportion of feelings and concern for others in the Nontraditional groups. The latter also had more autonomous and creative representational interactions and far less destructive behavior. Also reported are correlations with teacher behavior, reliability of DCB and intra-group differences. (Author/MS)",

Fewer were assigned to special education programs in general and EMR and TMR classes in particular. There were significant differences in favor of the longitudinal group performance on the MAT, SAL and CTBS  in second, third or fourth grade. There were no significant differences in teacher ratings.

Once experimental control had been demonstrated and the subject's noncompliance behaviors had been decreased to an acceptable level, separate analyses of the program components were initiated. Program components were: (1) consistent instructions, which involved making sure that the subject complied by reissuing the instruction so that the subject knew what was expected of him; (2) physical aid or \"put-thru,\" which involved actually aiding the subject to pick up blocks, move furniture or remain in a large group; (3) time-out, which was used as a back-up for noncompliance and required  the subject to sit on a chair for 60 seconds without getting off or tantrumming; and (4) teacher attention specifically praising the subject for compliance. Results indicated that the total package manipulation was most successful in decreasing all noncompliance behaviors. When contingent teacher attention alone was used, noncompliance behaviors increased gradually to above baseline rates. The condition combining consistent instructions, \"put-thru and contingent teacher attention yielded a considerably lower range of noncompliance behaviors. The condition combining contingent teacher attention with consistent instructions over time brought noncompliance to under 10% but proved less effective than the total 4-component manipulation.

The four subjects of this research ranged in age from 3 to 4 years and were a representative sample of the entire groups's attending behavior. The active play period took place outside where the children had access to playground equipment. Quiet indoor activities consisted of performing conceptual tasks, looking at books, or playing a game at a table. Observation of the children's attending behavior took place during large group. The observer used a 15-second scanning procedure and recorded  whether the subjects were attending while a story was being read or a movie shown. Attending was defined according to bodily position directed toward the designated stimuli; silence; response to teacher instructions; display of disruptive behavior, and closeness to the group. Results indicated that the children were less attentive in large group when a quiet activity preceded it than when an active activity preceded it. This study points up the fact that behavior can be altered by scheduling a preceding activity which will reduce the occasion for inappropriate behavior. (Author/MS)",

        "description":"This paper reviews three studies which illustrate the use of two different techniques of behavior modification to control aggression in preschool children in classroom situations. The first technique demonstrated the use of \"time-out\" as a mild punishment procedure. The teacher changed events following aggression by briefly removing the child from reinforcing experiences. This procedure was effective in reducing aggressive behaviors of two 4-year-old boys in two different studies, one conducted by Busby, Thomson and LeBlanc, and the other by Holmberg, Kastl, Hursh and Colley. In the former study, after attack behavior was decreased, this decrease was maintained when the time-out technique was cintingently applied to other behaviors. In the latter study, an increase in the  subject's peer interactions was shown when his aggressive behaviors were low. In a less direct approach, Pinkston, Reese, Baer, and LeBlanc used extinction and reinforcement to control aggression. Teachers ignored the 3 1/2-year-old subject's aggressive behavior and gave attention to the child who was the object of the aggression. Later, when the subject exhibited nonaggressive behavior, he received social reinforcement. Return to the no-treatment condition demonstrated the effect of the treatment procedure, in that the behavior increased each time there was a no-treatment procedure in effect. It is conjectured that if the subject acquired the necessary skills to interact with his peers, peer attention would become the reinforcer for nonaggressive behavior. (Author/BF)",

The material is used during the Infant-Toddler phase of the BEEP program. It is relevant to families with babies between birth and two years of age. During this period, services of the project are delivered to the parents and through them to their child. Most of the work is done in the family's home usually with the child and one or both parents present. In some cases the work is done in the BEEP Center. In others, where the child is under the care of someone other than his parents, visits may be made in the day care center or in the caretaker's home. Sections included in this Curriculum are: (1) The Beep Home  Visitor, (2) Themes of the Brookline Early Education Program, (3) Principles of Child Development and Related Parent Behaviors, (4) Curriculum Sequences for Physical, Social and Cognitive Development, (5) Questions to Structure Home Visits, (6) Questions and Issues Parents Have Raised,7) Potential Goals for Families, 8) Teacher Evaluation Interview, (9) References for the BEEP Education Program, (10) Forms for Recording Information.

Process analysis is contrasted with outcome-oriented evaluation, the latter seen as prevalent in current research practice. Four functions of process analysis are: to describe current teaching practices, to train teachers, to monitor instructional programs, and to investigate relationships between classroom activities and pupil growth. Systems for observing the process of teacher-child interaction are categorized as either open, low-inference systems or closed, high-inference systems. The specimen-description technique is cited as an example of the forner, while examples of closed systems are time-sampling, event-sampling and trait-rating. Methodological issues discussed relate to choice of  appropriate instruments, reliability of observers, and degree of researcher control over selection and supervision of the program to be evaluated.

Discussed are the philosophy and aims of current Chinese education, curriculum practices in the preschool, primary and middle school and in teacher training institutions, The Little Red Soldiers programs and the Children's Palaces. Educational practices are influenced greatly by Maoist ideology. Preschools stress group activities and most have few toys or other physical props in comparison with their American counterparts. Kindergarten curriculum stresses physical development, but some attention is given to art and rudimentary language skills. In primary school, academic instruction and the study of Maoist teachings are begun. In middle school, the curriculum becomes  specialized and much time is spent in factories or on communes where children are taught to respect manual labor. Primary and middle schools are very formal. At age 17 all men and women are assigned to work in a factory or on a farm for two years. Members of the neighborhood party make recommendations for further education. Individuals recommended for teacher education receive two years of training, with half of the last year spent in practical experience under a master teacher. A nationally sponsored program that emphasizes citizenship training, The Little Red Soldiers, is part of most children's training by the end of primary school. Each major city has a Children's Palace, which houses after school programs sponsored by The Little Red Soldiers. Children's attitudes and school behavior  are briefly discussed. (SB)",

        "description":"This study tests the hypothesis that optimum testing style will result in more efficient test performance by 4-year-olds, thus diminishing differences between scores of lower class children who have and have not attended enrichment programs. A review of the literature discusses the effects of testing situation variables, language differences, dialects, ethnicity, motivational factors, and manipulation of pretest conditions on the scores of low income children. In the present study, scores on the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Ability (ITPA) were compared, since it was assumed that language scores were particularly likely to reflect the effects of optimum testing style. Data included the ITPA scores of (1) children participating in the Family Development Research Program  (FDRP), an enrichment program for infants to school age children from low income families; (2) carefully matched control children who did not participate in the FDRP program but who were tested under FDRP conditions; and (3) children who had served as controls for other enrichment programs, in which testing was not done under FDRP conditions. Children in the FDRP experimental and control groups were not tested until they were at ease in the testing situation, with all attempts made to optimize test conditions. Although FDRP control children scored below children in the FDRP enrichment program, they performed only slightly below national norms on three of the ITPA subtests used in the comparison, and considerably above national norms on the other four subtests. Control children from the  other enrichment programs generally performed below national norms on all subtests for which comparable data were available. Results and implications for testing and intervention programs are discussed. (SB)",

Subjects were approximately 50 children, ages 3 to 6 years. Two-minute segments were selected from each of a series of tape-recorded sessions in which the child's preschool teacher or mother read him/her a story. Segments were transcribed and analyzed clinically and linguistically. Results indicated that: (1) there is a wide range of variation between readers and children while stories are being read; (2) children say more when they are familiar with the story, frequently reciting passages they have memorized and/or emitting more  statements or questions; (3) readers emit about the same number of statements and questions whether the story is familiar or unfamiliar; and (4) as stories are repeated there is continuous growth in child-reader interaction, occurring in both concept indentification and language skill. This study supports the speculations of other research regarding the importance of repetition in the language learning process. (SB)",

This study is part of a continuing process by the National Day Care Information Centre to obtain information concerning day care services and degree of unmet need, and to provide a basis for evaluating the impact of federal policies in the day care field. The National Day Care Information Centre gathered data as of March 31, 1976 regarding the growth experienced in day care centres offering full day care and those offering lunch and after school programs. The number of day care spaces increased from 69,952 in 1975 to 83,520 in 1976--a gain of 19.40%. This is substantially lower than the rate of increase in 1974 and somewhat lower than the rate of increase in 1975. These percentages remained relatively  unchanged from 1975: 18.38% of children aged 3-5, 4.30% of children under age 3, and .4% of children aged 6 to 15, all of working mothers, are enrolled in day care. The number of day care spaces under the auspices of parent cooperatives experienced a further decrease: from 1974 to 1975 by 12.78% and in 1976 by 41.99%. Centres under public, community, and commercial auspices experienced a modest increase. Observations suggest that the rate of growth in day care in 1977 will be significantly lower than in 1976.

The essence of the CDS Program is prevention, to identify and meet early developmental needs before the child is burdened by problems. The key to the program is the child development specialist who works as a member of the school district staff. The guide consists of two sections: planning the CDS program, and implementing it. The planning section considers basic issues: identifying the population to be served, developing statements of philosophy and objectives, staffing the  program, involving other agencies and organizations, and establishing a budget. The implementing section discusses staff orientation and training, assessment of student strengths and needs, selection and implementation of classroom activities, and involvement of parents and community. Each topic is illustrated by experiences of the pilot projects, details of which are summarized in appended tables. (Author/BF)",

During a 12-week period (30 minutes a day, four days a week) 96 3- to 9-year-old children were enrolled in a social perspective-taking training program at school. A control group of 96 subjects attended a regular school program. The training consisted of the following aspects: (1) helping children learn to recognize various feelings in themselves and others and to understand and predict what emotions might result from specific classroom events; (2) role-playing, (3) practice in concepts of perspective, (4) practice in play strategy. Before and after the training the subjects were tested individually on nine role-taking tasks. The 4- to 9-year-old children were  also tested in controlled situations on altruism and competition. Analysis of covariance with mental age and the pretest role-taking score as covariables revealed that, in comparison with the control group, the 6- and 7-year-old children in the experimental group increased their total role-taking ability significantly. For the 3-, 4-, 5- and 8-year-olds, there were significant differences only on some role-taking subtests. Chi-square tests on the posttest scores for altruism and competition did not reveal any main or interaction effects on both variables. However, there was a trend on the posttest for children in the experimental group to help more than children in the control group. (Author/MS)",

        "description":"The Sex Stereotype Measure II (SSM II), a 32-item picture-story technique, was developed to assess children's knowledge of conventional, adult-defined, sex-trait stereotypes. The procedure was based on stereotype characteristics identified by college students using the Adjective Check List item pool. A second procedure, the Sex Attitude Measure (SAM), was developed to assess general evaluative bias toward male and female persons. Both procedures were composed of brief stories presented with human figure silhouettes to preschool, third, and sixth grade Euro-American children. Both the male and female stereotypes were found to increase linearly with age, with more male traits than female traits being known to each age level. Item analyses revealed differences in the age at which  children become aware of various stereotype traits, with the learning of some traits still incomplete at age 12. Although there was generally good agreement between boys and girls, there were some apparent sex differences in acquisition of knowledge of certain items. The SAM scores indicated no age-related effects and at all three age levels girls were clearly pro-female and anti-male, while boys were unbiased toward females and only slightly anti-male. No consistent relationship was found between sex-stereotype knowledge and evaluative sex bias. It was concluded that the SSM II was a useful procedure for the study of the existence of sex stereotypes in a variety of populations and for investigations of the determinants of sex-trait stereotype learning.

        "description":"The effect of having a child serve as a rule-following model for other children on the model's own subsequent rule-following was investigated in a resistance to deviation situation. A total of 45 middle-class boys in grades 1 and 2 were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions following instruction not to touch a set of attractive but prohibited toys. In the model condition, boys performed as models of resistance to deviation before a TV camera for children at another school. In the no model condition, boys were told they would serve as models for others but, through a mechanical failure, were unable to do so. Control subjects were not told they were to be models. When alone with the prohibited toys, boys in the model condition touched less often and for less  time than did boys in the control condition. Boys in the no model condition did not touch significantly less than control subjects. Further, model boys touched less quickly than no model and control subjects. Finally, boys in the model condition spontaneously reproduced the idiosyncratic resistance behaviors they modeled more than boys in the other conditions who also practiced this behavior. Thus, having a child serve as a model of good behavior for other children appears to be an effective disciplinary technique that avoids some of the undesirable side effects associated with punishment, such as increases in the child's aggression, resentment and alienation.

A total of 108 infants, aged 18, 24, and 30 weeks, were habituated to (1) the same face in the same orientation, (2) the same face in differing orientations, or (3) different faces in different orientations. All subjects were then tested for generalization of habituation with a familiar face in a novel orientation and a novel face in a novel orientation. Results for both fixation times during post-habituation trials and dishabituation to the test stimuli indicated little conceptual categorization at 18 weeks, possibly the beginnings of such categorization at 24 weeks, and evidence for responding at two different categorical levels (both that of a&quot;specific face regardless of orientation&quot; and &quot;faces in general&quot;) at 30 weeks of age. These results suggest that concept acquisition ability may be present at a much younger age than had previously been believed. (Author/MS)",

Seventy-two children (12 boys and 12 girls each in kindergarten, second, and fourth grades) were shown pictures of simple events. In four response conditions, distractors differed from stimulus pictures in (1) who the participants were, (2) which participants were paired, (3) what type of action was occurring, and (4) each participant's role. There was a highly reliable effect of conditions on recognition accuracy, but no effect of age or interaction of age with condition. All children remembered the participants, role and type of action, in that order. They did not consistently remember which participants had been paired. It was inferred that: (1) children used semantic  information to organize these pictured events; (2) they seem to have had available in memory a set of participants, with information about role relation and action of each participant; (3) the ability to use role and action information for picture recognition apparently develops very early.

Subjects for the present study were 38 white middle-class mothers and their normal, 1-year-old infants (20 male, 18 female). Infants who were classified as to the quality of their attachment relation to their mothers at 12 months in the Strange Situation were seen nine months later in a free play session with their mothers. Results showed that infants judged more secure at 12 months had mothers who (when their infants were 21 months) were judged significantly more sensitive, more accepting, and were more expressive of positive affect than mothers of insecurely attached infants. Also, mothers of insecurely attached  infants showed significantly more anger than mothers of securely attached infants. It was found that differences in infants' apparent security at 12 months can be meaningfully related to differences in mothers' social and affective behavior nine months later. (Author/MS)",

The classrooms were not \"exemplary\"; The children had lower-middle-class origins. Each child was observed under free-choice conditions for approximately 80-90 minutes over a 3-month period. Two-minute narrative records were collected and later coded with regard to activity categories, social interactions, distractions. A battery of tests including subscales from the WISC, Matching Familiar Figures Test of cognitive style and items from Wallach and Kogan's associational fluency tasks were also given to each child. The various observational and test scores were correlated. WISC Vocabulary scores and MFF scores produced the major significant correlates  with activities. For instance, a pattern emerges in which children with higher vocabulary scores and reflective cognitive styles pursue more traditional academic tasks, particularly reading activities and also spend more of their time focused on activities without companions. The pattern of correlations regarding IQ is strikingly similar to that often found in traditional highly structured classrooms. Possible sources of these similarities, including the ecologies of the particular classes studied are explored. (Author/MS)",

Four perspective transformations of a sponge rubber object (rotation around the vertical axis, rotation around the horizontal axis, rotation in the frontal plane, and looming back and forth) were contrasted with a rubbery &quot;squeezing&quot; motion of the same object. Twenty-four infants were habituated to three of the perspective transformations and tested on a pre- and post-test with a fourth perspective transformation and with the deforming motion. The dependent variable was looking time. Backward habituation curves showed a rise in looking time when the post-test was introduced after  habituation, but a greater rise for the deformation than for the rigid transformation. Analysis of variance confirmed that the type of motion (rigid or deforming) was significant in determining degree of habituation. The inference was made that the infants perceived the invariant property of rigidity in all four perspective transformations and thus differentiated them from deformation. (Author/MS)",

It was further hypothesized that in mixed-age encounters, younger children would use cues associated with older children (i.e., physical size) as a basis for reward deservingness. Older children, however, would base their reward distribution on task performance. Children (48 first graders, 48 third graders) were shown a photo of two other children (&quot;players&quot;), and a photo of two stacks of building blocks each of the players supposedly built in a game. Children were asked to divide 10 prize chips between the two in the photo. Reward distribution was measured in a 2 (grade of child allocator) x 2 (relative size of the player) x 2  (mixed- or same-age group) x 3 (relative task performance) factorial design. Data corroborated the hypotheses. Third graders consistently divided rewards on the basis of task performance, ignoring age and size variables. First graders also allocated rewards on the basis of task performance, except when a player was both older and larger. Older, larger players received disproprotionally larger rewards than did same-age mates who had equivalent levels of task performance. (Author/MS)",

Subjects were 60 children, aged 3 to 5 years, from middle-class and lower-class families. The study was conducted in two phases, with the following objectives: (1) to identify and analyze aspects of cognitive functioning to be studied from classroom observation, and (2) to investigate developmental changes in symbolic play and assess cognitive functioning levels. A secondary aim of the latter phase was to compare the play of middle-class and lower-class children. Data were collected through written observer narratives. In Phase I observers described as many verbal and nonverbal behaviors (including interactions with others) as possible.  Analysis of the data resulted in the identification of three aspects of cognitive functioning for classroom observation of symbolic play: symbolic representation, involvement and language. These aspects were studied in Phase II. A guide for recording symbolic play and a manual of procedures for analysis of symbolic play were developed; both are included in the appendices. Investigation of developmental changes in group play found trends in 11 of 30 categories studied, some in each of the three cognitive areas. The symbolic play of middle-class children was found to be similar in quality to that of lower-class children. (Author/BF)",

Four observable physical measures were combined into a behavioral index of pain and tension: irregular breathing, tension of the upper extremities (rigid muscle flexion), vocalizations of pain (a cry, scream, or moan), and agitated body movement. A mean pain-tension index was computed for the time units in which each woman had a uterine contraction and for periods of rest between contractions. These measures were correlated with the woman's age, race, childbirth training, and a list of observable labor room events (medical procedures and social interactions). Subjects were recruited upon entering a large hospital to deliver. Thirteen  hours of data were collected. Results showed that age is inversely correlated with the pain index, older women expressing less pain than younger women, and white women expressing less pain than black women. Parental education and income levels were related to attitudes, expectations and anxieties of prospective parents during pregnancy. Training for childbirth through preparation classes was not significantly related to observable pain during labor, although it was found that women who were trained rarely showed great pain. Factors which might indicate physical difficulty of labor were considered in relation to the pain-tension index. Labor room events which significantly correlated with the pain-tension index were various verbal and behavioral interactions between father and mother.  (SB)",

Two hypotheses derived from Schneirla's Approach-Withdrawal Theory were examined: (1) that responses of the younger, but not of the older infants, would be directly related to stimulus intensity, with finger extension (approach) movements elicited by weak stimuli and flexion (withdrawal) movements elicited by more intense stimuli; and (2) that stimulus dimensions such as distance, size and brightness would make additive contributions to stimulus intensity, so that combinations of weak intensity would elicit finger extension and combinations of strong intensity would elicit flexion.  Subjects were shown a red cone that varied in size, brightness and distance from the infant. An analysis of variance indicated significant age, intensity and age x intensity effects. As expected, as intensity increased, the younger infants' responses showed a decreasing proportion of extension movements, while older infants' responses indicated no clear relationship between intensity and response direction. The finding that younger infants were responsive to the quantitative rather than the qualitative aspects of stimulation has important implications for understanding how various stimulus dimensions affect infant responses.

A total of 61 hospitalized children in three age groups (5, 7, and 9 years) were administered a number of tasks (designed to assess intellectual functioning, conservation, role taking skills, physical causality, and causality of illness). A significant age progression was observed, with these concepts,  involving a shift from global, undifferentiated to increasingly abstract principles.

        "description":"Characterized by limited financial resources, course offerings, vocational education programs, faculty, and administrators, rural schools have a student population that is generally poorer, less motivated, more culturally deprived, and more isolated than its urban counterpart. Consequently, the rural school teacher has an especially demanding job, which is considerably more complicated than that of the urban teacher. Results of a nationwide survey indicated that 75.4% of the teachers surveyed felt they were inadequately prepared to teach in rural schools. Some of the newer approaches to teacher training that seem particularly useful are: earlier teacher training experiences; micro-teaching; mediated learning aides; competency based teacher education; and teacher centers. Among  200 teacher training institutions in a nationwide survey, there were only 15 which had any rural education emphasis. However, the National Rural/Regional Education Association supports an active and growing group of university personnel interested in rural education, and there are rural education programs going on in Idaho, Utah, New York, and other places striving to meet rural needs via preservice and/or inservice course work.

        "description":"While the policy of rural school and district consolidation is not totally devoid of worth, its strengths were greatly exaggerated, its weaknesses simply ignored, and its overall merits as a strategy for educational reform grievously oversold. Despite the massive investments made on its behalf, consolidation has not dramatically alleviated the educational problems endemic to rural areas. In Vermont, the nation's most rural state, small high schools seem to be performing as well as their larger counterparts on the one available output measure, percentage of graduates. However, Coleman, Jencks, et al. maintain that consolidation is unlikely to affect either academic achievement or lifetime earnings, that it serves mainly to direct attention away from income redistribution and other  improvement efforts. There is not a single study among 14 recent consolidation studies controlling for IQ and socioeconomic effects, which records a consistant, positive correlation between size and achievement. Consolidation opponents have failed to argue diseconomy and have, rather, argued quality of life, etc. in defense of small schools. Asserted over and over again the economy argument was initially believed and then ultimately supported by researchers who were its advocates; since performance outcomes are hard to measure and harder yet to agree upon, the advocates ignored such outcomes as ability to relate well, and focused upon the more measurable outcomes (buildings, equipment, etc.).

Applications of broadband communications to rural areas were divided into public services (health, education, law enforcement, and governmental/administrative uses) and commercial uses (security systems, information and data transmission, and pay-TV). Each category was examined in terms of: rural needs; experiments conducted in providing the service; and potential rural uses, including their feasibility and value. In addition, tasks were undertaken to: identify rural needs and make a preliminary evaluation of actual and potential applications of broadband  communications to meet those needs; determine the present status of rural growth so that the role broadband communications might play could be defined; and identify constraints to, and an approach for, bringing broadband communications to rural areas. Three policy alternatives were identified, briefly considering pros and cons of each. Appendices include: an examination of the health services and needs of rural populations; and a description of the technologies (cable television, translators, telephone, microwave, communications satellite, fiber optics) included in the assessment and the economic factors governing their use.

In examining alternative technologies, questions of feasibility, efficiency and effectiveness should be addressed. Numerous experiments, demonstrations, random innovations, and research studies have explored the match between specific telecommunications technologies and the delivery of specific services. Some have produced information on the effects of using comprehensive telecommunications systems to deliver various services. Others have indicated that certain results cannot be generalized across localities. Implementation of a program to bring broadband communications to unserved and underserved rural areas should begin as soon as  possible. However, before deciding whether to begin large scale broadband system demonstrations in rural areas, two research tasks should be completed--the integration and analysis of existing knowledge and the development of a methodology for identifying the communications requirements of localities. The Office of Telecommunications Policy has initiated a two-year program to assess the adequacy of current mechanisms for Federal assistance to rural areas seeking to upgrade their telecommunications, and to develop, if necessary, a more effective and efficient Federal program for providing such assistance.

Especially promising are programs to reduce the cost of transportation and to extend services to dispersed rural populations, especially education, health, and entertainment services. There is a strong presumptive case that broadband communications can do a great deal to promote rural development. However, to be effective communications systems must be geared to the realities of rural conditions. As in other service areas, the communication systems have strong urban orientations which must be changed if these systems are to be useful for rural people. In addition to the need to gear development programs to the special realities of rural places, a rural development policy must be based on a number of other  considerations. Among these is the need for a national balanced growth and full employment strategy and a rural development policy that will moderate inflationary pressures and facilitate the achievement of full employment. This paper aims to establish the basis for a discussion of the usefulness of broadband communications for rural development by discussing some of the main characteristics and trends in rural development and outlining some of the public and private rural development mechanisms.

Thus, a marketing function of quite special character must be built into the research design. A professional who understands &quot;communications as a management function&quot; needs to be positioned on the project staff. This &quot;marketing director&quot; would be responsible, on site, for: (1) building awareness within the community of the  potential in broadband communications technology, presenting the array of potential services in such a way as to facilitate community choices; and (2) relating the plan to install the contemplated broadband communications system to the appropriate elements of a community development plan. The marketing function will be especially helpful in the collection of four kinds of data crucial to the research design: baseline opinion survey, an inventory of existing communications technology, a needs agenda, and the potential subscriber market.

        "description":"In enacting legislation that impacts on rural areas or is directly related to telecommunications, Congress has rarely considered the role of communications in rural development. Neither the House nor the Senate Agriculture Committees considered the role of telecommunications in drafting the 1972 Rural Development Act. While no specific provisions for telecommunications were included in the Act, the Farmers Home Administration approved a loan for a broadband communications system under Title I, Section 102 regarding Community Facility Loans. Although the needs addressed in the 1976 Educational Broadcasting Facilities and Telecommunications Act were not specifically rural, experiments in using satellite communications for educational purposes were conducted. The 1975 Regional  Development Act provided for demonstration projects in health, nutrition, and vocational and technical education. Yet, there was no explicit intention for telecommunications to be included in these projects. This lack of attention appears to be a matter of oversight rather than one of deliberate exclusion. While there have been numerous broadband communications experimental projects involving different rural areas, most have started with technology rather than program. Without a clear Congressional mandate, it is highly unlikely that a coordinated systematic approach will evolve using broadband communications technology to serve rural people. (Author/NQ)",

Growth and migration rates for metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas were compared. Counties were classified by certain basic functional characteristics, and the trend was examined in those that were dominated by some feature or function. Principal source of current population data was the annual series of estimates for all counties conducted by the Census Bureau in cooperation with State agencies. Causal data such as the Social Security Administration's statistics on covered employment and on location of retired worker beneficiaries were also used. Findings included: from April 1970 to July 1974, the nonmetropolitan counties increased in population by  5.6%, while metropolitan counties grew by 3.4%; as measured by the rate of net migration, all but two States showed increased net retention or greater acquisition of population in their nonmetro areas in the 1970's as compared with the 1960's; the nonmetro counties that showed the most rapid growth were those that were termed retirement counties; the second most rapidly growing class of nonmetro counties was those where a senior State college was located; and counties with high dependence on farming were still having net outmigration though on a far lower pace of outmovement than in the 1960's.

Statistics on growth in the seventies suggest three possibilities: a change in the functions of metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas; the decline of the city as the major cultural and economic focus; and the decline in the utility of the present statistical definitions and the continuing homogenization of America. What is probably happening is a mixture of all three possibilities. However, some of the major forces that will influence the American economy and demography for the next few decades need to be examined, since it is these that will shape not only how many people will live in the  rural areas, but also their relative well-being. These major forces include: the aging of the baby boom; continued decline in the birth rate and aging of the population; lower rates of job formation and economic growth; energy supply and cost; and the role of American agriculture in world food supply. Three inequalities can result: agriculture will not equal rural America; industrial development will not equal increased community well-being; or growth or increased well-being for rural America will not equal growth or increased well-being for the rural community.

The isolation of these communities comes out of a need for cohesiveness within a system that functions for them. There is some mutual support between their economic, political, and social system. The government needs to make exceptions, to give special considerations, to do for the poor in a way that fits their survival system. Therefore, a proper diagnosis of community is essential to proper formulation of policies and appropriation and further development of technology and content. Because communications is such a fundamental approach to human and societal growth, it is critical that citizens of a given area have access to  new technology and exert influence over the content and style projected through the medium. Innovative educational programs could develop out of rural communities with access to communication facilitating devices if cultural realities were used to influence form and content. Hence in the development of communications technology it is important to have the technical and financial competency to deliver the good to such communities so that they might use communications as the prime mover toward fulfilling their definition of development.

Analyses of projected capital and operating costs, anaticipated revenues, prospective public service applications, required non-entertainment contributions, and break-even fees and penetration rates were made using the Hopkins Cable Model modified to reflect some specific features of rural systems. The system was designed on the basis of the County's existing utility distribution system. The analytical approach was to: estimate, on the basis of model calculations, the total capital and operating costs of the system over a  10-year period; determine the amount of these costs that can be expected to be covered by subscriber revenues for entertainment uses over the period; and indicate the remaining average annual revenues that would be required to be covered from public service uses, grants, and other sources of non-entertainment revenue for the system to break even. Findings included: a demonstration system in the County would cost around $3,880,000; subscriber fees for entertainment uses were anticipated to yield $1,903,000 in total revenues over the period; and at a $6/month basic subscriber fee, a penetration rate of 74.5% would be necessary to finance the system entirely from entertainment uses.

        "description":"While state and local regulation is important to the development of communications, particularly broadband, Federal policies have been and will continue to be the dominant force in shaping the regulatory environment for communications. This paper identifies the Federal regulatory policies that have been most important to rural communications, and assesses broadly how well they have served to promote balanced national growth and development. In addition, areas where policy is and is not sufficiently flexible to meet distinctive rural needs are identified. Federal regulatory policies are organized within broad categories: (1) broadcasting (radio and television), (2) cable (general policies), (3) cable and broadcast translators, (4) telephone-telegraph services, and (5) domestic  satellites.

Although the extent of interest within the Federal government is wide, the intensity of interest is low, particularly at the highest levels. This paper provides: (1) a review of the specific interests and capacities of the various Federal agencies actually or potentially concerned with rural telecommunications; (2) an assessment of the specific roles that various Federal agencies and other interested parties might play in rural telecommunications; and (3) a description and appraisal of the merits of various scenarios by which different plays might be combined into a broad effort. Information is from several  interviews with Federal government officials and other interested individuals, along with a review of recent legislative initiatives. Among the Federal agencies discussed are the: Department of Agriculture; Appalachian Regional Commission; Office of Telecommunications Policy; Department of Commerce; and Health, Education, and Welfare.

        "description":"The following problems in the field of educational organization are examined in terms of a Peruvian case study: prerequisites for community participation in national planning; national planning which starts at the local level; integration of formal and nonformal education programs at the local level to meet the needs of the total local population; integration of educational programs with other social development and production programs; and the extent to which local and regional authorities can act on their own in the face of barriers at the central level. Illustrating the manner in which these problems might be addressed, Peru's educational plan is described as one based upon the Community Education Nucleus (CEN) concept. CEN is described as involving many educational nuclei,  each of which serves elementary and secondary education institutions within a prescribed area of control and includes the following hierarchical structure; a zonal chief; a sub-zonal coordinator; a CEN director supported by an administrative support unit, a community education council (parent, community, and teaching interests), and the educational development team (four specialists in kindergarten and basic regular education, extension education, basic laboral education, and student orientation and welfare). The aggregate of nuclei needs and plans is identified as constituting the zonal, regional, and national educational objectives. (JC)",

Major conclusions presented in Section I are: general curricular objectives must be the same for all children in most developing nations because curriculum is used to achieve national unity; there is a rural-urban continuum, rather than a dichotomy; current trends are to adapt the curriculum to a specific area and to create a series of parallel forms of the curriculum with the same general objectives; general skills should be taught because  rapid change outdates specific skills; the concept of integrated rural development seems more viable than that of ruralizing the curriculum. Among the implications for curriculum reform cited in Section II are: preliminary research on children's work experience and community resource needs should be prerequisite to any curriculum development; the most complex reform task is to account for village contributions to skill formation and village perceptions re: investment in primary schools and then to examine, from a national perspective, whether the essential disciplines taught in any primary school should be more localized and made to interact more with the community infrastructure.

        "description":"Rural development is a far more complex, long term proposition than has been generally admitted, for it involves a fundamental transformation across social, political, and economic lines. While the learning needs of rural populations vary considerably, educational planning for all rural areas should incorporate the concept of learning as a lifelong process, and the collective potential of existing formal, informal, and nonformal educational modes should be thoroughly explored. Possible means of affecting change via careful educational planning might include: (1) reorientation and transformation of the schools (area specific objectives to accomodate the majority, rather than the minority; flexible time schedules that do not tie age to grade; and concentration on a generalized  curriculum); (2) building educational components into local development projects; (3) strengthening indigenous learning systems to do a broader and better job; (4) tying related educational programs together; and (5) tapping unused resources (e.g., broadcasting systems, underutilized school facilities and teachers, etc.). These suggestions imply that educational planning must: involve all voluntary and official organizations; become more and more decentralized; be melded with development planning; pay much closer attention to the sociological, cultural, political, and organizational aspects of education; include training for non-professional planners.

        "description":"As a land of extreme rural poverty and illiteracy, Bangladesh needs to consciously promote, develop, and support local institutions and participatory leadership, involving local people in the planning, development, and implementation of developmental policies. Begun in 1959, the Comilla experiment constitutes the rationale for institutional planning, emphasizing local planning participation via local organizations, governments, and co-operatives working with governmental agencies that supply training and materials. Depending heavily upon systematized nonformal training programs, the Comilla experiment identified, trained, and educated natural rural leaders to act as change agents. Bangladesh's formal education system has traditionally emphasized the humanities, producing&quot;gentlemen&quot; contemptuous of labor and virtually unskilled. As the biggest institutional framework in Bangladesh, the formal school system has a great potential for providing basic education at the primary level and for &quot;vocationalizing&quot; secondary education. However, the immediate needs of literacy and production suggest that Bangladesh focus upon a strategy for nonformal education that includes: multisectoral community action programs; decentralized planning and implementation; a national policy to coordinate activities; integrated development; self-reliant financing; maximum use of existing institutions and resources; research and evaluation; and target specific priorities.

        "description":"Recommendations for a new emphasis in rural education have arisen out of what is seen as a crisis in education itself and an awareness of the intractabilities of the unemployment problem for youth, urban, and educated populations. Basic education (defined as programs designed to teach primarily rural children and youth the basic knowledge considered relevant to everyday life, encompassing literacy, numeracy, and the knowledge required to run a household and bring up a family) is increasingly being considered as an effective alternative to traditional primary education both on grounds of equity and its potential socioeconomic benefits. In general, there is a wide diversity of nonformal education programs which have been implemented throughout the developing world over many  decades. Examination of exemplary nonformal education programs in various developing nations (the dual primary-basic education in the Upper Volta is a case in point) reveals that, in general, nonformal education programs can provide a means of reducing inequalities inherent in earlier patterns of educational investment and that they can play important political, social, and economic roles in affecting the pattern of peoples' lives. Examples also make it clear that the establishment of dual systems can serve to institutionalize present inequalities. Hence, the design of alternative programs must coordinate the aims and objectives of the planners with those of the recipients. (JC)",

Data were collected and analyzed on the household and individual family members residing in those households at the time. Data were obtained on: the household's geographic location by county, township, range, and section; household income; housing status (financing, renting); house structure (rooms, heating system, bathroom facilities, water source); tribal language usage; voter registration; social services utilized by the household; education; institutional enrollment; tribal affiliation; degree of Indian blood; employment patterns; occupational skills; job stability; job  location relative to home residence; and organizations and persons used in emergencies. Using Creek Indian people who were familiar with the Nation, data were collected in eight counties: Creek, Hughes (including Seminole) McIntosh, Muskogee, Okfuskee, Okmulgee, Tulsa, and Wagoner (including Rogers and Mayes). Of the 1,888 households drawn from a master list, 1,225 usable questionnaires were returned for computer analysis. As requested by Creek Nation officials, this report presents only percentages and frequencies by category within each variable. Data for each variable are repeated three times under the following formats: all membership or households combined; urban vs. rural; and county-by-county. (NQ)",

From among 9,000 ethnically stratified (black, Mexican American, and other) fifth grade students participating in a sequence of outdoor camping experiences, 400 students were randomly selected as an experimental group; 100 non-camping  students made up the control group. Both groups were given pre and post attitudinal questionnaires, and the experimental group was given the same instrument three months after the camping experience to determine if there were any carryover. Additionally, 35 participating teachers were given an opinionnaire for purposes of program improvement. In general, findings indicated that there were positive attitudinal changes as a result of the program. Among the recommendations made for future programs were: shorter nature walks; an opinionnaire for the parents of participating students; more clearly defined teacher roles; followup on the experimental group; etc. (JC)",

        "description":"The Revenue Sharing Act appropriated $30.2 billion for distribution to State and local governments, including Indian tribes and Alaskan native villages, according to specified formulas for a 5-year period beginning January 1, 1972. Through June 30, 1974, funds were distributed to 230 Indian tribes located in 29 States and to 93 Alaskan native villages. Thirty-five Indian tribes and Alaskan native villages were visited to examine financial and other records and reports, and to discuss revenue sharing activities with local officials to determine how funds were being administered and used. Office of Revenue Sharing and BIA officials were also visited to obtain information on their administration of the program. Although the Act provides that Indian tribes and Alaskan native villages  which perform &quot;substantial governmental functions&quot; are eligible to receive revenue sharing, more reasonable and uniform eligibility determinations are required. Funds allocated to tribes and villages at the county level are based on the ratio of tribe or village population to the county area population. Since this method is inequitable, the Congress should change the procedure so that each tribe or village within a State is allocated a portion of revenue sharing funds available for local government allocation on the basis of the ratio of the tribe or village population to the State population.

The study design included a three-member team and: visits to all Northland Schools (N=30); meetings with all school staff; public meetings held in each Northland Community; written briefs submitted by people outside the Northland Division; sub-studies (N=4); consultations with representative advisory groups; visits to other northern school jurisdictions; and extensive  consultations with the trustees. Major findings were: (1) the academic achievement of students in Northland was considerably below the provincial norm; (2) the transiency and generally poor qualifications of Northland teachers had contributed to poor achievement in the schools; (3) the governing and administrative procedures in Northland needed to be revised to permit a greater degree of local involvement and self-direction. One hundred specific recommendations were made re: governance; curriculum; pupils and services; high school services; teaching staff; supervisory staff; school buildings and grounds; teachers' residences; maintenance; libraries, supplies, and equipment; business and finance; etc. (JC)",

Since then the project-work and design has been further developed and now also includes studying the school in its social environment. The project's main objective is to analyze the total situation and development of the pupils in a nongraded school system and in the alternative which would be actual if the small school is closed. This alternative would be a graded system in a school far away from home. In this situation the pupils get even farther daily-travelling than they are used to, or they have to live at a boarding house during the week. Presenting an orientation of the work on different levels  of the project, this report discusses: (1) the PANG-project and its place in the Swedish School Research Program; (2) the organization of non-graded education in Stollet, a small lower secondary school in Varmland; (3) the organization of non-graded education in Hallen, a small lower secondary school in Jamtland; (4) non-graded teaching in general subjects in Hallen; (5) non-graded teaching in English in Solberg; and (6) non-graded instruction in small rural lower secondary schools.

However, some of its accomplishments which should help the Indian community to deal with problems at the local level were: (1) the development of the Michigan Indian Legal Service Corporation which will provide legal services to Indians in the State; (2) the utilization of Indian groups and organizations in the development of manpower programs; (3) the development of a proposal which was granted $150,000 to repair Indian homes in the Peshawbestown area; (4) the  development of a program which operates 25 Indian community workers in 25 counties throuhgout the State; and (5) the continuation of developing and expanding Indian units within departments of State governments. Programs and legislation were less than helpful due to the reduced level of expenditures in both Federal and State programs.

        "description":"Though 1.3 times the U.S. rate, American Indian mortality has decreased 17% since 1955. About 225 fewer Indians died of tuberculosis in 1974 than in 1955. The incidences of cirrhosis of the liver and diabetes mellitus are both far above the U.S. rates. Otitis media may have peaked at 50,000 new cases per year, but Indian health continues 25 years behind the health of most Americans. Since over 50% of all reservation Indians are under age 19, the Indian youth population significantly affects the aggregate income, employment, and health statistics for Indians. One-half of the 500,000 reservation Indians subsist in poverty, and 50% of these are under age 18. Efforts to ameliorate the income and employment disadvantages of Indian youth through vocational training appear to have  failed. By itself, education has not furthered the incomes or job opportunities of Indians of all ages relative to the non-Indian. A stagnation or possible decline in reservation Indian education enrollment has apparently occurred. Increases in Indian enrollment are being absorbed by public schools. The dropout rate among Indians enrolled in Federal, public, and mission schools remains disturbingly high at 35%. Moreover, there were significantly fewer (16%) high school seniors graduating from Federal schools in 1975 than in 1969. (JC)",

The relationship between the English reading ability of the  children with their Spanish reading ability was also examined. Complete data were obtained from 111 chidlren and 25 teachers. Half of the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills' reading sections, a 16-item reading attitude test, and a 5-item teacher questionnaire were used. Some of the findings indicated that: attendance was greater when Chicano teachers and aides were in the classrooms; students whose teachers used the language experience approach more often showed an increase of 2.9 raw score points more on English reading standardized test scores; and younger children gained more than 2.77 raw score points in reading Spanish than did older children (teachers of younger children used the language experience approach &quot;quite often&quot;).

        "description":"Focusing on the migrant farmworkers in eight South Carolina counties which employed a large number of migrants, the situational study examined some of their socioeconomic characteristics and problems. A questionnaire was administered to obtain data on: the number and location of migrants, racial and family composition, family economy, housing situation, children's education, health situation, and social environment. Of the 366 migrant workers interviewed during the summer of 1971, 294 had families. The study showed that the problem of the children's education was effectively handled through the Summer Migrant Program of the State Department of Education. Free medical assistance was provided for some of the migrants in several county health clinics. The most critical problem for  the migrants was their housing conditions. They had no choice except to live in substandard housing. Charleston County provided three county operated camps for migrants; however, these accommodated only a few of the migrants who came into Charleston County. Another major problem faced by the migrants was their low earning power. Most of them had no cash savings accumulated. Social outlets for the migrants and their children were quite limited. Migrants visited the towns only to shop and to visit the health clinics. Otherwise, their social activities were confined to their camps. (Author/NQ)",

Randomly selected from the Community Action Program files, approximately 100 households in Las Cruces, the main urban center, and 60 households in the small rural communities of Dona Ana and La Mesa (30 in each) were interviewed in the fall of 1969 and the winter of 1970. Interviews were conducted either in English or Spanish as the respondents preferred. A follow-up study was done in 1975 by a brief questionnaire mailed out twice to the original 160 respondents. The 71 returned questionnaires were compared to the original 71 questionnaires of 1969-70. The 1969-70 findings included: most stated one should know the firm or an employee &quot;well&quot; before buying  any major item (above $200) at a store; most spent over a month of &quot;search-time&quot; in deciding on what and where to buy; fewer than 12% had checking accounts; fewer than 16% had savings accounts; about 3/10 of the families shopped in Juarez, Mexico for &quot;cheaper&quot; and &quot;different&quot; foods; and the high rate of indebtedness was usually for medical, death, or cars. The 1975 findings included: the average respondent reported being farther in debt, but felt they were better able to handle the indebtedness; over 30% were on the food stamp plan; and the majority of purchases over $200 were on credit.

Obtained from the 1970 Philippines population census, data were collected for both males and females aged 25-64 on literacy; level of educational attainment; major field of study of associate, college and post-graduate  degree holders; major and minor industry; major and minor occupation; and class of worker. Data were compiled for three residential categories: Manila, urban areas outside Manila, and rural areas. A combination of size-density and &quot;urban characteristics&quot; criteria was used in the 1970 census to delineate urban areas. Findings included: 72% of rural females aged 25-64 were literate, compared to 95% of Manila women in the same age range; the gap between males and females was largest in the rural areas; 3 of 5 rural women aged 25-64 had less than 5 years of formal schooling; and 2 out of 5 rural women aged 25-64 were engaged in farm laborer work roles.

Computed from the 1972-73 athletic budgets of 40 Texas school districts, these measures are presented for general use. After explaining the goals, assumptions, methods, and limitations of the study, this report presents a statistical picture of the participating districts to enable readers to determine whether the computed measures are applicable to their own schools. These schools range between 242 and 942 in average daily attendance, are located in towns with a  median 1970 population of 1,144, and are defined as small schools. The third section of this report presents the statistical measures computed for these school budgets and interprets them from the standpoint of their value as planning guidelines and evaluation criteria. Separate treatment is given to each of three classes of comparative data--measures of central tendency for planning or appraising the absolute levels of budget components, percentage ratios, and per capita ratios. Summarizing the findings, the final section concludes that the computed measures should help small school administrators answer comparative questions. (JC)",

In March 1976, there were about 11 million persons of Spanish origin in the U.S.: an estimated 6.6 million of Mexican origin, 1.8 million of Puerto Rican origin, about 700,000 of Cuban origin, 800,000 of Central or South American origin, and 1.3 million of other Spanish origin. Of the 2.5 million families, 2.1 million were living in metropolitan areas. The median age was 20.9 years; about 13% were under 5 years of  age. The proportion of single men was higher than that of single women. Women were more likely to be divorced or widowed than were men. Only 39% of the persons 25 years and over were high school graduates; about 19% of all persons of Spanish origin had completed less than 5 years of school. The labor force participation rate was 77% for men and 43% for women. About 2.2 million of the men were employed compared to 1.3 million of the women. The most prevalent occupation for men was that of operative, including transportation. The median income was $6,800 for men and $3,200 for women.

        "description":"Data derived from 1,423 adults who were permanent residents in 9 northwest Wisconsin counties in 1974 were used to test the hypothesis that peripheral metropolitan ring areas (within 30 miles of cities over 50,000) have more pleasing natural environments and more desirable social settings than urban areas and offer better access to jobs and services than rural areas. Dependent measures were drawn from 39 community and environmental items tapping 3 quality of life dimensions -- the natural environment, social relations, and facilities/services. Eight individual (age, education, sex, marital status, household size, residential duration, family income, and organizational membership and two ecological (size and distance from urban center) variables were employed. Results indicated  persons living in the ring areas: rated their environment more favorably than urbanites; rated their social setting less favorably than either urbanites or rural people; and rated their social services less positively than rural people. Persons living in small towns and open country areas beyond the 30-mile perimeter rated their environment higher than urbanites and, with a few exceptions, higher than rural dwellers; rated their social setting, with 2 exceptions, higher than urbanites and, with 2 exceptions, higher than ring area dwellers; rated their job opportunities and many other services higher than suburbanites.

Responses to similar questions asked in a 1973 study of Ashland, Burnett, and Rusk Counties and in a 1974 statewide survey were used for comparisons. Responses to the three areas of concern were categorized as: (1) most important community problems (national economy, local economy, taxes, lack of public services, disorder, lack of cooperation, environment); (2) public services (job opportunities, public schools, public libraries, fire protection, water supply, medical services, crime prevention/control, police relations,  neighborhood safety at night, streets/roads, public transportation, stores/retail services, indoor and nearby recreation); (3) environmental concerns (stream, lake, and/or air pollution; soil erosion; wildlife reduction; litter; crowded recreation areas; noise; people living too close). Comparative analysis revealed: the overriding concern was economic; the magnitude of economic problems had increased during 1974; the general perception of specific environmental problems was stronger than in 1973; public service problems were in the areas of transportation, medical care, retail services, and indoor recreation.

        "description":"The origins of the Oklahoma Delaware reflect a complex history of migration, forced relocation, and punitive concentration. Though 36 tribal identities survive today, they are not of equal cultural coherence. Among the Delaware, there is no simple relation between socioeconomic status, level of acculturation, and factional membership. Rather, the emergence of complementary roles played out in mutually satisfying transactions between elders and organizers, ritual specialists, and persons in need of ritual services constitute the politically significant rallying point for factional alliance wherein retribalization takes place. Virtually all Delaware are of mixed ancestory, and legal &quot;Indianness&quot; does not by itself constitute ethnic identity, since it is defined only by pedigree and  not by behavior. Legal Indians become social Indians in Oklahoma if they participate in certain public social situations labeled &quot;Indian doings&quot; and orient themselves to a set of standards known as the &quot;Indian way&quot;. Since language, the most powerful symbol of Indian identity, is the least used symbol in Oklahoma, the Delaware abide by a set of &quot;moral ground rules&quot; that cross tribal frontiers and define Indian behavior. Conscious, elaborated expression of identity is manifest in public events or &quot;crisis observances&quot; where &quot;badges&quot; of identity are displayed. Badges of identity are also operative in private expression of identity. (JC)",

Data presented on the research progress suggest: (1) the ES districts are indicative of a changing rural America that is less dependent upon farming and more economically diverse; (2) factors contributing to program readiness are social forces external to the school system, recognition in the system of unmet needs, experience in Federal programs, and administrative commitment to change; (3) factors contributing to project initiation are broad-based  participation and influence, independence from extensive ES influence, school district acceptance of the project, and congruence between locally identified problems and project goals; (4) factors influencing quick implementation are expanding economy; high median family income; large, homogeneous, and geographically concentrated population; easy access to urban areas; and community satisfaction with community life; (5) influential organizational characteristics are experienced faculty, strong administrative leadership, teacher/administrator readiness for change, access to new educational ideas, coordination of teacher planning activities, and past experience with systematic educational change.

Two thousand twenty-seven students were tested to develop the instrument and the description of its characteristics. The final form consisted of 24 items with four subtests each of six items for Piagetian levels: Concrete Operational I, Concrete Operational II, Formal Operational I, and Formal Operational II. Piagetian task interviews were also given to a group of students, and the paper-pencil test results correlated positively with the task results of the students who took both tests. Content, concurrent construct, divergent, and convergent validity measurements showed the paper-pencil test to be valid. The  test was also shown to have a high reliability and good item discrimination between proportional reasoning levels. (MH)",

This model defines seven levels of use of an innovation, ranging from no knowledge of the innovation, through routine use, to looking for better alternatives. The inventory was developed to complement interviews to determine an individual's level. The inventory was twice administered to 33 elementary school teachers attending a summer institute to familiarize them with the Science Curriculum Improvement Study (SCIS), which they would be using in the fall. Concurrent validity for the inventory was shown to be 0.71, test-retest reliability was 0.94, and there was  perfect interrater reliability using two independent judges. The results of the study indicated that a valid and reliable estimate of the levels of use could be determined if the particular teacher was observed in the actual process of using the innovation.

Questionnaires sent to 6 school districts, selected somewhat randomly from across the 50 states and the District of Columbia, compiled information regarding practices employed in the implementation of the NSF curriculum and their recommendations for more successful implementation. Responses revealed that schools using NSF materials were moderate or larger in size, having some departmentalization in science, teaching science in a class-size group, having some instruction assistance (e.g., aids), having become aware of curriculum in use through NSF awareness conferences or college/university  consultants, and having selected the curriculum through a local curriculum committee or by a science consultant/supervisor. Recommendations for successful implementation of NSF curricula are listed, including conditions for teacher training, evaluation, equipment and materials, facilities, and pilot programs. The two highest rated recommendations were: (1) teachers should receive training in the teaching strategies of the curriculum; and (2) teachers' understanding of learning theories and intellectual development should be coupled with the implementation efforts.

On another level it provides the \"hands-on\" experiences that open the bounds of the usual four-walled classroom and allows the student and instructor to develop a learning motif that is limited only by their imaginations. Finally, at its most creative level, the design is structured to acquaint student and instructor with the principles of values and decision-making. Through a multi-disciplined approach, the design attempts to engage student and instructor in the complex problems of priorities and personal world.  Confidence and curiosity should be magnified through this exercise, exciting student and instructor to step beyond the limits of their present knowledge. Each investigation contains suggestions for setting the stage, a series of tasks to be done individually or in small groups, task card samples to be used with these activities, summary activities and questions, supplementary charts and tables where appropriate, and in some instances, additional information about the type of teaching activity to be used.

An understanding of the nature of scientific laws and theories was used as an indicator of the broad \"nature of science\" concept. Fifty junior high and middle school science teachers in Wisconsin were randomly chosen to respond to a Likert-type opinionaire developed by the author. The opinionaire contained 56 statements about laws and theories, representing publised viewpoints and logical alternatives of five scientific philosophers (Carnap, Hempel, Popper, Kemeny, and Lachman). Statements were grouped for analysis. Data analysis indicated that the teachers held divergent opinions concerning the structure of laws and theories, and that they were philosophically inconsistent in their responses (with  statements identified with Lachman receiving the greatest degree of endorsement and those identified with Popper the least).

        "description":"A review of the Environmental Education (EE) program for the first four years of Youth Conservation Corps (YCC) identified a number of things: (1) despite national guidelines, EE programs varied greatly from camp to camp in both quantity and quality; (2) many camps needed some assistance to help them translate their somewhat vague EE goals into a clearly specified educational program for enrollees; (3) the national Environmental Awareness Test was not adequate to the tasks of providing summary data on the program and diagnostic feedback to individual camps. A solution to these problems was proposed in the summer of 1975 and tested in four camps. The solution involves each camp defining its EE program as a collection of behavioral objectives -- statements which describe specific  outcomes which the camp staff think can be achieved by the enrollees. The behavioral objectives for each camp are unique, yet they follow the broad guidelines for EE programs supplied by Washington. A camp's objectives are entered into a scorecard which is used during the season to track individual enrollee progress. The information from all enrollees is summarized by the camp staff at the end of the summer and used to modify the program for the coming season. Included in the publication are samples of scorecards, suggestions for effective use, and samples of data from camps where they were used. (Author/RH)",

Observers spent approximately one week in each camp, interviewing all minority enrollees, a sample of White enrollees, and most staff persons. Interviews and observations followed structured protocols. This report summarizes the observations and recommendations of these observers. In addition, it includes two background papers on the perspectives and needs of Blacks and Native Americans as they apply to the YCC program. Instrumentation appears in the appendices. In general, it was found  that minorities in the YCC program have a very positive experience. Recommendations are for the purpose of further strengthening the program to insure proper conditions will exist to meet minority needs. Recommendations fall in the area of recruitment of both enrollees and staff, optimum camp size and minimum numbers of minorities, camp program (work projects, work safety, environmental education, recreation, food, staff meetings), and staff training.

Six part-time regional consultants were selected to be field representatives of the project. Regional consultants responded to requests for consultation from school districts and other responsible groups and individuals. The efficacy of using part-time regional consultants was measured in two dimensions, cost effectiveness and reception and perceived effectiveness by users. The cost for using part-time consultants that are strategically located was found to be one-half that of centrally  located personnel. Data collected by questionnaire sent to persons requesting services revealed that only 7.2% of the respondents expressed a negative opinion about the assistance provided by the consultants. (CS)",

Two hundred five ninth graders were assigned to a control group or one of four experimental instruction groups. The experimental instruction was received by watching a discrepant event until 6 acceptable hypotheses were written. The instructor then evaluated each of the 6 hypotheses by one of four predetermined standards which varied in reinforcement (either differentiated positive or no reinforcement) and criteria group (either mention or no mention of the criteria for good hypothesis formation). Following the instruction, all groups were shown two discrepant events and were requested to write  hypotheses for one and questions for the other. Five days later another event was observed by each group; students then asked questions of the investigator which were answered yes or no. Conclusions regarding which method of instruction produced the best results when compared to no instruction involved predominantly the approaches of reinforcement alone and reinforcement plus criteria. Reinforcement was essential for greater quantity of written hypotheses; for quality, reinforcement plus knowledge of the criteria was superior to no instruction. Differences in short- and long-term applications were mentioned. (CS)",

        "author":["Neumann, Manfred J. M."],
        "description":"The dominant driving force of past movements in West German output and prices is investigated and a review of government policy undertaken to stabilize these movements is presented. Three alternative impulse hypotheses are tested: the monetary, the fiscal, and the foreign impulse hypothesis. The major results of the tests are that: (1) monetary impulses dominate fiscal impulses in shaping cyclical fluctuations of domestic output as well as of the price level; (2) while the evidence corroborates the hypothesis that fiscal impulses contribute to the emergence of inflation, it does not support the contention that fiscal impulses have any significant net effects on the growth of output in the shorter run; and (3) real foreign impulses play a significant role with respect to both  movements of the domestic price level as well as changes in output. The author concludes that the traditional tying of government spending and tax policies to the shorter run considerations of stabilization policy lacks justification. Chapters provide some basic information on the performance of the economy during the past two decades, describe the testing of the three impulse hypotheses, and discuss the controllability of the money supply. The last chapter presents a summary and conclusions. Charts, statistical tables, graphs and footnotes are presented. The document concludes with comments on the paper by James M. Boughton of Indiana University. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"This essay compares Germany's persistent financial disequilibrium with the balance of payments situation in the United States. Delivered at a Symposium on German Economic Growth and Stability, the author concentrates on Germany's balance of payments surplus and presents U.S. figures mainly as a point of comparison. The material on Germany has been subdivided into four topics: (1) &quot;structural aspects,&quot; which is said to include strong post war capital goods demands, high export rates and industry efficiency, all of which are associated with a high propensity for average and marginal savings; (2) &quot;absorption,&quot; which is defined as the difference between output and spending; (3) &quot;the level of domestic investment,&quot; which the author maintains is lower in Germany than in foreign markets  due to a sluggish German response to interest rate changes; and (4) &quot;policy,&quot; which the author points out is consistently set in the direction of resisting inflation, regardless of other variables. The conclusion is that well-functioning capital markets and international coordination are necessary to counteract the absorption which presently dominates the current-account balance. Comments on the paper by William P. Travis of Indiana University are presented as are tables, charts, and excerpts from economic literature. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"American and European business taxation policies are compared in this booklet. Topics discussed in the paper include effects of the corporation income tax, integration of income taxation, and the value added tax. Two major differences between the American and European systems are noted. First, European countries derive substantial portions of their tax revenues from the tax on value added (TVA), a form of general sales tax, whereas the federal government of the United States levies no general sales tax. The second important difference is that most common market members allow relief from the double taxation of dividends, whereas the United States business tax system allows no such exemption. The author concludes that the present American system of taxing corporation source income  has serious defects from both allocating and distributional points of view and that there should be at least partial integration of the corporation income tax and the personal income tax. Footnotes and references are included. (Author/DB)",

        "author":["Wiley, Karen B."],
        "description":"Discussion of National Science Foundation (NSF) funding of precollege science education revolves around the controversy of whether NSF should fund &quot;Man: A Course of Study&quot; (MACOS). NSF had funded MACOS' curriculum development, implementation, and postevaluation during 1963-1975. The controversy began in March 1975 when U.S. Congressman John Conlan introduced a measure to the House Committee on Science and Technology to bar further funding of MACOS in support of Phoenix schools' moral opposition to MACOS. The controversy quickly expanded to four major political issues: (1) the proper allocation of economic activity between the public and private sectors; (2) the proper division of power between the federal and local governments; (3) the proper distribution of power, authority, and  decision-making roles among scientists-bureaucrats and citizens-politicians; and (4) which values should dominate public activity, scientific or traditional. The related events during 1975 are presented, such as activity and reports of the House of Representatives, letters, and news media reports. Specifically looked at are Harvey Averch's NSF testimony to the House in February 1975, NSF's disposition of its 19 current projects, and the House debate on the 1977 budget. In response to the controversy, NSF decided to stop funding curriculum implementation projects, continue funding curriculum development at a reduced level, and begin various monitoring procedures. An extensive reading list on related topics is included. (ND)",

Preceding the course descriptions is an article on textbook analysis which reviews evidence of female-oriented material in U.S. history and in English literature textbooks. The 23 syllabi and descriptions of curricula included in this volume are divided into three categories: history, literature, and interdisciplinary  studies. The nine history courses illustrate new directions among scholars in women's history: the need to reperiodize history, the use of autobiographies, and the inclusion of class and race to describe women in history. Seven literature courses emphasize writing skills, independent and thoughtful investigation and analysis, and use of family histories and TV situations. Seven courses are described in the interdisciplinary section, all based on women's studies topics. Most of the course descriptions include purpose, goals, content, and further suggestions. All are identified by the teacher and school that developed the course. (ND)",

        "description":"The author discusses the meaning of communication and how changes in methods of communication are creating new classroom tools and educational techniques. The inquiry hypothesis is reviewed in terms of its four component elements which suggest relationships between learning and how people communicate. (1) Curiosity is the force that impels the prospective learner to certain encounters with new facts or experiences rather than to alternative encounters which are also available. (2) Motivation, which propels and defines inquiry, is based on the medium of the encounter, nature of the phenomena being encountered, and the total environment in which the encounter occurs. (3) The focus of the inquiry, how the inquirer articulates what he wants to know, is usually expressed verbally. (4)  The inquirer's total life experience which is brought to the encounter gives it particular meaning different from that which other inquirers would experience. Because the inquiry hypothesis implies that learning is an individual act, it requires new ways of looking at communication which have equal applicability to the teaching/learning relationship in any situation. The author discusses the need for history teachers to be more responsive to current problems and students' backgrounds; recognize television's role as a teaching/learning medium; involve students in \"doing\" history, for example, recording family history; pay attention to changing conditions of education and its institutions; and develop better communication among history educators.

        "description":"The interrelationship of population growth, food production, and death rates is explored. Birth rates in China, Western Europe, and North America have significantly decreased in the five-year period from 1970-75. This is largely due to widening availability of family planning services and the growing desire to use them. Four European countries have reached stability in population growth: East and West Germany, Austria, and Luxembourg. Reasons for this stability include high levels of income, high levels of education and employment for women, and easy access to contraceptives. Death rates, however, have increased due to hunger and nutritional stress in areas such as Bangladesh, India, Ethiopia, and the Sahelian countries of Africa. Even in cases where food crises arise from civil  insurrection, the groups most vulnerable to the stresses of starvation are children and the elderly. Food production in many countries has been so hampered by weather changes and abuse of ecological factors that current production cannot keep up even with limited population growth. Governments can try to reduce population growth by providing family planning services, satisfying basic social needs, educating all social groups about the effects of rapid population growth, providing alternative careers to motherhood, and reshaping national social and economic policies to encourage small families.

The purposes of the project are to explore phenomena conceptualization and to investigate why some students are more successful at a learning task than other students. In the analysis of a microeconomics course, student comprehension of economic concepts and principles was assessed. Students were interviewed on basic economic questions before, during, and after participating in the course. Findings were evaluated over three semesters, with an experimental course in microeconomics instituted during the fourth semester. Characteristic ways in which students understood and misunderstood basic concepts such as opportunity cost,  production and cost functions, and utility and costs are described. A preliminary conclusion is that student understanding of basic concepts would increase if learning was described in terms of the structural aspects of the learning process such as forgetting, remembering, problem solving, or adhering to a specific teaching method.

        "description":"Differences in levels of subject matter learning at the university level were explored to determine how a learning task is approached between those who are successful and those who are less successful. Students read a selected social science text, (Paul Samuelson's \"Economics\", for example), related the material learned, answered content questions, gave personal impressions of the learning activity, and discussed general attitudes toward university studies. A second interview, five to six weeks later, concentrated on retention of previously learned material. Two major attitudes appeared to be connected with two different conceptions of learning--one that learning is something a person does and the other that learning is something that happens to a person. These attitudes  determined to a large extent the things students learned, as well as the different ways in which they learned. These findings indicated that learning should be described in terms of the structural aspect of its content. In the section exploring the relationship between knowledge and skill, it is shown through experimentation with physics phenomena in a problem-solving situation that cognitive skills are aspects of knowledge, rather than independent of knowledge. Remarks on the debate on education during the 1970s and on separate categories of thought are offered.

        "description":"This study investigates preferences of public support for allocation of expenditures toward environmental controls or toward economic growth from 1973-1975. The author considered four previously noted correlates of environmental support--education, family income, place of residence, and political orientation. Two state-wide surveys were conducted to examine the environmental control/economic growth question. Both North Carolina surveys were conducted in the same manner. In 1973 and 1975, questionnaires were mailed to 5,082 heads of households. These residents were asked whether they wanted less, the same, or more tax dollars allocated to air pollution and water pollution control. Findings indicate that there was a significant decrease in the desired level of public support for  both items, although there was a significant increase in desired expenditures to promote agricultural and industrial development. As suggested by previous literature, education was positively correlated with support for air and water pollution controls. Contrary to most findings, however, income was not consistently related to support for either item. In summary, support for environmental controls decreased while support for economic development increased from 1973-75, indicating that reaction to public issues responds quickly to societal situations. Changes in the situation of the population between 1973 and 1975 seem to have been great enough to have similar impact on the public responses to environmental issues regardless of socioeconomic differences. A list of references concludes the  document. (Author/DB)",

The purpose of the conference, attended by local educators and museum personnel, was to explore specific interrelationship problems between museums and schools concerning five educational activities. The activities investigated were curriculum design, field trips, museum tours, museum outreach activities, and teacher training and teaching methods. Prior to the conference, a 28-statement questionnaire was developed to elicit reaction to the five school-museum activities. Respondents ranked each problem statement for agreement on a scale of one to five. The response  results and emergent additional questions became the discussion topics for the conference. Conference participants were divided into groups to discuss the questionnaire results and accompanying questions, suggest additional topics, and rank the educational activities according to need and usefulness. Priority ordering of the activities was (1) staff development and teacher training as most important to cultural education, (2) curriculum development, (3) outreach, (4) field trip, and (5) tour as least important to initiate. Appendices contain the tally of questionnaire responses, Roundtable membership list, copy of questionnaire, and list of conference participants. (ND)",

        "description":"This study of the traditional elementary social studies curriculum was conducted during 1974-76 in 16 school systems in cities of 10,000 and above population in Iowa and southern Minnesota. A traditional social studies curriculum incorporates history and geography, but not other social science fields. The purposes of the study were to (1) determine relevant areas of the traditional social studies curriculum, (2) determine desirable curriculum additions in terms of contemporary student needs, and (3) compile a profile of elementary social studies teachers and determine the relationship between their backgrounds and how they rate curriculum. The Curriculum Rating Scale (CRS) and the Teacher Information Form (TIF) were developed and used. The traditional curriculum was rated by  1,615 elementary school teachers according to topics it covers, and the teachers supplied information about their backgrounds, working conditions, and preferences. Composite profiles on CRS ratings were plotted for significant TIF scale values and categories. Analysis of teacher responses indicates that, while part of the traditional curriculum should be retained, a considerable portion of it could be replaced by topics more relevant to students. Also, both inservice training in social studies and changes in classroom organization could result in more effective implementation of social studies curriculum, both traditional and innovative. Appendices provide data tables of course ratings by grade level, teacher backgrounds, classroom materials used, classroom organization, curriculum  selection factors, curriculum additions by grade level, and copies of CRS and TIF.

The second chapter discusses the colonial government of New York through excerpts from a 1774 governor's  report. A letter of transmittal of the Constitution of 1777 is included in original handwriting in the third chapter. A handwritten sample of the 1777 Constitution of the State of New York is presented in the fourth chapter. The bulk of the document, contained in chapter five, is a reprint of the 1846 Constitution of the State of New York. The last chapter presents a 1977 referendum that includes the questions, who should serve as delegates? what changes should be made? and what kind of government should New York state have?

A breakdown has occurred in former socializing institutions, such as the family and church, which have ceased to influence civic education. There is a need to reconceptualize the socialization process. Four factors that impede the socialization of responsible citizenry are the mobility of Americans, the depersonalizing influence of television, the impersonal political environment, and increasing reliance on technical inventions and mechanical solutions. The role of the federal government in creating better citizenship education is to serve as a catalytic agent to foster the efforts of community members, parents, teachers, and school administrators. Suggestions for improving citizenship  education focus generally on the improvement of basic skills and an inculcation of responsibility. Programs would include improved knowledge of what it means to be an American, a sense of national community with a global perspective, and a revitalized sense of place. Curriculum materials would be gathered from the social sciences and ethical education and would stress a global and multicultural approach. Development of indices for national assessment of citizenship by the Citizen Education Task Force of the federal government is discussed. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"A guide for infusing global perspectives on communication into the elementary social studies curriculum is designed to be used selectively by teachers. The four major objectives are to help students: (1) understand how the world's system can influence the individual's life; (2) recognize different viewpoints; (3) develop an ability to make judgments about world influence on one's personal life; and (4) recognize that personal actions can influence world interrelatedness. Section I presents ideas for developing ten communication activities. The activities involve message-sending skills, body language, animal language, sign observation, vocabulary building, and family and stranger communication skills. For each topic, areas of study are specified, objectives are listed, and  teaching techniques are suggested. Section II presents lessons which demonstrate how global perspectives fit in with the existing curriculum. The four lessons stress verbal and nonverbal communication, body language, and exploration of human commonalities and differences. Four activities, such as mime, charades, using makeup, creating bulletin boards, communication games, art work, and field trips, are suggested for each lesson, along with a description of areas of study, objectives, suggested time, and required materials.

The study is arranged in five chapters. The first chapter examines the relationships among the creative process, the cultural context, and socio-economic influences. The second chapter presents the framework within which the main lines of innovation have developed. Topics discussed are basic assumptions of educational innovation, particulars of secondary schools in Italy, difficulties encountered with new knowledge and new practices, and factors which cause the new information to be adopted. Five case studies are presented in the third chapter. Each case study includes description of the course, objectives, content and organization of  the experiment, and an assessment. The schools hosting the experimental courses are located in Rome, Milan, Lombardy, and Reggio Emilia. The courses deal with the languages and codes of communication technology, mass communication, the environment, school community relationship, and data processing. Chapter four discusses the relationship between machines and men in the Italian educational system, followed by presentation of summary and conclusions in chapter five. Factors identified as contributing to educational innovation are willingness to change objectives and experiment. Factors hindering change are traditional methods, social confusion, and divergent expectations. (Author/DB)",

The study bridges the gap between previous research and present concerns of policymakers. The report draws upon longitudinal household data; employs new methodological techniques; and defines explanatory variables to correspond to factors of policy interest, such as instituting policies which facilitate migration, investing to expand economic opportunities, and applying income bonuses to finance job searches in other labor markets. Section I discusses previous migration research and describes the purpose of this report as introducing an appropriate migration model. Section II presents the underlying conceptual framework and some general hypotheses  derived from it. Section III discusses data, sample, estimation techniques, and definitions of variables. In section IV, specific hypotheses explaining whether or not a family migrates are proposed and tested. The choice of destination analysis is presented in section V. The report concludes, in Section VI, with a summary of the seven main findings, a discussion of the policy implications of the research, and suggestions for further research. Included among findings are that unemployment, job dissatisfaction, and wives' opinions have a significant influence on a family's decision to move. References are included. (Author/DB)",

Chapters one through five describe (1) the varied work and the status of American Indian women and the marriage customs of these early times; (2) the hardships and harsh hazards faced by frontier women in Illinois; (3) women's efforts during the Civil War; (4) the period from 1870 to 1920 when women actively sought to improve their legal, economic, and social position; and (5) the women's movement from the 1920s to the present. The  last chapter describes and provides information on the Carbondale Women's Center, the Institute of Women Today, the Illinois Women's Agenda, women's health care, the Coalition of Labor Union Women, and the Equal Rights Amendment in Illinois.

The intent of the committee is two-fold: first, to fill a gap in research on the human life cycle and, second, to respond to social patterns and policy issues that have emerged in the 1970s. Committee achievements include serving as an information center, defining the field of inquiry, contacting international scholars, and participating in international conferences. Topics  of committee discussions and seminars include stress symptoms, midlife crisis, death and social time, interaction between work and personality, women in midlife, career analysis, life roles, life cycle, social support, and life cycle aspects of earnings.

The guidelines presented in this booklet are based on the assumption that the transcript will be edited in an accepted manuscript format. Obtaining a good transcriber/editor is emphasized. Before beginning to transcribe, basic elements of editorial policy should be set in order to maintain uniformity in transcribing. Individual interviews may be transcribed and edited with slight variations according to the nature of the  interview. Examples of editing styles are provided for overlapping speech, syntax, inaccuracies, false starts, dangling sentences, fuzzy thinking, and paragraphing. Suggestions are made for performing the audit check as a quality control and for making interviewee corrections of the transcript as accountability. Instructions for putting the final text together cover the table of contents, headings, and indexing. Samples of transcribing and editing guidelines, an audit check sheet, the title page, and a transcript page conclude the document. (ND)",

Emphasis is placed on the function of social scientists and social science data and techniques in the legal process. The document contains seven articles. Article I presents background information on the relationship between social science, constitutional rights, and the courts. The article concludes that social equality must be left to the courts because legal perspectives are not influenced by majority prejudices and power. Article II maintains that social science data should be used selectively in judicial decision-making. This article is followed by an analysis of the uncertainties in the relationship of social sciences to constitutional rights. Article IV  proposes that social science data should focus on how to improve desegregated educational programs rather than how to devise alternative remedies. Article V comments on the roles played by social science in recent school finance cases and maintains that the courts should not surrender judicial responsibility to a deference for social science. In article VI, the relationship between social science and social policy concerning schools and race is explored. The concluding article reports on the struggle for a useful role for the social sciences in school integration. (Author/DB)",

It also provides students with a convenient reference to current developments in theory and research concepts related to family planning, home economics, and population education. Although the nine readings selected represent the general themes of women and education, each reflects a different perspective and draws on many sources for its substance. Part I consists of six articles about the status and role of women in economic life. The  articles cover an international perspective on women's rights, family planning, and family size; rights and opportunities of women in education; design of education for females; changing roles of women, family dynamics, and fertility; rural women in Africa; and the woman in Latin America. Part II deals with family planning and population education; and the relationship of family planning to savings and consumption in Taiwan. (Author/ND)",

The first chapter presents an overview of survey results. Findings indicate that 13- and 17-year-olds express similar social and political attitudes, have a high degree of respect for human rights, and favor political participation. The second chapter defines the variables and describes the conventions used to report the data. Social attitudinal trends, including opposition to  discrimination, support for equal-housing opportunities and racial trust, are described in chapter three. An assessment of political attitudes is included in chapter four. Knowledge of criminal rights, court role, constitutional rights, presidential power, government functions, political parties, the United Nations, and methods of changing laws is measured in chapter five. The final chapter discusses political education in the schools. Findings indicate that course work in civics is an important factor in student performance and interest.

It focuses on how community leaders can apply the broad principle of justice to problems of security, reciprocity, and fellowship that face most neighborhoods today. The course is intended for use by community leaders in building community action organizations. Each unit presents essays, suggestions for further reading, and discussion questions. The first unit defines different types of communities, presents theoretical observations on community, and identifies major problems of urban neighborhoods. The second unit explores security through discussion of crime in Philadelphia, followed by a discussion of the relationship between reciprocity, privatism, and public policy in  Unit three. The fourth unit presents essays on the value of community and religious fellowship. An examination of the importance of justice is presented in Units five through eight. Background material on the relevance of justice, traditions of justice, and social and corporate justice is followed by investigation of the relationship between justice, security, individual/community interests, and fellowship. Topics include child neglect, social class, neighborhood crime, ideal justice, criminal rehabilitation, economic conditions, cooperative self-help, and conflict resolution. A social contract technique for establishing political communities is described and an outline of sessions for discussing the eight units is presented. (Author/DB)",

        "author":["Thorsell, Bernard Alan"],
        "description":"Ambiguity concerning the professional value of the master's degree for graduate students in sociology is discussed. Four factors are identified as contributing to this ambiguity: (1) the lack of uniform standards and requirements for the degree in American higher education; (2) the decline in the prestige of the degree in academic circles; (3) the degree is more often linked to professional practice than to academic scholarship; and (4) the degree has become the weakest in the most highly rated and prestigious institutions. Results of a survey of 98 departments of sociology indicate departmental agreement that the master's degree program serves as a method of evaluating student capacity for successfully completing the doctoral program and as an opportunity for the student to  acquire research experience prior to undertaking the dissertation. All departments indicated willingness to accept transfer candidates for their doctoral programs, although varying amounts of course credit are given for previous work. Two changes in the present system are proposed. First, the substitution of a piece of publishable sociological research in lieu of formal requirements for the master's degree. Second, development of terminal professional master's programs in areas of applied sociology. References are included. (Author/DB)",

Initially, the article suggests well-known resources such as various professional and reference publications, audiovisual aids, and computer-assisted instruction. One resource not frequently thought of includes people such as administrators, colleagues, and students. Administrators can encourage mandatory evaluations by students of instructors, colleagues can collaborate in team teaching or serve as outside examiners, and advanced students can serve as instructors to slower students. Another resource includes ideas drawn from sociology: flexibility of the learning environment, role of inquiry in teaching as well as research, and effect of student interest on course success.  Teacher-developed materials comprise the final group of resources. Such materials should be directed toward operationally stated objectives, include means for evaluating their achievement, articulate with theory and methods, extend and apply sociological insights, and include carefully selected test items.

        "description":"Major changes in European and Russian geography instruction primarily at the secondary level are reviewed and implications of these changes for American geographic education are suggested. The information on European and Russian education, taken from papers presented at the 1976 International Geographical Union meetings in the Soviet Union, indicates that changes in European geography instruction are widespread and are due mainly to three stimuli. First, the perception of the discipline of geography is changing. For example, Britain and West Germany are moving secondary school geography more towards the social sciences. Specific curriculum changes in eastern Europe are less clear, but a general interest is expressed toward modernizing geography teaching and stressing  environmental education. The second stimulus is the increasing attempt of geographic educators to meet social demands such as orienting students towards particular ideologies, preparing them for employment, and dealing with social change and cultural diversity. The third stimulus for change is the integration of modern educational theories and practices such as problem solving, decision making, analysis, synthesis, and program evaluation into the geography curriculum. Suggestions for improving American geographic education include involving teachers in the process of change, diversifying curriculum materials, and preparing geographers for employment in business and government.

The guide is based on the idea that affective learning is essential and that the best learning experiences are those in which the affective element is planned. The guide begins with a learning model showing the necessity of personal awareness and a positive self-image. An inventory allows the teacher to evaluate himself in terms of affective qualities, and a bibliography of nine books about the teacher's role is provided. A large section of the guide contains over 35 suggested classroom procedures for improving the affective climate, and approximately 40 classroom  activities with stated objectives. These involve values clarification, development of creative thinking skills, and acceptance of others' opinions. A model for professional development planning suggests and describes over 50 activities including in-service evaluation. Twenty instruments for assessing affect are reproduced with permission to copy from the guide. They include student self-report inventories, teacher and administrator inventories, and general instruments for students, parents, and teachers. An annotated bibliography is included of 66 books about in-service training, method and techniques, and theories of affective learning. (AV)",

The first section describes 25 activities to help students build global perspectives in terms of cultural awareness, awareness of global interdependence, understanding of the overlapping nature of world problems, understanding the reciprocal roles of the world and the United States, and understanding the need to question and evaluate written and oral statements. Section two suggests 30 activities to help incorporate  cognitive knowledge into a global perspective. These involve use of computers, local ecological studies, personal food intake records, map study, and statistical tables. Content areas in which these activities can be performed include economics, history, geography, mathematics, science, and foreign countries.

        "description":"This research paper investigates the manner in which academic perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes of university students can be differentiated on the basis of students' sociopolitical identifications. Four specific hypotheses about politically liberal versus conservative students are examined: (1) liberal students will express greater demands for student participation in the university governance process, (2) liberal students will manifest greater feelings of academic alienation, (3) liberal students will offer more critical evaluations of the university academic environment, and (4) liberal students will perceive greater ideal-real discrepancies in evaluating university goals and characteristics. Survey data were collected from 460 students enrolled at Southern Illinois  University in May 1973. Both bivariate correlational analysis and multiple discriminant analysis of the data were employed. Relatively strong support is provided for all four hypotheses. Furthermore, using composite indicators, it is established that the four dimensions of student reaction to the university exhibit moderate levels of constraint and, thus, constitute a rudimentary academic belief system. The findings are discussed within the context of the university as a quasi-political system. Six data tables, attitude scales used in the survey, and an extensive reference list are included.

The purpose of the study was to ascertain the nature of social problems courses and to determine if such courses are appropriate as undergraduate \"first courses\" instead of traditional introductory sociology courses. Four social problems most frequently cited in texts are poverty, social stratification, crime, and violence. Twenty-three fairly common additional topics are identified. Most texts represent social problems current to the time of publication. An examination of texts in terms of client-centeredness, scope, and specialization reveals that they are strongest in the area of client-centeredness, meaning  they prepare students for post-college employment, develop skilled human resources, and stress action orientation toward solving theoretical problems. Social problems course outlines are found to reflect the same learning outcomes as traditional introductory courses. One problem is that students with high school sociology backgrounds usually have been taught social problems with an action orientation, and introductory college courses have difficulty teaching them the methodology of scientific investigation. The author sees a need to develop students' skills of analysis, interpretation, and systemic investigation. Mere presentation of social problems is not an adequate teaching strategy. (Author/AV)",

The program was begun in the 1972-73 school year at Woodson High School, Washington, D.C. The program purpose was to provide interdisciplinary academic and cultural experiences to students in grades 10-12 in art, music, history, literature, and social studies. The addendum provides lists of program activities and participants, which were not available at the writing of the final report in 1976. Data indicate that Humanistic Studies students and teachers participated in 14 field trips, eight experts in Humanistic Studies were utilized, curriculum aids and bibliographies were formulated, curriculum development workshops and staff meetings were held regularly  throughout the Project year, and the majority of the Project staff have been involved in the Program for three years. Tables, charts, descriptions of field trips, and student responses to a 21-item questionnaire comprise the bulk of the addendum. Four factors were identified by the staff as necessary for continued effectiveness of the Program. These include careful screening of talented students in other schools, adequate funding, ongoing workshops, and expansion of the Program to the junior high level. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"Second in a series of guides to help college and high school teachers incorporate information about Inner Asia into their courses, this pamphlet discusses the role of Tibet in Inner Asia. Aspects of Tibetan political and religious history are highlighted, and comments are made about the formative relationships Tibet had with her neighbors. Chapter one briefly discusses the Tibetan people. They exhibit two cephalic types, their language shows a dichotomy of linguistic origin, and there is a disparity between orthography and pronunciation of many words. Chapters two through nine review the history of Tibet from prehistoric times to the present. Legendary accounts about the origins of Tibetans are summarized. The original seventh century A.D. monarchy is described, and conversion  from shamanism to Buddhism is documented. Invasions by the Mongols began in the Middle Ages, and subsequent political divisions of Tibet ensued. Sectarianism developed in Tibetan Buddhism in the 11th century, and the politically useful concept of reincarnation of lamas surfaced in the 14th century. Beginning in the 17th century, Tibet experienced political domination by the Manchu Emperor of China, Nepal, Britain, and China. Today, Tibet is regarded as an autonomous region of the People's Republic of China. Chapter ten is a selective, annotated bibliography of five books. (AV)",

        "description":"This pamphlet is the third in a series of guides developed to help college and high school teachers incorporate information about Inner Asia into their courses. A discussion of the diplomatic tradition of Inner Asia is presented. The author documents a strong political tradition that made possession of the Orkhon valley in the steppe region necessary for imperial leadership. Inner Asian imperial clans acquired the valley through a confederation process, convinced the neighboring Chinese that the clans were a threat, and tried to live in urban luxury by offering China peace in exchange for civilized goods. Common soldiers and lesser clans frequently forced changes in the imperial leadership that brought benefits of the diplomatic policy to new groups. The author believes this  policy of diplomacy toward China provides a unifying theme for the study of Inner Asia and helps dispel the stereotype of the savage, nomadic barbarians of Inner Asia. A bibliographic note cites several books which describe eighth century A.D. Chinese political policy toward the steppe clans, and 13th century living conditions in the Mongol capital. (Author/AV)",

Ninety-two teachers participated in the survey, for which a special questionnaire was developed. The questionnaire was designed to obtain information on teacher background, definition and preference of the terms values and valuing, agreement or disagreement with ten statements representing possible teaching strategies about values, and identification of significant researchers such as Kohlberg, Simon, Shaftel, and Olsen and Parsley. Results indicate that  respondents have little knowledge of currently well-developed conceptual approaches to teaching valuing and of the names of theorists working in the area of values education with the exception of values clarification. However, 79% believe children should be taught values; 84% believe children should have knowledge of a valuing process; and 92% believe children should be helped to clarify values. One limitation of the study was the emphasis on memorized facts in the questionnaire. That aspect may not have allowed respondents to indicate knowledge of methodology in the field of values education. The questionnaire is included as an appendix. (Author/AV)",

        "description":"This paper was prepared to advise the Teacher Corps/Washington Management Team about the 1976 National Conference. The following questions were used to organize the body of the report: (1) Why a conference? (2) Why certain sessions? (3) Why certain participants? (4) Why certain presentors? and (5) What imperatives should direct planning and design? In answer to the first question, it is suggested that the Conference program be clear in focus, be accountable to a stated purpose, and be supportive of the needs of the persons involved in the Conference. In response to the second question, a conference activity sequence is proposed that allows presentors to have a more precise notion of expectations about what they are asked to do and why, and allows participants to know where they  are in a discrete process and have a better idea of where and when to schedule social and recreational activity to enhance learning. Discussion of the third question reports that the relation of audience of the Conference to actual program offerings is not clear to the participants or the presentors and that the basis for inclusion or exclusion of content or persons is also unclear. Who is to be served and in what way is the question individuals, presentors, and projects need clearer signals about. The answer to the fourth question is that the choice of presentor should follow from what Teacher Corps determines participants should learn and what participants are told they will learn. In reply to question five, nine suggestions are presented for planning and design. (MM)",

The inservice program should be based on a philosophy that has been approved by the district and that indicates the relationship between preservice and inservice education and recognizes means of assessing individual and group strengths and weaknesses. (3) Purposes and Goals. A major goal should be the acquisition of competencies needed to cope with professional tasks more successfully. (4) Design. The program should provide a wide variety of opportunities for personnel  to meet individual and group training needs, should be cooperatively designed by the individual and the designated training personnel, should provide opportunities for individuals to identify their needs and develop appropriate programs in response to these needs, and the school district should have the resources to provide adequate professional training in the program. (5) Criteria for Assessing Needs. The program should provide for an objective assessment of individual and group needs and arrange these according to priorities for the long and the short term. (6) Administration. The system should indicate the role and responsibility of each participant in the development of individual programs, should provide a timetable showing the schedule for individual and group activities, and  should reflect the systematic and continuous nature of professional development.

As its name suggests, simulation is anything that recreates reality. A game, on the other hand, is an activity in which (1) participants agree to abide by a set of expectations in order to create an experience and (2) inefficient means of reaching goals are frequently incorporated into the rules. Thus, participants in a simulation game are thrust into an environment that is governed by rules and operates in a manner similar to the way in which the real world operates. As a way of individualizing instruction, simulation gaming offers an exciting alternative for social studies teachers: (1) During a simulation game learning is self-motivated, self-directing and  self-rewarding; (2) Simulation gaming provides an environment that is capable of adapting itself to the needs of individual students; (3) By emphasizing the debriefing process, simulation gaming provides an opportunity for the experience of the game to be perceived and expressed in a variety of ways by a wide range of distinctively different people.

Also studied were the types of programs and reading materials used by teachers, prime radio listening and television viewing times, proportion of professional readings to total readings, and the types of reading materials available to teachers. Seven conclusions were drawn from a survey of teachers: (1) Television ranks first in utilization, reading second, and radio third, both in general utilization and utilization  with an education emphasis; (2) Prime radio listening time is early morning and television viewing time, early evening; (3) In radio, television, and reading, teachers utilize general type programs more than those of an educational nature; (4) In educational readings, teachers prefer general readings to research readings; (5) Teachers with greater amount of education read more educational literature; (6) Teachers with elementary preparation listened to more educational radio and viewed more television, both general and educational, than did those with secondary preparation. Those with secondary preparation did most general reading; (7) Teachers with fewer years of teaching experience view more general television, and the more experienced teachers utilize more educational radio,  educational television, and professional readings.

        "author":["Perry, Constance M."],
        "description":"In order to improve the quality of classroom discussion, Group Interaction Analysis (GIA) is suggested as a means of increasing an individual's awareness of the role he assumes in group discussions. GIA is a systemized technique involving the observation of both beneficial and non-beneficial discussion activities. These activities are: (1) fact stating; (2) questioning; (3) offering opinions; (4) accepting; (5) disagreeing; (6) summarizing; (7) leading; (8) holding; (9) jumping in to fill a void; (10) interrupting; (11) all talking at once; and (12) silence. The GIA technique can be used in two ways. For the first, each group member can be assigned a number by the observer and listed on a grid opposite the above twelve categories. At ten-second intervals, a check is made  according to which group member is speaking and what category his speech fits into. At the finish, the total interaction during the discussion is recorded. Each group member may thus be made aware of what his role in the discussion was and the group can see the course of the entire discussion. The second use for the GIA is applicable if the leader of the discussion wishes to analyze his interaction in comparison to the rest of the group. The leader is assigned number one and all other members are grouped as number two. This method clearly shows if the discussion is dominated by the leader. The value of GIA lies in making participants aware of what interaction has occurred. It is then up to participants to examine the analysis and, if not satisfied, work toward change. (MM)",

This Center Coordinator Evaluation Form, presented in the paper, consists of a single sheet, varying for each of the three groups responding--student teachers, cooperating teachers, and public school administrators. The items are  printed on mark-sensitive paper with open-ended questions on the back. A Likert-type scale is used for the response options. Each individual supervisor receives a computer printout of the results. A computer printout of the combined data of the program is also provided.

These centers grew out of a general dissatisfaction on the part of classroom teachers with existing inservice programs. It was the feeling that certain priorities for teachers were being overlooked, such as methods of dealing with learning difficulties, class organization, developing curriculum, using space wisely, finding new teaching materials and, in general, handling the day-to-day functions of the classroom. Out of these dissatisfactions the English teacher centers gradually took shape. Teachers felt the need to meet as equals for intellectual cross-fertilization, exchange of ideas and practices, and social relaxation. The English teacher center is a flexible and relaxed place where there is an  easy flow of new ideas. Emphasis is placed on helping and supporting new teachers who are just beginning their classroom experience. The center has become, in effect, a special assisting branch of inservice education.

Academic variables seem to be the determining factor in both application and selection. But both academic and personality factors are positively related to proctor success, based on the use of average gain quotient as the effectiveness criterion. Flexibility, a sense of personal adequacy, the ability to cope with test-taking anxiety, and comfortableness in interactions with peers of both sexes seem to be useful criteria in the selection of proctors.

A programmed course was written to develop competencies related to behavioral goal-setting. Four open-school teachers from each grade-cluster (1-4, 5-8, 9-12) were randomly assigned to two groups. Each teacher interviewed and established two goals and measures with three randomly selected students. After the experimental group completed the instructional program, both groups again interviewed three randomly selected students. The goals and measures were then independently rated by two judges. A review of mean scores indicated that while the pretest performance of the two groups was essentially the same, the posttest performance favored the experimental group. Analysis of  individual scores indicated that each experimental teacher increased the number of measurable objectives elicited by two or more over the pretest; the largest gain of any control group teacher was an increase of one measurable objective.

The concern is to investigate under what conditions multidisciplinarity flourishes. The data base is a long-term, intensive case study of the Learning Research and Development Center (LRDC) of the University of Pittsburgh since its inception in 1963. Several aspects of the LRDC experience offer themselves as suggestions to others who would seek to construct a multidisciplinary organization. (1) In an environment that contains members of several professions or academic backgrounds, certain safeguards are required for those of &quot;less scientific&quot; fields. (2) There should be frequent attempts at communication among all groups. (3) Joint work is one of the best paths to  multidisciplinarity. (4) Certain kinds of professionals and/or certain times in professional careers seem to lend themselves more easily to a multidisciplinary endeavor. (5) Ideal-type roles that embody characteristics of several disciplines can be encouraged as a prototype for the entire environment. (6) Certain organizational characteristics facilitate multidisciplinarity such as placing all groups on the same level in terms of the authority heirarchy or the sharing of personnel and other resources. (7) The multidisciplinary center and the department or school to which a faculty member also belongs must both participate actively in evaluations and decisions regarding promotions or pay raises. (8) Finally, it is necessary that a stable environment be encouraged that provides time and  other resources for multidisciplinary knowledge production. (MM)",

Participants included 209 student teachers, 131 classroom teachers, and 27 university teacher trainers. Student teachers were ranked according to their teaching effectiveness by their supervising teachers, their university methods instructors and supervisors, their fellow student teachers, and by a self-rating procedure. Fourteen of fifteen correlations among the various effectiveness rankings were positive and statistically significant at the .01 level. The remaining correlation was positive and significant at the .04 level. Student teachers ranked as the most effective professionally  tended to be the most satisfied with their field-based teacher preparation program. Student teacher satisfaction with their training program was measured through use of the Purdue Student Teacher Opinionaire (PSTO). Supervising teachers expressed their perception of student teacher satisfaction by completing a Modified PSTO. There was considerable congruence between student teacher expressed satisfaction and teacher perception of the degree of student teacher satisfaction. (Author/MM)",

        "description":"The author of this document found through independent research that many language arts teachers had background information in the area of integrated programs but were largely unable to follow through in constructing and implementing such a program. In order to both increase background knowledge and aid in developing methods of application, the author conducted a summer workshop, meeting four hours per day for five and one-half weeks at a local middle school, using instruments that revealed to the individual teacher the extent of background knowledge and the strengths and weaknesses of prior professional experience. Following the use of the test, a one-to-one conference was held to reach decisions regarding the teacher's needs, and learning objectives were determined. Each session  began with a group meeting (discussion study material) and lectures and demonstrations. Following a coffee and shoptalk break, each teacher worked individually or in small groups while the professor talked individually with each participant. Outside resource persons and off-site work were also utilized. Class participation in a state-level conference on teaching language arts was attended as a professional improvement project. Summative conferences were held with each participating teacher, during which techniques for implementing materials and curricula prepared during the workshop were discussed. The final day of the workshop consisted of a share-and-borrow exhibit, in which participants studied each other's completed work and implementation plans. Although no hard data on the effects  of the workshop exist, changes in background information level and evidence of actual successful application of that knowledge in middle grade/middle school level classrooms do indicate that the workshop was successful in meeting its objectives.

        "description":"This paper details an effort at the graduate inservice level to utilize schools and school settings as a base for theory building and conceptual growth for the individual teacher. Three basic assumptions support this effort. First, the position is taken that the most effective educational program for children is one that grows out of and is guided by the children's needs and interests as expressed through children's own activity. Second, the teacher's primary role is that of analytical, ongoing responding based on the children's own decisions and choices about learning. And third, teacher analytical responses of the type desired are influenced by the teacher's conceptual frame of reference and by how the teacher thinks about educational purpose. Three class elements are then  identified as effective in promoting teachers' conceptual growth: constants, themes, and purposes. Constants establish the educational setting; themes bring focus to the knowledge/substance of the course; while the processes bring about the conceptual growth. The notion is advanced that it is possible to design learning settings that promote conceptual growth in teachers using these three elements, and that these learning settings are not unlike those that are effective for children.

Objectives of the program were to determine first-year teacher common and specific needs for skills and knowledge and to fulfill those needs. Needs were determined through the use of questionnaires; pretests and posttests were administered to determine the initial status and progress of each participating teacher; mid-program interviews and summative questionnaires were used to identify effective strategies for personnel support. In a first-year evaluation, the performance of the control  group in respect to student attitudes, student achievement, overall teacher attitudes, and teacher competency did not vary significantly when compared to data received from a non-support group of first-year teachers. However, a more direct relationship between student attitudes and teacher competence, and student attitudes and teacher attitudes, existed for the experimental group than for the control group. Data from the second year showed significantly higher levels for teacher attitudes and principal rating of teacher competencies for the experimental group. Again, no significant differences were observed in the academic achievement level and attitudes of students of control and experimental groups. Despite some program shortcomings, the project demonstrated that the local school  systems, the State Department of Education, and institutions of higher education can work together and that the cooperative effort can result in a positive difference in the behavior of the teachers.

There is little doubt that opposing claims attempt to oversimplify what is in fact a complex situation. The development of two distinct schools of thought respectively supporting, and opposing, the use of behavioral objectives has tended to encourage such oversimplification. An alternative approach is required, and it is suggested that this should be one that treats behavioral objectives simply as one of several tools available to educators.  Research has already helped to identify some of the advantages and limitations of behavioral objectives, and should be directed towards determining the conditions under which they can be used most effectively. It would then be the responsibility of individual educators to determine whether or not the tool is likely to be useful in their own particular situation. (Author/MB)",

        "description":"This study investigated the effect of locale, grade, and subject on instructional quality. Rural and urban teachers were observed teaching grades 4, 5, and 6 in social studies, mathematics, and language arts. It was hypothesized that teacher verbal behavior in a classroom predicated the quality and quantity of cognitive behavior of pupils. Rural teachers were observed to produce more \"seek\" and significantly fewer \"reject\" verbalizations than the urban teachers; they provided more productive critical thinking on the part of their pupils and rejected few pupil utterances. The structure and nature of the curriculum seemed to determine, in part, the kind of verbal interaction that took place in the classroom. Mathematics teachers asked more questions and provided more corrective  feedback than social studies teachers. Social studies teachers provided more information directly than did the mathematics teachers. Language arts teachers evoked from their pupils more independent thinking with less emphasis on acquiring specific knowledge of facts. A variation was observed in the verbal behavior of teachers dealing with pupils at different grade levels. The results of this study are discussed in terms of contemporary emphasis in preservice and inservice teacher training practices. (JD)",

One hypothesis was that instructional objectives can provide organization to learning materials. In this respect, objectives would provide little help when accompanying highly structured learning materials where the organization of the subject is already evident but would facilitate learning when accompanying less structured materials. The second hypothesis was that instructional objectives provide direction for the learning effort, focusing the learner's attention on the important aspects of the learning task and detracting his attention from incidental parts. The orienting function was tested by withholding in the learning situation  some of the objectives related to a given set of materials and then, later on, comparing relevant learning and incidental learning on a recall test. The organizing function was tested by presenting a full set of objectives to one group and withholding these objectives from another group; one half of the learners in each group received highly structured materials while the other half received unstructured materials. The organizing function would be supported only if the results of the recall test indicated that the objectives had facilitated learning in the case of the unstructured materials group. Results provided empirical support for the orienting function. No support was provided for the organizing function. (MM)",

The study involved a questionnaire sent to all participants of the three groups that could be located. The questionnaire was designed to elicit responses on how the participants feel their student teaching program has contributed to their career.

Various positive and negative aspects of this phase of communication in the classroom are explored. A classroom teacher is observed closely by students every day, and her/his attitude, feelings, mood or state of mind, communicated nonverbally, are interpreted and reacted to by the class. Positive feelings, such as enthusiasm, happiness, and interest are conveyed easily by the teacher's posture, facial expressions and movements. A teacher's concern for, and acceptance of, students can create a classroom atmosphere that will encourage similar positive feelings in students. Negative attitudes, prejudices, and biases are also clearly disclosed nonverbally.  Teachers, also, read the nonverbal communications coming from students. Comprehension, understanding, interest, and involvement as opposed to puzzlement, misunderstanding, boredom, and withdrawal can have an extremely important influence upon the teacher's decisions in regard to possible changes in strategy in presenting classroom material. Nonverbal behaviors indicating possible disciplinary problems arising can be clearly read by a teacher. Fully comprehending the effect of both verbal and nonverbal behavior upon the quality of learning that occurs in the classroom enables a teacher to promote a desirable teaching-learning process and closer teacher-student relationships.

It was postulated that through small group and individual activities an individual may display his/her best cognitive style of learning and that groups composed of individuals of differing cognitive styles may prefer to work on different types of tasks--individuals who are \"field independent\" can impose their own structure or strategy upon a task while individuals who are \"field dependent\" require more explicit directions concerning the dimensions and outcomes of the task from the teacher. It was hypothesized that student achievement will increase if a group  composed of field dependent students is given explicit direction or if a field independent student is added to the group to help structure the task. Data indicate that: (1) field independent students did not differ in group versus individual achievement; (2) groups composed of both cognitive styles achieved more than those same persons acting alone; and (3) group and structured conditions were preferred by all subjects.

Ethnographic data on student teachers indicates that classrooms are characterized by multidimensionality, simultaneity, and unpredictability. Teachers, in turn, developed strategies, such as chunking, differentiation, overlap, timing, and rapid judgment, to reduce the complexity of these demands. This ecological interpretation suggests that the classroom environment engendered specific teacher response patterns and that environmental demands influence skill utilization in classroom settings.

The scope of education KPU is discussed in terms of social policy areas relevant to education and activities relevant to KPU. The conceptual framework developed is used to formulate decision rules for determining whether or not a particular program should be included as education KPU. These decision rules are then applied to the NAS data base, and education KPU obligations are presented by social policy area for three fiscal years, by agency for three fiscal years, by KPU function for three fiscal years, and by agency and function for FY 1975. This analysis of Federal funding for  education KPU indicates the following: (1) Between fiscal years 1975 and 1977 funding for education KPU is expected to increase by 6%. However, as this figure is less than the rate of inflation, support in real terms will decrease. (2) The majority of education KPU funds is spent on problem-solving activities followed by utilization and knowledge production. (3) The three functions accounting for the majority of educational KPU funds are policy formulation demonstrations, development of materials, and implementation demonstrations. (4) Analysis of KPU function by agency indicates that agencies do in fact emphasize different KPU activities. (5) The Office of Education emphasizes policy implementation demonstrations, miscellaneous demonstrations, and policy formulation demonstrations. (6)  NIE emphasizes policy formulation demonstrations and the development of materials. (7) Agencies outside of HEW primarily support development of materials projects. (MM)",

The subjects were 116 students of introductory educational psychology at the University of Texas, Austin. The students were divided into small groups and exposed to an insight problem solving training procedure for approximately one hour. Following this training, each individual worked on a test booklet containing 11 insight problems for 50 minutes. Four of the groups received experimental training: dual training, visualization training, practice, or  control. Comparision of adjusted scores for all groups indicated that dual training yielded the highest scores. These results lend support to the Gestalt view of insight problems, to the possibility that students can be trained to perform better on such problems, and to the suggestion that it may be necessary to combine practice and instruction to teach generalized skills.

It also examines concerns most frequently raised regarding the advisability of the required changes and presents information and suggestions for evaluating and alleviating these concerns. The overview is based on the premise that compliance with Title IX requirements is not only a legal responsibility but an educational responsibility if physical education programs are to contribute optimally to the lives and development of all students. There are two main sections. The first contains a citation of the provisions of the Title IX regulation related to physical education programs and an overview of the basic  guidelines according to which compliance should be evaluated. The second section focuses upon issues and activities related to the achievement of compliance. These range from regulation-specific activities such as reviewing physical education requirements and course offerings to ensure nondiscrimination, to activities such as training physical education personnel and developing community support for Title IX compliance efforts. The appendixes include a checklist for the evaluation of compliance progress and a listing of several resources for further information. (MM)",

More specifically, the study was designed to evaluate teacher learning outcomes following a workshop design utilizing preinstructional strategies. Hartley and Davies (1976) recently stated that organization is the hallmark of good teaching and that sequencing subject material seems to influence student learning outcomes. This study incorporated preinstructional strategies in teacher inservice health education workshops. Learning outcomes of the 192 participants based on posttest mean scores were significantly enhanced. The investigator suggests that findings in this study lend support to use of  preinstructional strategies with adult learners. (Author)",

        "description":"Individualized health incentive program modules were developed for students having severe physical disabilities. Their needs fell into these categories: lack of function of the involuntary nervous system; paralysis or lack of feeling; bracing or confinement to a wheelchair; muscular weakness; arm and joint immobility; prosthetic limbs; brittle bones; diminutive size; cardiac problems; and bleeding problems. The project resulted in: (1) improvements in test scores on standardized tests of knowledge and behavior; (2) improvements in student attitudes as demonstrated by pre- and post-project questionnaires given to students, parents, and teachers; (3) development of five printed strands of health modules, each individualized according to nine disability categories; (4) consolidation  of background information on each disability as it relates to each strand of health education. This background information is printed in the modules. Aimed at teachers of disabled students, it represents the combined three-year input and experience of faculty, parents, and students. The project concludes that physically disabled students need and benefit from a more extensive health education curriculum, which includes both regular and specialized health concepts, information, and activities.

The inservice portion of the program was developed in part to counteract the uncritical identification of student teachers with their cooperating teachers' methodologies and in part to expose inservice teachers to new methods and theories. Techniques used for these purposes included freshman practical experience in supervision coupled with inservice teacher participation in field-based methods courses, summer institutes, workshops, tours, debates, etc. Evaluation of inservice teachers'  performances in these programs are used to identify good teachers and enlist their services for cooperating teacher positions. The core of the program is a series of preservice professional growth experiences, divided into three phases: (1) a freshman year concentration, &quot;Focusing on Self and Choice of Career,&quot; concerned with developing, through field experiences, an adequate picture of self and role, testing the role concept against reality, and modifying the concept to satisfy the student and benefit society; (2) a sophomore year program, &quot;Exploring the School within the Context of Community,&quot; concerned with identifying the school microcosm and school-community relationships, educational psychology, and a possible future synthesis seminar; (3) methods course blocks in various curricular  groupings (Introductory courses; Language Arts; Math, Social Sciences and Science; Fine Arts; Integrated Interdisciplinary Block; Student Teaching Experience) designed to allow students an opportunity to work at one school for a considerable portion of each school day over a significant period of time.

        "description":"The Teacher Practices Observation Record (TPOR) and the Florida Climate and Control System (FLACCS) were reviewed to determine their appropriateness for measuring teacher competencies defined by teachers in Carroll County, Georgia. The TPOR looks at the way the teacher develops subject matter and thinking processes of pupils through the eyes of Dewey's experimentalism. FLACCS records teacher attempts to modify the behavior of pupils in the classroom, both verbal and nonverbal, scaled from relatively gentle, unobstrusive, noncoersive behaviors to ordering and commanding, and the use of negative affect in the management of behavior. Following the assembly of items into measures for behavioral indicators, by observers, these measures were pooled across observers to create a single  measure for each teacher for each indicator, then indicators were pooled to represent competencies for each teacher for each observation instrument, and finally the data were pooled across the two instruments, FLACCS and TPOR, to create nine competencies as these two instruments reflected the perception of the Carroll County teachers. Two primary results emerged: the competencies often formed linear relations with the gain measures, but they were about as often contrary to expectations as in agreement with them, and the second outcome was the tendency of the competencies to form linear relations, but, in contrast, for the empirical-logical composites to form complex relations with the pupil gain measures.

        "description":"The defining property of an admissible scoring system is that any individual perceives himself as maximizing his expected score by reporting his true subjective distribution. The use of admissible scoring systems as a measure of probabilistic forecasts is becoming increasingly well-known in those cases where the forecast is a discrete distribution over a finite number of alternatives. Most serious forecasts which are made in the real world seem to be forecasts of quantities rather than choices between a finite number of alternatives. In such cases as this, it seems much more natural to ask the forecaster to specify a continuous probability distribution which represents his expectations rather than trying to re-cast a basically continuous process into a discrete one. To construct  an admissible scoring system for a continuous distribution, a collection of possible bets can be postulated on a continuous variable, and an admissible scoring system can be constructed as the net pay-off to a forecaster who takes all bets (and only those bets) which appear favorable on the basis of his reported distribution. Mathematical models for this and alternative systems are presented. (Author/BW)",

The Course Comments Questionnaire (CCQ) and the Personalized Course Analysis (PCA) were developed at the University of Wisconsin, Green Bay to overcome this difficulty. By measuring the students' personal goals and the effectiveness of the course in moving toward these goals another dimension is added to the assessment of both instructional and institutional effectiveness. The CCQ and PCA are also applicable to virtually any kind of higher education experience. This report describes the two instruments and presents supporting data including (1) the results of a factor analysis which shows  self-development as a different dimension from those in the course-centered evaluation instruments; (2) the relationships between student goals; and (3) the integration of student self-development data with institutional assessment.

In light of past arguments the author maintains that the questions surrounding aggregation have been badly posed and that the customary methods of analysis were either incorrect or subject to misinterpretation. Therefore, the majority of studies of educational effects--whether classroom experiments, or evaluations of programs or surveys--have collected and analyzed data in ways that conceal more than they reveal. The established methods have generated false conclusions in many studies. Further, the traditional research strategy which pits substantive hypotheses against a null hypothesis and requires statistical significance of effects can rarely be used in educational  research. Samples large enough to detect strong, but probabilistic effects are likely to be prohibitively costly. (Author/MV)",

A few stimulus words, mostly related to the &quot;black experience,&quot; evoked different association patterns from students at predominantly black and predominantly white colleges, but  most stimulus words yielded similar response patterns from both kinds of college. There was a comparatively high level of &quot;no response&quot; for those stimulus words with a Thorndike-Lorge word frequency count of nine or fewer per million counted words. This most frequently happened at the non-selective colleges, and particularly at the predominantly black non-selective colleges. It was hypothesized that most often this occurred because the student was not acquainted with the word. A number of responses seemed to come from the student having mistaken the stimulus word for one of similar appearance. (Author/RC)",

One of the first jobs for members of the MTP staff was to try to define all the competencies required collectively by all the members of an evaluation team. That definition of skills and knowledge was called the Universe of Evaluation Competencies (UEC). It was recognized that the UEC must be validated by empirical studies, so the Self Assessment of Evaluation Skills (SAES) instrument included herein, was developed. The UEC was divided into ten major sections, each of which represented, in the view of its authors, a  necessary component in the building of an evaluation profession. Skill areas were defined for the ten major sections; further, competencies were specified for each of the skill areas. In July, 1972, representatives from the MTP consortium agencies critiqued the UEC and SAES. Later, consultants worked with the SAES staff in further revision of the SAES. The 234-item instrument which resulted was to be used by practicing evaluators in answering three questions: (1) How competent are you in this skill? (2) How important is this skill to the successful completion of your duties? and (3) How interested are you in performing this skill? The SAES pilot test (including methods and procedures used, results obtained, and conclusions drawn from the results) is also described. (Author/MV)",

Early in the planning process the consortium established the task of developing and implementing a Model Training Program which would satisfy six main conditions: (1) Respond to critical manpower needs in the general area of programmatic educational improvement; (2) Provide experience-based training; (3) Use resources available within the consortium for implementation of the program; (4) Be open-ended and continually responsive  to emergent training needs in educational improvement areas; (5) Be guided by a continuing productive evaluation system; and (6) Be governed and implemented by the total consortium.

        "description":"A major problem inherent in the synthesis of the Model Training Project (MTP) evaluation reports cited herein is the absence of the following: (1) a formal project evaluation design, (2) a set of adequate specifications or standards upon which to assess project activities, (3) concensus among project staff on specific criteria for project evaluation. Consequently, most evaluation efforts were ad hoc, lacking in overall continuity, and based on very general standards for evaluation. These problems were recognized internally by the staff, and were noted in a number of MTP documents. The continuity that did exist was of two types: first, the external review teams had repeat members; second, the external review team findings were followed up to attempt to document project  responsiveness; and third, the quarterly and yearly reports to USOE used a reporting format that summed the project activities chronologically. Thus, although there was some continuity, the lack of an overall evaluation design made the task of compiling a cohesive synthesis impossible. Therefore, this document reports numerous evaluation efforts that are little related to each other, which reflects the conditions of ad hoc evaluation that characterized the MTP. (Author/MV)",

Coursework completed prior to internship experience improved the competence of interns. Generally, adequate information from which to choose an internship position was not available for the majority of interns. The majority of MTP and non-MTP interns felt their internship experiences were positively correlated to their interests. Few interns were exploited during internship experiences. The majority of interns from both populations felt: (1) supervisors usually provided sufficient explanation of duties and were available when needed, (2) they  were able to discuss internship related problems with their direct supervisors, and (3) that the work they completed was of benefit to their supervisors. The majority of MTP and non-MTP interns felt they gained practical knowledge from their internship that will be useful in relation to their career goals, and that the internship experience was the most beneficial aspect of their program of study . MTP interns may have been engaged in more activities that they perceived as being valuable than non-MTP interns. There should be more than one alternative from which to choose an internship position. Internships should be located equally on and off campus. The majority of interns felt at least one internship experience should be required of each Educational Development student.  (Author/MV)",

        "description":"Aggregation, or grouping, is a statistical procedure through which all members of a study within a specified range of scores (usually observed scores) are assigned a common or &quot;group&quot; score (for example, the group mean). The various social science methodology literatures agree on the costs of grouping: not only does one always lose information in grouping, in a wide variety of situations grouping introduces systematic error (bias). For most educational research applications the existing guidelines are probably appropriate. There is however, a class of situations in which grouping (of a particular type) will tend to compensate for errors in the original specification. That is, there are certain situations in which grouping produces a gain. Two special cases in which grouping is  beneficial are discussed. Both cases involve estimations of effects in structural equation models. One case concerns grouping that minimizes (grouped) variation in confounding variables. The second case concerns the effects of grouping on measurement error. The benefits of the second case are less clear than in the first. The mathematical framework for both cases is presented as are areas for further investigation. (JKS)",

One group consisting of seven fifth-grade classes was given imagery instructions in the reading of a short text, while another group read the text in a regular way. Three different outcomes covering different types of learning were registered. As aptitude variables tests of verbal ability and spatial (or imagery) ability were used. The data analysis indicated that for the girls there were differences between the treatment groups among the aptitude variables; the results for the girls had thus to be left aside. A positive effect of imagery instructions was found for boys high both in verbal and imagery ability with respect to the acquisition of simple terms. For other outcomes and  groups of subjects either no effect or a negative effect was found. (Author)",

The study had four main objectives: (1) to identify ways in which public decisionmakers can apply NLS data to key policy issues; (2) to foster the efficient use of a large and expanding longitudinal data base by researchers in numerous disciplines; (3) to recommend certain key studies in advance of foreseeable national problems; and (4) to identify research opportunities that alternative future directions of the NLS would open up. The agenda identified a broad array of policy issues suitable for research with the NLS. Research topics were clustered that involve closely related aspects of behavior into  research domains pertaining to the attainment of economic self-sufficiency, higher education, and the circumstances of personal and family life. The ten high-priority studies singled out were: (1) influence of the secondary school; (2) migration and job search; (3) attitudes and career success; (4) segmented labor markets; (5) evolution of career objectives; (6) nontraditional attendance patterns in postsecondary education; (7) persistence and transition patterns of college parallel students in two-year colleges; (8) development of career aspirations and orientations among young women; (9) consequences of early parenthood; and (10) near-term marital stability.

        "description":"Jensen (1969) proposed a two-factor model of intelligence by which mental abilities can be divided into memory and higher mental processes labeled &quot;Level I&quot; and &quot;Level II&quot; respectively. This study employed statistical methods characteristic of construct validation to examine a battery of memory, intelligence, and achievement tests, seeking evidence of the existence, convergent validity and discriminant validity of the constructs of Level I and Level II intelligence. A principal components factor analysis followed by a promax rotation to oblique simple structure was performed, following Jensen's methodology. To examine the convergent and discriminant validity of each of the constructs, Campbell and Fiske's multitrait-multimethod matrices were constructed. The methods involved were  group vs. individual administration for the first matrix and verbal vs. nonverbal response mode for the second. Each of these analyses was performed first using the entire battery of 15 variables. The nine variables used in the second set of analyses were those judged to be &quot;purer&quot; measures of Level I and Level II intelligence. Rural Caucasian fifth grade children were tested. The first factor analysis using all 15 variables yielded six factors providing little support for the two-factor theory. Using all 15 variables there was little support for either the convergent or discriminant validity of the constructs. The factor analysis using the &quot;purer&quot; measures yielded three factors, again providing little support for the theory. Examination of the multitrait-multimethod matrices provided  little support for the convergent or discriminant validity of the constructs. In conclusion, the study calls into question the existence of the constructs of Level I and Level II intelligence. In particular, there was little support for the existence of Level I intelligence as a coherent psychological trait. (Author/RC)",

The experiment used a counterbalanced experimental design and two traditional control groups. Survey data and objective preferences indicated that students preferred self-grading to proctor-grading. However, students reported that proctor-grading prepared them better for major review exams. Although this belief was not supported by hour exam data from the two counterbalanced groups, results from the traditional control groups indicated that self-grading produced performance that was 10 percentage points lower than proctor-grading. These results are discussed in terms of the use of self-grading procedures in self-paced, individualized courses. (Author)",

The connection between the use of the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) as a standardized test and the admission system was explored, concluding that the role and importance of the GRE as an admission criterion was determined by the type of admission system adopted. The psychometric definitions of test fairness (bias) were also reviewed, noting that there are several conflicting definitions of test fairness and that these closely parallel the types of admission systems currently in use. The validity of the GRE was examined, pointing out that the validity, as with most standardized tests,  varied with the validity criterion used and various other factors. The need for local departmental validity studies was stressed in addition to the need for special studies for minority groups. Of the three major sources of potential bias common to standardized testing, content bias, environmental bias, and utilization bias, the last was noted as bearing most directly on the concern for testing as a barrier to the admission of minority students into educational institutions. The question of testing as a barrier, in the last analysis, rests with the values which dominate the selected selection of admission criteria in general. These criteria, usually selected with an eye to the outcome of an educational process, are perceived as the necessary prerequisite to a successful academic  experience. (Author/RC)",

Second, the practical characteristics of CRTS were studied to determine if it is feasible to use currently available CRTS for large-scale evaluations. A set of criteria for selecting tests for evaluation purposes was devised and used to review 28 CRTS.

This document is a first step in collecting and disseminating general concepts on these activities and how they are related to other activities in the continuum of decisionmaking about government programs. The document is offered for the use of anyone who is evaluating programs and analyzing policy alternatives in the sense of engaging in a careful appraisal of what happened, why it happened, what choices are available for future actions and what the implications are of those choices. It is intended for use by all persons who are concerned with this process whatever the academic discipline or  professional background from which they approach the problem. While addressed primarily to practitioners, it is hoped that this publication will also be a useful reference to those who, as legislators or managers, for example, are interested in the products of evaluation and analysis. The chapters discuss the framework within which these activities are performed and provide both conceptual and practical guidance. The emphasis throughout is not on advanced quantitative techniques, but on essential concepts and basic approaches. (RC)",

Marascuilo and Levin's use of &quot;nesting&quot; is completely idiosyncratic and contrary to well-established usage, thus confusing the student. Proper usage is illustrated. Statistical usage modifies models to fit the reality of the data, just as scientific models are modified to fit the facts. All present scientific models are wrong. We seek gradual improvements so our models come ever closer to the truth, but we recognize them as approximations with a certain margin of error. Similarly in data analysis we search for a simple model that describes the data within the limits of sampling error. Texts and articles reflecting  this approach are cited. Marascuilo and Levin (1976) actually claim that Type IV errors are as important as Type I and Type II errors. They advocate extreme rigidity as a virtue disguising it under the name of &quot;elegance&quot;. The flexibility desired in a good scientist is equally desirable in a good data analyst. (Author)",

The validity of the statistical hypothesis testing of time-series, is, however, dependent upon the proper identification of the underlying stochastic nature of the data. Several types of model misidentifications are examined for some commonly encountered models in the social sciences. Analytic expressions for actual Type I error and power probabilities are derived when the mathematics is tractable; simulation techniques are adopted for the remainder of the cases. Results indicate that model misidentification leads to severe perturbations of the nominal probabilities. (Author)",

USMES is a curricular program designed to develop the problem solving abilities of students attending grades one through eight. The goal of the program is the development of 32 interdisciplinary units engaging the student in long-range investigations of real and practical problems taken from his or her school or community environment. These areas were identified as high priority issues during the first year of a comprehensive program evaluation: actual usage, proof of concept, materials, teacher training, and indirect effects. Once these issues were specified, the evaluators selected the following indicators through  which they would gather the required data: (1) a test especially designed for assessing problem solving abilities; (2) selected subtests of the Stanford Achievement Test; (3) observational scales for classroom activity analyses; (4) questionnaires surveying how the teachers were implementing the USMES program; (5) direct interviews with USMES teachers, principals, district level administrators, and leaders of district resource teams who would train USMES teachers; and (6) on site visits for unstructured observations and interviews to determine the actual patterns of program adoption or adaptation. Following an initial overview, chapters two through six address each issue, one by one. A concluding chapter then summarizes, offers specific conclusions, and makes recommendations for the  future development and implementation of the USMES program. (RC)",

        "description":"In an attempt to explore alternatives to the use of standardized tests, the Maryland Alternative Accountability Pilot Project (MAAPP) was launched to allow each participating school to design and implement an accountability plan which would satisfy the requirements of the Maryland Educational Accountability Act. The MAAPP was evaluated using data gathered from a teacher questionnaire; interviews with selected teachers, parents at selected schools, and participating principals; and summaries by the involved consultants. A large between-school variation on the questionnaire indicated that the teacher reaction to the project was school-specific. The data indicated that all involved generally thought that participation was a valuable experience, and that the results were very useful  in teaching and planning. The teachers expressed some negative feelings about the amount of time and work involved. Implications for future projects are discussed. (Author/MV)",

The problem has stemmed from the lack of a valid and reliable scoring method for the instrument. The instrument was administered to 31 in-service teachers, Grades K-12, randomly selected from a larger group involved in a program of supervision. The data were subjected to factor analysis and subsequent alpha internal reliability estimates. It was found that the Blumberg-Amidon instrument is a two-factor or two-scale measure which may also be interpreted as a one-scale measure, each with a high degree of reliability. The instrument is important and valuable to the study of educational supervision and  its optional scoring methods render it extremely flexible over a wide range of research interests and needs.

The data presented in the paper were from the Mesa Public Schools in Arizona, and were compiled during the 1975-76 school year. Five criterion factors were selected for investigation: (1) third grade Stanford reading scores, (2) third grade criterion reading scores, (3) third grade criterion math scores, (4) fifth grade Stanford math scores, and (5) sixth grade criterion math scores. The criterion reading and math scores were for the Mesa-developed criterion reading and math tests. Other data was then summarized to form eleven demographic factors that could be used to predict the value of these criterion variables for each of the schools for the 1975-76 school year. Through the use of  multiple regression, predicted or expected values were determined for individual schools. These values were then used to compare with the actual scores the school attained. Through the use of multiple regression an individualized predicted value or mean value was determined for each school based on its demographic characteristic. Comparisons of achievement of the school were then made based on its individual characteristics. This method was then contrasted with simple comparisons of a school's achievement with the district mean value and national norm mean. (Author/MV)",

        "description":"The Reading Improvement Through Teacher Education (RITE) project provided in-service training in reading instruction to elementary school teachers, and helped principals and reading coordinators to organize their school reading programs. The project's intended mode of operation was fully implemented. RITE specialists provided service contacts to school personnel, and conducted in-service meetings. Taken together, the RITE objectives depict an ideal reading-instruction situation. Within the framework of these objectives, the RITE specialists have provided a wide variety of services to a large number of teachers. These services were delivered on a needs and interest basis and with varying degrees of intensity. Over the four years of the project's operation, teachers and  administrators in RITE schools appear to have developed greater awareness and interest in reading instruction, as evidenced by their increased requests for service. More formal assessment of the project's degree of success in attaining its objectives is being made through the use of a pre-post design which focuses on new teachers. The results of pre and post classroom observations and pretest and posttest administration of the RITE Case Study indicated that the project's objectives were fully attained. As a result of workshops and intensive on-site help provided to new teachers by the RITE staff, there was evidence of progress toward the development of the entire set of reading-instruction skills, and since the students' reading ability is dependent to a large degree on the skill of the  classroom teacher, the ultimate beneficiaries of the RITE services should be the students served by these teachers.

The context of the observations is the Oregon Department of Education model for educational planning. Much of what is said can also be applied to educational planning and program evaluation at the federal level or in large school systems. For the purposes of this discussion, a social indicator is defined as any statistical time series on a quantitative variable that is measurable and time-referenced. One-shot measures are excluded, as are sequences of qualitative descriptions. Operating from the premise that agencies may be forced to build educational indicators from extant data collections, some of the methodological problems inherent in this approach are discussed. Some possible  solutions are proposed, both short-term and long-term, for measurement issues such as specifications bias, construct validity, and political validity. Possible areas for research and experimentation leading to more ideal sets of educational indicators are described. (RC)",

The mathematical procedure developed involved utilizing computer technology in its implementation. It aimed to facilitate, in part, the management of Individually Guided Education (IGE). Four algorithms were designed, each involving the fitting of a homogenizing procedure within the framework of the administrative constraints of the problem. The algorithm which proved to be most effective was the one  which initially assigned students to groups, matched group sizes with skills, allocated eligible students to these groups to maximize their homogeneity and then applied other administrative constraints. The effectiveness of this algorithm was further assessed by comparing its recommended groupings with teacher generated groupings when both were subject to the same constraints. The computerized procedure produced more homogenous groups than did the teachers and an equivalent number of students were omitted. User perceptions of the efficiency and effectiveness of the procedure were also obtained. It is claimed that the procedure developed warrants further evaluation. (RC)",

The report presents the Local Community Control model as the most effective means to change the school board's typical non responsiveness to the needs of the educationally disadvantaged. In so doing, this paper reviews eight schools boards which have incorporated community control into their structure; three in New York City, three in Washington, one in Boston, and one in Chicago. The positions papers that result from this review are guided by the following four questions: 1) How did the community school board come to be? 2) What are its goals? 3) Is the board representative? 4) Is the board's policy making  private or public? A striking observation that emerges while considering each board's effectiveness, is that staff personality is an important factor. Accomplishments vary from board to board and are generally modest. For instance, all boards reviewed have increased community participation but have failed to reach the masses of parents, except on specific volatile issues. The most significant accomplishment characteristic of all boards is that they have allowed community members to become politically and socially effective in the face of overwhelming odds and limited power.

This program was funded by the Washington State Superintendent of Public Instruction under the Urban, Rural, Racial Disadvantaged Education Program (URRD) and conducted by Educational Consultants, Inc. in Everett, Washington from February 2, through June 30, 1976. The program was for hard core school dropouts, under 19 years of age, not enrolled in any school program, and who met at least one other criteria: failing to score a minimum of 9th grade level on a standardized test, being referred by juvenile court, or being suspended from school. Twenty-five students were enrolled in the project and 65 non-URRD students with similar characteristics were also enrolled The  program contained academic and behavioral components. Students were enrolled for an average of 15.1 weeks, attending classes four hours a day. The average academic growth for the completing students was 4.3 grade levels. This document includes a separate section which reports the results of a follow-up study on the program. Educational Consultants Inc. (ECI), a private educational clinic, conducted this study during October 1976 to determine whether the persons who had been project participants were engaged in constructive activity, or a furthe educational program, or defined as unemployed. The study found 87% of the former project participants employed or pursuing further education after accounting for those who had returned to ECI to complete the project or were confined to their homes  for medical reasons.

It also assessed the effectiveness of various modification procedures upon children's racial attitudes and inter-group behavior at different age levels. A four-stage research design was used. The pre-test stage involved administering three attitude measures (the Katz-Zalk Projective Prejudice Test; the Koslin Social Distance Scale; and the Friendship Questionnaire) in group form to all of the children in the second and fifth grades in two public elementary schools. One was in New York City, and the other was in a nearby suburban community. The city school was about 35% black and the suburban school was 25% black. High scoring white children were given a  series of individually administered behavioral measures in a play session with black and white examiners. In the experimental phase, equal numbers of children at the two age levels were randomly assigned to a number of treatment-conditions or control groups. Two weeks after the experimental phase, the battery of attitude and behavioral indices were again administered, and re-administered again from four to six months later. In addition to age and treatment, race of the examiner was also systematically varied. The major finding of the study was that all experimental subjects (as a combined group) showed less prejudice than did the controls after a short term retest. (Author/AM)",

New York City is found in non-complaince with both Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Among the violations that are cited and discussed are the following: (1) the school system has denied minority teachers full access to employment opportunity through the use of racially discriminatory selection and testing procedures, (2) the school system has assigned teachers, assistant  principals and principals in a manner that has created, confirmed and reinforced the racial and/or ethnic identifiability of the system's schools, (3) the school system has assigned teachers with less experience, lower average salaries and fewer advanced degrees to schools which have higher percentages of minority students, (4) the school system has denied females equal access to positions as principals and assistant principals throughout the system, (5) the school system has provided a lower level of financial support for female athletic coaching programs, and (6) the school system has deprived female teachers of seniority rights and other compensation through failure to eliminate the effects of past discriminatory leave policies.

The letter concerns the results of an investigation concerning discrimination in the New York City public schools. This compliance review is the largest civil rights investigation of a public institution ever undertaken. It was found that the New York City school system violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin; Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits discrimination against physically or mentally  handicapped individuals. Some of the findings of this review are: (1) minorities are receiving lower amounts of local resources for basic education, in poorer quality facilities which have a more limited range of curricula, (2) minorities are segregated in elementary school classrooms and special education classes and are given unequal educational services, (3) students whose primary language is other than English are barred from meaningful participation in education programs, and (4) minority and female students in junior high/intermediate and high schools are channeled to less desirable and more restricted academic, vocational and special programs where they are provided with less effective counseling services.

Data for the study includes a survey of attitudes among advisory committeemen, administrators, faculty, non-academic staff, students participating in the program, and other students; the grade point average of students in the program, the retention of these students, and their test scores. The responses to the attitudinal survey indicate that there is little opposition to having minority students on campus. Most respondents state that they are willing to go  out of their way to see that the black and Indian students are successful on campus. Several pitfalls in interpreting the Concordia experience are discussed. These are criteria for selection, administrative commitment and academic and social atmosphere.

It also examined differences in the effects of schooling among men of varying ages, races, cognitive levels, and parental occupational backgrounds. When cognitive ability and family background were controlled, most high school graduates did not have an advantage over grammar school graduates in early occupational status. The advantage of college graduates over high school graduates in attaining occupational status was substantial. Among men who were similar, the advantage in current  occupational status associated with completing four years of high school was less than one half of the advantage associated with completing four years of college.

If so, what is the extent of that loss? And what are the conditions, in the demography and ecology of the system, as well as in the form of the desegregation policy, which affect the extent of that loss? A segregation index was constructed to aid in answering these questions. The change in the number of white students in a system during a school year was analyzed as a function of change in the segregation index. Other variables were also analyzed. The examination was carried out for all school systems during the period 1968-1973. Detailed examination was given to the 21 largest central city systems. Results show that desegregation  brings about an extensive loss of whites, but this loss differs radically under different conditions. Data were analyzed for 1974 and 1975 for nine cities, among the largest 21, which in a single year at least partially desegregated. The results indicate that the desegregation loss did diminsh after the first desegregation year, but it did not vanish. (Author/JM)",

Law reform organizations participate in activities that have common, underlying themes. For instance, in most cases the lawyers want more of society's goods for the clients. In order to evaluate whether law reform activities are successful or not, five variables of a theory that would explain success in reform group law and reform activities are identified. Among these are the following two: (1) the characteristics of social reform groups, and (2) the distribution of the benefits and costs of social reform group activity. A series of case studies are provided in order to illustrate a different type of social reform legal activity. They  were selected from four principal areas of law reform activity: environmental litigation, consumer issues, civil rights, and welfare. The theory presented predicts where law reform activity on behalf of social reform groups is less likely to be successful. (Author/AM)",

Main and interaction effects of race and sex were examined using questionnaire data gathered in 1972. The initial analysis compared Mississippi results for white males and females with results of three other data sets: 1957 Wisconsin seniors, 1955 \"Explorations in Equality of Opportunity\" (EEO) sophomores, and 1964-65 High School Climate sample of tenth through twelfth graders. A second phase of analysis employing dummy variable regression assessed sex and race interaction with the variables of the model. A separate analysis for each race sex  subsample was presented. Results of the comparison of these data with other data sets showed impressive consistency despite some measurement and sampling differences. The covariance analysis showed both race and sex effects to be consequential with sex effects more pronounced among whites than blacks. The race-sex group analysis showed the model to be more effective in predicting educational and occupational expectations for whites than for blacks. This difference was due primarily to the lesser dependence of expectations on beginning status among blacks than among whites. (Author)",

        "description":"This report contains an evaluation of the Accelerated Education Program at Voorhees College. This college is a small (1016 students), predominantly black (98%) college located in rural South Carolina. The general objectives of this program were to provide a complete, enriched college education to deprived students who would not otherwise go to college, to emphasize recruitment of students from the seven rural counties surrounding Voorhees, and to provide educational experiences for the community. The evaluation is based on the following materials: grant documents, quarterly and final reports, a three day field visit to Voorhees College, and a questionnaire survey sent to forty-nine Voorhees students who were enrolled in the Accelerated Educational Program. Among the findings of  the evaluation are the following: 1) the number of students at Voorhees increased 43% since the project began in 1973, 2) the college is providing a liberal education to some students who do not meet the entrance requirements for state colleges, 3) the college has developed a model career education program with a very successful career placement office, and 4) 60% of the students from the seven rural counties surrounding Voorhees have maintained or improved their grade point average from the first semester they entered the program to their most recent semester at the college. Among the shortcomings of the program are the drop-out rate which has increased considerably in the three years of the program, although about 50% of those who drop out at one time re-enroll later and the low level  of community involvement in the college.

Reading activities were provided for 64 percent of Title I students, math programs for 48 percent, and dropout prevention activities for nine percent. The instructional activities offered were usually conducted in a learning center staffed by a certified teacher and aide. Local Educational Agencies reported that the problems encountered most frequently in administering Title I programs were; delay in announcement of allocation amounts, inadequate Title I funds, limitations imposed by federal and state regulations and guidelines, and, inability to obtain qualified staff. Test data reported by local  districts were analyzed according to a norm-referenced evaluation model. Results showed that most students in programs on a twelve month testing cycle maintained the same level or regressed slightly, while those on a fall-spring testing cycle showed greater than expected gains. A total of 12,475 dropout-prone students were served in Title I programs. Of these, 5.7 percent dropped out, compared to an overall state dropout rate of 1.2 percent. (Author/JM)",

They show the number and percentage of black students and the number and percent of the district's schools at each level of segregation or integration each year. Statistics have been gathered for all fifty states according to five regions: northeast, border, south, mid-west, west. Alaska and Hawaii have been excluded. The detailed  statistical profiles of 204 school districts with more than 20,000 students enrolled permit examination of trends in middle size cities and a number of major suburban and metropolitan school systems as well as the 100 largest systems (the only ones on which DHEW data was previously available).

The subjects are 40 black preschool children between the ages of three years nine months and four years four months, selected from seven day care centers and classified according to social status based on the educational and occupational status of their parents. The overall objectives of the study are to determine preschool behavioral correlates of personality variables which have been identified as having developmental significance in relation to academic achievements of black children, and to ascertain from parental interview and ecological data, major  influences of the home and preschool environments which appear to be correlates and possible antecedents of black preschool behavior. A further major objective is to develop a preschool curriculum relevant to normative developmental behaviors of black children. The purpose of the curriculum is to enhance a more effective transition from the environment of the preschool child to the school environment of the larger society. Included in this report are a review of the recent literature, Year II data analysis and procedures, and an analysis and interpretation of data collected on four-year-old subjects. Summary findings of pilot studies are included and projections for Year III data collection, procedures, and analysis are outlined. (Author/BS)",

        "description":"This background paper provides the basis for evaluation of programs aimed at reforming social welfare programs. It analyzes the effect of current income transfer programs on poor families. Public expenditures for social welfare programs have grown four-fold while at the same time, the percentage of families in poverty has declined by only 30%. This is a result of the types of programs that account for most of the recent growth in the number of poor families and the inadequacies of the measures used to estimate families in poverty. There are three classes of social welfare expenditures; social insurance programs, cash assistance programs, and in-kind programs. In fiscal year 1976, social insurance programs, designed to replace reduced income, accounted for 68% of major government  income-transfer payments. Most of the recent rapid growth has been in in-kind transfers, such as food stamps and medicare. Expenditures for in-kind transfers increased sixteen-fold over the last decade, and cash assistance increased four-fold. The effectiveness of transfer programs varies according to family type, race, age, and region of residence. Detailed statistical tables provide information on the assistance programs described.

These schools were to provide a complete bilingual program for all students who had been identified as needing the program within each school. The pilot schools were also to show school personnel throughout each borough the ways of developing, implementing, and operating the programs. Most of the bilingual educators interviewed were reluctant to make an estimate of how long it would take the program enrollees to develop sufficient English language skills to continue their education in an all-English  class. Most of them favored a maintenance program (maintaining the first language while learning English) throughout the child's school career, rather than a transitional program (transition to an all-English class when English language proficiency permits).

        "description":"The federal mission in educational research from 1868, when the Department of Education was established, to 1954, was to collect statistics. In 1954 the Cooperative Research Act authorized the Commissioner of Education to finance research and demonstrations in education. Outside the Office of Education (OE), the National Science Foundation provided most of the funds in the development of new curricula in science and mathematics. OE extended its research program to include the development portion of educational R and D. In 1963 it established nine federally funded, university based R and D centers and several other regional laboratories. A major breakthrough for educational research and development came in 1965 with the passage of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The  1960s saw a network of new research agencies formed with OE under the Bureau of Research. The National Institute for Education (NIE) was established in 1972 as the major federal educational research agency. While the NIE was established with considerable support from the educational research community, it has had many problems since its inception. The federal role in educational research is more comprehensive, vigorous and supportive than in any other previous era. While federal funding for educational research and development has dramatically, increased, decision-makers have not been convinced that educational research has real value or that it will improve schooling. As a result, educational research efforts for 1976-77 received 2.6 per cent of the federal educational budget while 10  per cent of the defense budget goes to research and the agricultural and health fields spend about 5 per cent of their budgets on research.

This program was designed to improve the reading and mathematics performance of the students in the target population. The program began in September 1975 at three Title I high schools. Participating students were enrolled in the tenth, eleventh and twelfth grades. The 748 students who were at least two years retarded in reading and mathematics entered the program. Pre and post tests, on site observations and visits provided evidence that the proposed program was implemented as planned. (Author/JM)",

The programs are English as a Second language at P.S. 152, and the Early Identification Program at P.S. 139. Both were planned with the participation of the principal, the parents, and the school district staff. The first program was designed to supplement regular instruction in English and reading for children who could not speak English fluently. An ESL teacher provided instruction to these children. The teacher used the audio-lingual method 45 minutes a day in small group sessions with the students. The program at P.S. 139 was designed to prevent reading retardation by early identification of reading problems in children from grades one and two. Students in this program were selected on  the basis of their reading readiness scores in grade one, or their primer or grade one reading scores in grade two. Two paraprofessionals worked with forty first and second grade students under the supervision of a regular reading teacher. A diagnosis of the reading skills needed by each student was made by the coordinating teacher. She then prescribed individual programs to be carried out by the paraprofessionals. This program supplemented regular classroom instruction in reading. Twenty seven first and second graders participated in the program. Findings indicate that all the students enrolled in the program at P.S. 152 did not show substantial gain in their ability to communicate in English as measured by the Language Assessment Battery. First grade children at P.S. 139 made  substantial gains when treated on an individual basis. (Author/AM)",

Each of the eight schools sent its own selected students to the center at least three times a week for a full day. There, the children learned about African or Hispanic culture and participated in reading related activities. Program evaluation consisted of a site visit conducted at the end of the project period, and of an examination of documents related to  program implementation. Although the first evaluation objective called for a 100% sample of all 1200 children in the program, complete pre and post test scores of only 64 children were supplied from one of the eight schools involved. Findings indicate that the 64 children surveyed showed substantial reading growth over the course of the academic year.

        "author":["Patton, Michael Q.",
          "And Others"],
        "description":"Research on the utilizations of evaluations was based on a followup of 20 Federal health program evaluations to assess the degree to which the evaluations had been used and to identify the factors that affected varying degrees of utilization. Interviews were conducted with project officers or people they identified as decisionmakers who would utilize information in the evaluation reports. Two major themes emerged from the study. First, it was found that much of the evaluation literature has considerably overestimated the kind of impact evaluation research is likely to have. Second, the importance of the personal factor in evaluation research, particularly the utilization process, has been considerably underestimated. The two themes are directly linked. The impact of evaluation  research is most often experienced as a reduction in the uncertainty faced by individual decisionmakers as they attempt to deal with the complexity of programing reality. It must be assimilated and fitted into a contextual whole. Energetic and interested people in government can and do use evaluation research, not for making decisions with immediate, concrete, and visible impacts, but in a more subtle, clarifying, reinforcing, and reorienting way. Evaluators, then, might do well to spend less time lamenting their lack of visible impact on major decisions and more of their time providing relevant information to those key persons whose thoughts and actions, to a substantial extent, determine the general direction in the evolutionary process of program development. It is in consciously  working with such decisionmakers to answer their questions that the utilization of evaluation research can be enhanced. (TA)",

        "description":"The project examined the effects of learned leadership/membership skills on performance in task-oriented groups, developed competence-based instructional materials to teach such skills, and examined the effects of such skills on individual and group knowledge, skills, attitudes, and performance. Following a literature review, materials review, and needs assessment, discussions and questionnaires gathered information from teachers, parents, counselors, managers, employers, and students. Specific needs having been established, the curriculum design and prototype modules were developed. Eight priority areas were identified as those to be addressed in the development effort: Group communication, knowing and using resources, evaluation, conflict resolution, planning, coordinating  activities, sharing leaderships, and decisionmaking. Extensive pilot testing over the following two years involved a variety of student settings--urban, suburban, rural; large schools and small; academically motivated students and underachievers; vocational, experimental, and traditional academic classes. Findings indicated that (1) administrators, teachers, and students appreciate the need for and value of instruction in the cooperative group interaction skills area, (2) the skills in this area of competence are difficult to teach, and (3) extended research and development--which would take into consideration further testing, teacher training, curriculum fusion, and curriculum design--would be of significant value. Appendixes contain the curriculum outline, operational definitions of  effects to be tested in task-oriented groups, summary charts of selected evaluation items, and some reflections on and implications of the cooperative group interaction skills (CGIS) curriculum.

        "description":"Five separate national studies describe and analyze government involvement in various continuing education delivery systems in five European countries: Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Norway. The German study traces the historical background of further education in the Federal Republic of Germany, the provisions of the 1974 North Rhine/Westphalia further education law, and the planning procedure for a unit/credit system. In the second paper France's Continuous Vocational Training Act of 1971 is described briefly and an assessment is made of its effects after four years in operation. Focus is on the provision for individual educational leave from work, the involvement of trade union organizations and management, and new trends in State intervention. &quot;Initial Results  of Agreements on Paid Educational Leave in Italy&quot; is the title of the Italian study, which reviews several experimental programs resulting from agreements on paid educational leave for certain categories of workers. Agreements and demands of the unions and response from public authorities are both analyzed. The fourth study traces historical development of adult education within the context of Dutch society and considers the government sponsored endeavor to create an &quot;open school&quot; system. &quot;Self-Management of Adult Learning in Norway&quot; describes some Norwegian experiments based on different degrees of participants' influence and discusses how self-management of learning is integrated into the Government bill on adult education (1976). Focus is on the relationship between the bill and the  work for democracy in industry. (JT)",

This unit enables students to become familiar with the basic metric units, their symbols, and measurement instruments; and to develop a set of mental references for metric values. The metric system of notation also is explained. Unit 2 provides the  metric terms which are used in this occupation and gives experience with occupational measurement tasks. Unit 3 focuses on job-related metric equivalents and their relationships. Unit 4 provides experience with recognizing and using metric instruments and tools in occupational measurement tasks. It also provides experience in comparing metric and customary measurement instruments. Unit 5 is designed to give students practice in converting customary and metric measurements, a skill considered useful during the transition to metric in each occupation. (HD)",

        "description":"From a sample of 15,000 veterans, 6,141 responded to a series of questionnaires developed to gather information to assess the effectiveness of the veterans' education program (authorized by the Veterans' Readjustment Benefits Act of 1966). Responses indicated that generally, a veteran entered training for one of three reasons--to earn a degree, certificate, license, etc., to learn a new skill to obtain a better job, or to improve skills related to his/her current job. While percentages differ significantly depending on the type of training taken, overall, about 40% of the respondents having terminated their GI bill training said they did not achieve their primary training objective. Veterans who took apprentice, other on the job, and graduate level college training said they  achieved their objective most often. Correspondence, vocational/technical, and high school trainees indicated that they achieved their objective least often. While the strength of the relationship varies depending on the type of training, statistical techniques used to analyze veterans' responses indicated for all types of training that there was a definite relationship between the veteran's status as a completer or noncompleter and whether he/she achieved his/her primary goal. Other results are presented for the areas of employment after training, earnings after training, usefulness of training, counseling, and tutorial assistance. The appendix contains an example of one of the questionnaires used in the study. (SH)",

The overall results showed that (1) during this period, a total of 5.3 million persons had enrolled in training under the current GI bill, and of this total, 1.1 million had taken their most recent training by correspondence, and (2) a greater proportion of service personnel who trained have been correspondence trainees; however, because veterans make up the greater part of total trainees, the bulk of correspondence trainees (79%) are veterans. Other findings are presented under the following headings: Completion Rates, Average  Cost, and Most Frequently Used Courses; Factors Influencing Correspondence Training; Costs and Benefits of Correspondence Training; Completion Rate Perspective; Comparison of the Status of Veteran Correspondence Trainees in November 1974 and April 1973; Completion Rate and Cost Effectiveness by Course of Training; Number of Trainees, Completion Percentages, and Cost Effectiveness by Course by School; and Correspondence Schools.

The first section of the manual contains six lessons with student exercises that emphasize good work habits such as the importance of effort, punctuality, neatness, and cooperation through reading, role playing, and discussion. Also included in the job exploratory section are  specific safety precautions which are stressed in lessons on tools. Students are introduced to selling and merchandising, mass production, assembly line, economics of cost, and ecology. The second section, vocational exploratory, pertains to social skill and prevocational development. The six lessons are on safety, blueprint reading, and several assembly projects.

These aspects were the actual labor market conditions in two different urban settings--New York City and the greater Boston area; the specific institutional supports available to ex-addicts and addicts-in-treatment as those supports are perceived by both clients and providers of service; and an analysis, by employers, of the performance and behavior of ex-addicts and addicts-in-treatment once they have secured employment. Surveys were taken to define the practices of drug treatment programs. In addition, a questionnaire was developed to isolate the key employment related issues and practices that  comprise clients' and providers of service' perceptions of the rehabilitative situation. Finally, through the development of a specific relationship with PACT (Provide Addicts Care Today), the job-related behavior of ex-addicts and addicts-in-treatment was assessed. Results indicated that (1) the two urban labor markets examined offer only limited options for meaningful, remunerative, and stable employment, (2) drug treatment programs, despite stated priorities involving preparation for employment, are neither structured, funded, nor staffed to adequately provide concrete employment related services, (3) clients rely more on their own rather limited resources in order to gain employment, and (4) ex-addicts who are hired and retained are rated by employers as above average in performance,  compared to non-addicts.

        "description":"While recent research on why adults participate in continuing education programs does not provide educational planners with any easy prescriptions for programing success, it does suggest some broad directions for more effective program development, particularly in relation to needs assessment, the promotional aspect of marketing, and the design and management of learning activities. The most extensive recent studies of motivational orientation (factor analytic studies using Roger Boshier's Education Participation Scale) yielded a striking degree of similarity in findings. Six factors were identified: Social relationship, external expectation, social welfare, professional advancement, escape/stimulation, and cognitive interest. Further study of relationships between the  motivational factors and participant and program characteristics revealed little correlation. It can be concluded (1) that Cyril Houle's three-factor typology of the adult learner (goal oriented, activity oriented, and learning oriented) can no longer be considered an adequate representation of reality, (2) that major orientation factors appear to be valid only for participants generally, and (3) that most people appear to participate in adult education for mixed reasons, some of which are unrelated to learning per se or to course content. The research should sensitize planners to the variety and complexity of the motives that underlie participation in continuing education. (Implications for program development, broad-scale needs assessment, marketing, and management of learning  environments are discussed.) (JT)",

        "description":"The research reported here examines the role of psychological expectancies as labor market supply characteristics of black and white men and women. Secondary analyses are carried out on data provided by the Survey Research Center 1972 national probability sample of adults 18 years and older drawn for the presidential election study. The report focuses on race and sex differences in previous labor market experiences, the relationship of these past experiences to current employment expectancies and general feelings of efficacy, and finally the effects of both market experiences and expectancies on current behavior. Psychological expectancies are emphasized as the elements of motivation that should have unusual significance for understanding the dynamics of race and sex  discrimination in the labor market. There are five major chapters. Chapter 1 describes the sample and measures used in the analyses reported here. Chapter 2 describes the market experiences, perception of obstacles, and current expectancies of black and white men and women. Chapter 3 examines the interrelationships of these variables with particular focus on the effects of years of schooling and previous market experiences on current expectancies. Chapter 4 presents a general causal model in which expectancies are viewed as intervening influences between current market outcomes and variables at two earlier stages, original educational attainment at stage one and subsequent market experience at stage two. Three types of current market outcomes are analyzed with application of the model to  the job status of blacks and whites, to women's and men's search behavior, and to the work intentions of white housewives. Chapter 5, on implications for counseling and future research, describes the types of expectancy and experience measures and the design that will be needed to extend this line of interdisciplinary labor market research.

The volume begins with a brief history of the model, tracing the project's evolution through the various stages of development and describing major events related to the process of planning, operating, and evaluating the program. The next section describes the major activities and accomplishments of each of the model's five major components: (1) Outreach, which used mass media and other approaches to attract clients, (2) counseling, which provided career  information, guidance, and referral by telephone using paraprofessional counselors, (3) the resource center, which collected and disseminated career-related materials for project staff, clients, and the community, (4) the information unit, which developed special directories and materials which supported the counseling process and could be sent to clients, and (5) research and evaluation, which provided project staff with feedback about the clients and the operation of the program. A third section describes the characteristics of the pilot site in Providence, Rhode Island, and how the project interacted with the community including its role in local adaptation after the research and development phase. The final section discusses the project's efforts to share its experiences and findings  with potential adaptors of the model and other interested persons outside Rhode Island.

        "description":"The objective of this study was to develop an economic approach to the forecasting of allied health manpower in markets in the State of California. The health manpower categories considered included: (1) Medical technology, (2) occupational therapy, (3) dietetic and nutritional services, (4) physical therapy, (5) health administration, (6) environmental health, and (7) speech pathology and audiology. Four projection techniques were applied to the seven selected health-related fields. The first was a basic population ratio approach, the second a modified ratio approach that brings in a limited number of other factors affecting demand, the third an econometric approach that assumes equilibrium between supply and demand, and the fourth an econometric approach that assumes  disequilibrium between supply and demand. A committee of economists from California State Universities and Colleges served in an advisory capacity to the project, and it was the consensus that the general approach used was methodologically sound. The study was limited to using existing sources of data, which differed in their completeness for the various fields. The forecasts developed are useful for curriculum planning, faculty staffing, and career development. An overriding theme resulting from the empirical work is that these allied health manpower markets are heterogeneous, i.e., variables significant in one market were found not to be significant in another. The most significant issue that became apparent was the need for data of high quality. While the basic and modified ratio  approaches are easily programed for staff use, the general conclusion is that the econometric approach with markets in equilibrium is the most viable. The report includes summary of the literature review, lists of data needs, and future research suggestions. (WL)",

        "description":"A survey questionnaire was mailed to all active Peace Corps Volunteers (PCVs) in the summer of 1975. Based on an internal analysis of the 3,479 respondents (a 66% return), the following findings represent the manner in which PCVs perceive their volunteer experience. Perceived volunteer accomplishments and morale are very high. Volunteers believe they are generally achieving the three Peace Corps goals. Volunteer assessment of four specific program areas (recruitment, training, program development, and program implementation) indicates considerable variations, the most serious problem for most volunteers being their relationships with the host country agencies. Results led to the following recommendations: (1) Program for planned positive impact so that jobs are better developed,  sites more carefully chosen, and host country nationals less likely to be replaced, (2) undertake a concerted effort to strengthen the relationship between volunteers and their host country agencies, (3) spend less time providing direct support to volunteers and more time working to be sure that agencies are willing and able to support them, (4) place volunteers only in jobs where adequate supervision by host country agencies is provided and the role of the volunteers clearly understood, (5) provide more specific and accurate preservice information, (6) continue and increase where possible the practice of having trainees live with host country families during training, and (7) carefully review the placement of volunteers who teach English as their primary job. The report includes  country-specific data on volunteer achievement and selected areas of programing. The questionnaire and raw scores are appended. (WL)",

        "description":"Ghana first received Peace Corps assistance in 1961 (the first country in the world to receive volunteers) and since then volunteer strength has fluctuated from between 185 to 415 (presently 179). Secondary education has been the major thrust in programing until recently when Peace Corps/Ghana (PC/G) shifted its emphases to agriculture and rural development. As part of ACTION's annual evaluation process, PC/G program was evaluated during the spring of 1976. A combined method of field and onsite visits was the principal approach used in assessing the relevance, effectiveness, and efficiency of the program. A combination of interview, observation, and data analysis techniques were employed. The basic conclusion of the evaluation team is that while PC/G has made a significant  contribution to the education sector of the country, it is now going through a period of transition which is influencing the effectiveness of the tools it uses to carry out its policies. Positive influences are seen coming from recent additions to the staff. Negative influences on the organizational tools are seen coming from the recent shift in policy from slot-filling to technology transfer programing that is implicit in the shift from secondary education to agricultural and rural development. The evaluation identified problems and made resultant recommendations for their solutions: (1) Exercise continued Peace Corps' presence in Ghana in accordance with current Country management plans, i.e., exercise a policy of gradual phase-down in agriculture and rural development, (2) shift  programing from a slot-filling mode to a skill transfer mode, (3) continue to exercise a policy of collaboration with the international donor agencies, but at the same time explore the absorptive capacities of the host country in ways which are not dependent on the donor agencies, and (4) Peace Corps/Ghana should clarify its programing procedures with U.S. Embassy.

Methodology included an analysis of training and service completion of over 1,600 volunteers, an analysis of costs and cost-effectiveness, an opinion survey of volunteers currently working in agriculture, and field research in 11 Peace Corps countries. Findings indicate the following: ABG's, in general, are effective in that their service record (duration, achievements, etc.) is comparable to other volunteers working in agriculture. They are cost-effective in that their cost per  month of service is the lowest in relation to the other skills used in agriculture. ABG's who are specifically trained to perform well-defined, challenging jobs, who are supported with adequate supplies and equipment, and who are given proper supervision perform effectively in agriculture. It is concluded that there is a supply of ABG's and a demand for trained manpower to develop agriculture; it is the responsibility of the peace Corps to identify the demand which meets the known supply and to program accordingly.

Areas of research and discussion include the following: Work potential and work orientations of welfare persons, impact of WIN (input-output emphasis and process emphasis), altering work incentives, family structure and personal motivation, and policy alternatives in historical perspective. Results presented show that (1) welfare participants want to work, but substantial barriers (including poor health, low skills, need for child care) stand in the way of continuing  labor force participation; (2) WIN has a beneficial effect upon some of those persons who receive services, but it is not clear which aspects of the WIN effort provide these beneficial results; (3) work-for-relief efforts are not cost effective; (4) when public service jobs are provided for welfare recipients, the recipients function very well, according to their work supervisors and self-evaluation; and (5) without provision of more jobs at which heads of households can earn sufficient wages to support their families above the poverty level, WIN can have only a marginal impact on the welfare situation.

        "description":"A project was designed to develop and test (phase I), and implement (phase II) a research design for the study of student attrition in the Wisconsin vocational technical adult education (VTAE) system with the intent of identifying student attrition and determining its predictability. Phase I, the developmental aspect (described in this report), involved identification of attrition and the predictive variables, methods for data collection, data analysis, and report format by a consortium of four Wisconsin technical institutes in fiscal year 1976. The institutes conducted individual attrition studies for their individual schools with the specific objectives of (1) identifying the extent of student attrition categories such as job-outs, transfers, failures, or socioeconomic  withdrawal, (2) identifying background characteristics, ability factors, and self-concepts which predict student attrition, and analyze their effects on attrition, and (3) determining program deficiencies if any and recommendations for changes. Some of the consortium's major conclusions were that information on dropouts is often sketchy and that data which is available is not always reliable; students' reasons for dropping out are often unclear or unable to be verbalized even to the early leaver; much attrition is related to a lack of commitment or motivation on the student's part; student assistance for a change of direction is not readily available once a student is participating in a full-time program, and if it is available, it is not recognized by the student. Twenty-three  recommendations are listed. The nine appendixes, which cover half the document, contain tabular information on student characteristics. (SH)",

(The principle objectives of the project were to bridge the gap between the theoretical and developmental findings of activities sponsored by the Illinois State Division of Vocational and Technical Education (DVTE) and actual implementation of those findings into two K-14 sites; to implement into two sites in Illinois selected research, curriculum, developmental, special, and exemplary activities; to provide an opportunity for a variety of persons, i.e., counselors, administrators, labor and business representatives, to receive  information and visit a demonstration center designed to exemplify proven learning techniques in career and vocational education; to identify the appropriate and practical courses of action that must be taken to ensure successful implementation of future research, development, curriculum, special, and exemplary activities, and to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the demonstration centers.) Major project results and accomplishments are summarized for each of the 15 exemplary activities implemented in Joliet. Other aspects of the project discussed are the manpower/workforce survey, staff development, dissemination and demonstration (17 pages), and evaluation procedures. The conclusions indicate that interest, enthusiasm, support, and involvement for career and occupational  education have increased as documented by local and the third-party evaluations.
