        "description":"This paper deals with two sets of data-one that fails to find any long-term sex differences in adults, and another which seems to find such differences. The Berkeley Guidance Study offers longitudinal data in which no variables differentiate between the two sexes at all age levels. From these results, the authors conclude that the normal course of sex role development involves a gradual acquisition of individual sex role character which continues throughout the years and which is less fixed than usually assumed. A second study on family structure points to sex differences which have impact on family size, birth order, number of children, and spouse characteristics. The authors conclude that sex role research should concentrate less on sex stereotyped and justificatory mythology  of sex role universals and more on specific research pertaining to the age and ecological relevance of the differences that do appear.

Already in use during intake and post-placement, group methods are now proving relevant in the adoptive study of applicant parents and in the improved knowledge and effectiveness of service delivery. In the form of a seminar for applicants, this adoptive study explores the following: (1) emotions; (2) purposes of the adoptive study; (3) the adoption worker; and (4) adoptive parents as distinguished from natural parents. Adoptive study serves a dual purpose: (1) preparation for adoptive parenthood; and (2) evaluation of applicant parents. An appropriate vehicle for attitudinal change, the group discussion method provides an opportunity for applicants to discuss their attitudes with other adoptive parents. The  report includes an outline of the mechanics of group study and an assessment of the relative merits of an individual versus group approach. (Author/LAA)",

Findings suggest that: (1) little difference exists between survey responses of senior and junior high school participants; (2) lack of effective communication between student councils, their constituency, and staff has lead to little understanding regarding meaningful student involvement in decision-making, and to widespread dissatisfaction with present student councils; (3) areas identified as  important by senior and junior high school participants contain substantial overlap; and (4) both students and staff have positive feelings about student participation in decision-making.

This study examines differences in the vocational maturity of women across different levels of internal-external (I-E) control and typical versus atypical vocational choice. The study made the following predictions: (1) internally-controlled women will have a higher vocational maturity score than externally-controlled women; (2) women making atypical vocational choices will have higher vocational maturity scores than those making typical choices; and (3) an interaction between type of choice and perception of control with respect to vocational development will exist. Using Crites' Vocational Development Inventory and MacDonald-Tseng's I-E scale to measure  vocational maturity, the author proposes utilization of the I-E control construct in examining vocational maturity of college women in order to contribute to an understanding of the vocational choice process.

The data used to test this reformulation were drawn from a longitudinal research project on 779 undergraduates. Research variables consisted of occupational status of parents, parents' educational level, family's social class distribution, and occupational-status discrepancies. The results consistently support the resource model, suggesting that persons do take into account family members, other than the father, when they are asked to assess their family's social status.

        "description":"This report, after thoroughly surveying the literature on anxiety, acceptance, and achievement, focuses on the relationship between a child's anxiety, peer acceptance, reading level, and overall school achievement as part of child development. Eight seventh-grade classes served as subjects for the study which examined such variables as age, sex, socioeconomic level, scores on Iowa Tests of Basic Skills, Iowa Silent Reading Test, and Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale with L-scale; and sociometric ratings of peers. Results show that anxiety does not relate significantly with the other variables under examination, with the exception of age. However, peer acceptance does reflect a relationship with school achievement, reading level, sex, and socioeconomic level. The author contends  that since one justification for tracking students consists in freeing the child from the anxiety of competing with academically abler students, the absence of anxiety as a contributing variable supports the abolishment of such homogeneous groups.

The roots contributing to the development of Gestalt therapy as presently practiced are explored briefly. Gestalt theory is presented in a developmental way, initially exploring the relationship between an organism and the environment. The paper also presents some basic guidelines or rules of Gestalt Therapy and some common Gestalt Therapy techniques such as games of dialogue, unfinished business, playing projections, reversing behavior, body movement and expression, the contact withdrawal rhythm, and dream work. Also provided are further resources for use in exploring Gestalt Therapy, including research demonstrating the  effectiveness of Gestalt Therapy in group settings. The author concludes with a reminder that Gestalt Therapy can best be understood through direct experience with Gestalt therapists or people who have learned to follow their personal awareness continuum.

The procedures developed as FICS training were based upon the following assumptions: (1) low-income parents can be trained to train middle-class teachers in communicating effectively with parents and children living in low-income neighborhoods; and (2) more open communication and involvement between school and home would enhance the educational growth of youngsters. The results of this investigation indicate that increased communication and involvement between low-income families and teachers significantly increase children's average  daily attendance and achievement. FICS training may be effective in opening lines of communication and involving low-income parents and teachers in productive dialogue and action, thereby enhancing the educational growth of youngsters.

Results of analyses of variance revealed significant differences in values of children, parents, and school personnel. Children's values significantly reflected positive moral virtues; material success and status; and a humanistic approach to life, religion and family. Parent's values were loaded on  conformity, moral virtues, social relations, and discipline. Values of school personnel were loaded on material success, status, moral virtues, conformity, and social relations. Results suggest that some differences between parents and children were a function of socioeconomic status or ethnic background.

While the therapeutic advantages of these techniques have been demonstrated, there is limited evidence to suggest that systematic procedures have been developed to train people to use these techniques. The proposed discrimination model is based on individualized training procedures that include: operationally defined objectives; a variety of learning activities; criterion-referenced evaluation; established levels of performance; opportunity for remediation; and self-pacing. Discrimination learning involves training the prospective counselor to differentiate behaviors in three areas. The first includes self development or the ability of the trainee to discriminate the potential effects of  his facilitating or interfering behaviors on client behavior. The second area involves developing and expanding trainee's response repertoire of skills, techniques, or counseling strategies. The third area focuses on developing the trainee's ability to discriminate the consequences of his behavior on client behavior. Elaborate training procedures for each area are proposed. Implications for training validity and accountability are discussed. Methodological suggestions for research on training behavioral counselors are presented. (Author)",

        "description":"This study explores the effects of a white, middle and upper-class preference system on the helping relationship. Evaluating people according to their monetary status, educational background, productiveness, and religious and social origins characterized many nursing students in the study. In an attempt to help students become aware of their own prejudices, examine their own value systems, and change their attitudes through understanding and acceptance of values different from their own, the study used exercises from human relations training such as role playing, racial slurs, and sensitivity groups. Following such exercises, subjects showed an increased awareness of the effects of racial prejudice on the helping relationship. (Author/LAA)",

        "description":"The process of assertive training is described with emphasis placed on its applicability to problems in female assertiveness. Male and female members of four assertive training groups were compared on the Wolpe-Lazarus assertive inventory. Male members obtained a significantly lower score than female members i.e., men reported themselves as significantly more assertive than women. Differences in specific areas of assertive behavior emerged between the sexes. Women were less able than men to set limits for themselves or express negative feelings. Men, on the other hand, had difficulty in expressing positive feelings. By focusing on nonverbal behavior, verbal behavior and communication style, autonomic response and cognitive and attitudinal variables, the study used assertive  training to change these patterns of female expression.

The subjects were 60 students who were enrolled in a two-year academic center preparing students for employment in both agriculture and business-related fields. Experimental groups were formed utilizing the following combinations: (1) Skimmer and Novel; (2) Tach-X and Novel; (3) Controlled Reader and Novel; (4) Controlled Reader and Tach-X; (5) Controlled Reader , Novel, and Tach-X; and (6) Controlled Reader, Skimmer, and Novel. After the subjects had been assigned to groups and times had been scheduled, subjects were instructed in the technique to be used in  their group. The groups met four times a week for 55-minute sessions for a period of ten weeks in individual reading rooms prepared for their program. The same teacher and reading aide supervised all phases of the program. The major results indicated: (1) the increase in reading rates over time was significant; (2) the learning combination showing greatest learning progress was the Controlled Reader, Skimmer, and Novel combination; and (3) the increase in reading over time was least significant when the Skimmer or Tach-X was the only instrument used during the first six weeks of instruction.

An evaluation instrument which permitted the tabulation of specific decoding skills was administered as a pretest and posttest measure to a random sample of 50 or more pupils in each primary grade, 1-3. The gains on decoding skills which were evidenced were statistically significant and occurred both among the fast learners and the slow learners within these low reading groups. One of the significant findings was that after less than a year of experimental instruction, all children in the sample acquired the skill of decoding simple three-letter short vowel  words above the 40 percent correct level--a level that indicates the acquisition of transfer skills beyond the sight word level.

A group of 26 sixth graders were the subjects for the project. Some of the behavioral objectives for the sixth grade students in the experimental class for Social Studies included: (1) demonstrate reading comprehension skills at a level of performance expected on the basis of vocabulary development as measured by the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test, (2) demonstrate a level of achievement for vocabulary skills in reading that is significantly above the previous relative standing as measured by the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test, and (3) demonstrate a level of achievement for  comprehension skills which shows a greater gain between pre- and post-testing than that of a control group as measured by the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test. The subjects were instructed with multi-media materials for one hour each day and grouped periodically in interest groups, achievement groups, and study skill groups. The results indicated that the students' skills in reading improved, an independence for using equipment and learning aids was developed, and critical reading skills improved. (WR)",

Educational Development Laboratories (EDL)/McGraw-Hill and AIB, New York Chapter, entered into an agreement in which EDL/McGraw-Hill agreed to provide the teaching staff, curriculum, instructional materials, and specialized equipment needed for trainees to develop skills in reading, communication, mathematics, social studies, and science. The educational objective of this total program was the successful completion by the students of the General Educational Development  Tests (GED). Teachers went through a four-week training program to develop: (1) an understanding of a comprehensive laboratory approach to GED instruction, (2) expertise with media, (3) an understanding of the value of a multimedia approach to educating the disadvantaged, (4) expertise in individualizing instruction, and (5) techniques in critical reading instruction. A total of 485 students were accepted for the program, and 372 completed it. The students in responding to a questionnaire, in general agreed that the program helped them. (WR)",

This research was directed toward stating a terminological approach in operational terms in order to develop and test procedures for acquiring vocabulary by computer. Three phases are described: (1) the construction of a computer program for comparing two acquisition models, (2) the development of a data base (course content) through the use of the above procedures, and (3) the evaluation of the approach and acquisition models in an experimental study. A blocked-presentation model was compared with spaced presentation, the former supported by concept formation studies and the latter by studies in school learning.

The organizer was a 125-word paragraph which provided the reader with a generalized overview of the reading material and focused on conceptual relationships. The subjects were 160 full-time community college freshmen. Four treatment groups were formed: (1) the organizer first, then a reading passage, (2) reading passage first, then the organizer, (3) the organizer first, then the reading passage, and the organizer again, and (4) only the reading passage. No time limit was imposed, and all subjects had the same reading passage. Immediately following the  reading the subjects were given a twenty-question comprehension test which tested recall of facts, main ideas, and inferences. Based on the findings, it appeared that the use of an organizer of the type employed in this study would be beneficial to community college readers in terms of increased comprehension. The findings also indicated that placing the organizer after the passage tends to result in greater comprehension. (WR)",

Two years of activities are discussed--the 1971 summer workshop, evaluation of the first year's program (1971-72), and the 1972 summer workshops. Thirty classroom teachers took part in the one week summer workshop in 1971. This workshop was designed by the State Reading Education Specialist and other educators to prepare teachers to return to their schools and establish inservice programs. A workshop content survey was given, and this data indicated a definite knowledge gain in selected workshop topics. The evaluation of the first year's program reports on the responses of the teachers in the 1971 summer workshop regarding their success in sharing their workshop experiences. The teachers indicated  a statistically significant increase, at the .01 level, in their over-all rating of their school reading program's effectiveness. The final report, for the two 1972 summer workshops, includes an evaluation by the 60 participants based on daily sessions, evaluation checklists, a pre-post workshop content survey, and a workshop summary. The overall evaluation score for both workshops was 9.7 on a 10-point scale. (WR)",

Otto discusses the distinction between norm-referenced, standardized achievement tests and criterion-referenced measures. Johnson shows how the teacher can prepare his own criterion-referenced evaluation procedures to fit specific objectives in word attack skills. Berg's paper documents the difficulty in evaluating specific components of reading ability. MacGinitie points out that the nature of what is tested in reading changes from the lower to the higher grades. Carver critically analyzes the relationship between reasoning  and reading. Thorndike discusses some of the problems of test interpretation. The next two papers deal with the instructional setting and the instructional materials. Brittain provides a checklist of points to consider when evaluating classroom organization. A paper by Botel, Dawkins, and Granowsky offers a way of analyzing the structures of sentences to estimate their complexity. The last two papers, Mork's and Jason and Dubnow's, consider the relationship between the reading ability of the child, the material he reads, and his assessment of his reading ability. (WR)",

The subjects were 130 children in primary classes in two Israeli public schools differentiated by socioeconomic status (SES). Stimuli were 31 synthetic Hebrew words. Each child was tested individually on his reading of the list of words. One year later a standardized reading test was administered to all subjects. The results showed a significantly high correlation of letter-sound ability with later reading success for middle SES children first tested in grade 1, but insignificant correlations for middle SES children thereafter. In the lower SES school, the highest correlation was  achieved in grade 2, indicating a one-year lag behind the middle SES school. Letter-sound ability appears to be a good predictor of later reading success when children have just mastered the basic mechanics of the reading process; however, when this beginning phase is ended, the predictive power of letter-sound ability decreases.

        "description":"The purpose of this Title I project was to improve the reading achievement of educationally disadvantaged students. Improvement was also anticipated in the areas of self-reliance, personal worth, attitudes toward reading, and attendance. The subjects, 144 second, third, and fourth graders, were selected on the basis of their scores on a district-wide achievement test, their teacher's recommendation, and an I.Q. at or above 85. Fifty second and third graders were selected to serve as a control group. The Slosson Oral Reading Test (SORT) and Stanford Achievement Test (SAT) were administeres as pre- and post-test measures. The SORT was only administered to the experimental group. Reading Resource Centers were set up as separate but cooperating units with one teacher and one  educational assistant in each unit. Children attended the center one hour each day in groups of ten or less. Educational Developmental Laboratories' materials, &quot;Listen, Look, and Learn,&quot; were used as the core for the program. The results warranted the following conclusions: A majority of the students had a 9 month or more gain in word meaning skills, self-reliance improved for a large percentage of the students, the attitudes of the students toward reading improved, and student attendance improved.

        "description":"The purpose of this research was to experimentally manipulate input and output orders of information and separate storage and retrieval components of prose free recall. The cued partial recall method, used in word list recall, was adapted to a prose learning task. Four short biographical stories of about 55 words each were systematically combined into four larger passages such that each story appeared once in the four possible serial positions of stories. Each story contained six facts about a fictional person. A total of 48 subjects from a basic psychology class were given two and one half minutes to read a passage. Recall followed immediately and subjects were required to recall as much factual information as possible from one story before turning a page to recall material from  another story. The cue used to constrain recall order was the name of the person described in the particular story. Subjects were given unlimited time for recall. The results indicated that the primacy effect in prose free recall is the result of order of recall as well as order of input of information. The primacy effect in prose free recall may be the result of output interference affecting the efficient use of retrieval information. (WR)",

        "description":"The central question of this report concerned the role of formal similarity in free recall of lists of trigrams and lists of three-letter word triads. Similarity was manipulated among trigrams by duplicating words. An initial study showed that lists of 16 letters were learned more rapidly than a list of 16 three-letter words. Therefore, in the major experiment, the subjects were given all appropriate elements on test trials so that only associative learning was required. Increases in formal similarity caused decreases in rate of learning for both types of lists and the mechanisms of the interference seemed to be the same for both types of lists. However, the learning of the trigram lists was more rapid than the learning of the triad lists, the difference being maximal with low  similarity. (Author)",

        "description":"Constant-order paired-associate lists were used in which the numbers 1-24 were stimulus terms, and 24 nouns were response terms. The order of the nouns was varied across five lists to produce a different number of the hierarchical conceptual levels in the lists. There were two degrees of original learning and three types of retention tests after 24 hours. The study-test method was used. Learning rate was related directly to the degree of conceptual structure, but retention was uninfluenced by structure. A further experiment showed that the direct relation between recall and structure found in an earlier study is to be attributed to the anticipation method in which information at recall is an amount that is directly related to the conceptual structure.

The evidence on weak associations established in the laboratory indicated that association was playing a small role, but that the recognition performance on pairs of words was highly predictable from frequency information. However, the use of strongly associated words indicated that the strength of the association per se was not a critical variable in recognition performance. A post hoc expansion of frequency theory was proposed. Some unexpected findings included criterion differences in making frequency judgments as compared with recognition decisions, and criterion differences in recognition tests on homonym pairs as compared with other classes of  word pairs.

        "description":"In his paper addressing the question, &quot;What is English?&quot; Albert Kitzhaber suggests that English is a body of knowledge called grammar, and a body of knowledge called literature, with the skills of communication as a unifying element. James Britton responds to Kitzhaber's paper and suggests that what needs to be asked is, first, &quot;What is the function of the mother tongue in learning?&quot; and, second, &quot;What ought English teachers to be doing?&quot; A response is then made to Britton's paper, and it is suggested, first, that the English teacher should engage pupils in activities which enable pupils through language to represent internally those experiences which are of moment to them, and to improve their mastery of the language. Secondly, English should be viewed as the objective study of  language and as a medium in the study of other subjects. The remaining papers explore process, knowledge, and the English program; language as an intellectual study; what is teachable in composition and how (response is also provided); bifurcation or continuity in English programs; exclusion and inclusion of subjects in English programs; and child-centered curricula.

The rate of this development remains relatively the same for physiologically normal human beings. Through research it is becoming possible to identify critical periods in linguistic development. Teachers could utilize and exploit these growth rhythms by presenting language concepts that the student would be susceptible to at a particular time. Research results support not a preplanned program of instruction, but a flexible teaching strategy in which the teacher uses his knowledge of the developmental sequences to urge students along in the directions in which growth has been indicated. The main role of the teacher would be to provide occasions for pupils to use their  developing language in ways which are appropriate to their level of maturity. Literature curricula should also correspond to levels of student language maturity in terms of dominant themes. The study group's responses, prompted by Whitehead's paper, are included. (LL)",

The analysis of grouping, in its origin and in its consequences for students, concludes that its effect on the subject of English has been catastrophic, its need is unproved, and its principles are of dubious character. While it is not suggested that grouping be dropped from the English curriculum, it is suggested that the subject of grouping receive careful analysis by English educators and researchers alike in order to determine whether it is a fitting response to student needs, backgrounds, and interests. A group statement, &quot;Aims in English,&quot; demonstrates that the  purposes of English instruction are at odds with the grouping process. Also included is a section on &quot;Improvement and How to Achieve It.&quot; Appendixes cover such subjects as whether the objectives of the English courses should be the same for all students, including those who are college bound; the English room as workshop; an inductive approach to English language teaching; and the segregation of students on the basis of merit.

In the initial paper, a short review of language teaching practices in the United States since 1900 is presented. At that time, both grammar texts and books on language written for the general public displayed a rigid and unyielding attitude toward grammar, while most philologists and linguists tried to demonstrate the concept that a single monolithic standard of good English was untenable in theory and not in accord with fact. It is this dichotomy and attempts to resolve it that provide the topics pursued in the subsequent papers: suggested definitions of linguistics; native speakers; standard English and the schools; standards and attitudes; explicit teaching of  language concepts; implicit and explicit teaching of the English language; linguistics for the English teacher; social class, linguistic codes, and grammatical elements; and a statement on teaching language.

The concern is with the danger that unself-consciousness in the use of speech (the basis of confident expression and behavior) may be adversely affected if the planned procedure for speech  instruction is introduced prematurely or is handled in an awkward and mechanical fashion.

The initial paper discusses the English lesson as helping pupils to use their native language to deal with individual and group experiences. Drama, seen as part of the classroom use of oral language, may arise from a topic proposed by the teacher, a shared experience, or a work of literature. Drama, however, differs from other classroom talk in three ways: (1) movement and gesture play a larger part in the expression of meaning; (2) a group working together on an improvisation needs more deliberately and consciously to collaborate; and (3) the narrative framework allows for repetition and provides a unity that enables the action  more easily to take on symbolic status.

Seven appendixes prepared by the study group on myth are included and address themselves to such issues as how the  study of myth might affect teaching style, training in myth criticism, effects of translation on cultural myths, modern psychoanalytic approach to myth, problems in modern readings of myth, and accountability of education for social myths.

Allen discusses the history of external examinations in Britain, paying particular attention to the General Certificate of Education (GCE) examinations and the dichotomy that exists between language and literature portions of the test. Most students who are college bound are &quot;done with English&quot; at the age of sixteen; only those who specialize in English go on to higher level English tests focusing on literature, at the university level. In response to this traditional form of testing, the British reexamined their test forms, which resulted in an alternate-choice test, the Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE), which pays particular attention to  the individual student, more closely relates language and literature, and provides an oral examination which the GCE ignored. The American paper responds by commenting on the College Entrance Examination Boards, noting the attention paid to vocabulary and multiple-choice items. Advantages and disadvantages of the Advance Placement English and the Graduate Record Examination in English are considered. The author concludes by suggesting that a profile of the student's writing may tell a great deal more than a straight examination. (HOD)",

The last paper by Alan Purves discusses writing about literature (literary criticism) and the elements of writing that an individual might combine in any number of ways to fashion an essay. (HOD)",

Each of these variables relates to the way in which the content of prose is organized to convey meaning to the reader. The first variable is the position of information in a structure representing a passage's organization. The second variable deals with the pattern of organization of a passage. The third deals with the amount of signaling given by the author to help the reader use the passage's organization. It is suggested that these three variables, which tap different aspects of the organization of information in prose, will be valuable tools for investigating how people learn and remember information from prose.

In 1952 Bolivia underwent a social and economic revolution. As a result, angry mobs forced the closure of the two newspapers with the largest circulation in Bolivia--&quot;La Razon&quot; and &quot;Los Tiempos&quot;--when the new regime refused to provide police protection. Although the revolutionary government gave Bolivia political stability and social reform, this record was marred by twelve years of blacklisting by the IAPA. The Bolivian experience is representative of the misuse of censure power by the IAPA to foster its own political ends. Bolivian authorities disputed claims of the IAPA on the grounds that  the organization was composed of entrepreneurs and that a proper investigation had not been conducted. In the case of &quot;Los Tiempos,&quot; the exiled publisher Canelas himself was a member of the committee. (EE)",

In the city council election, students were more heavily exposed to the campus \"daily\" than to other mass media of interpersonal sources, and the influence was effective. The newspaper was an important force in stimulating students to register to vote. However, in the national election, surveys showed that the news paper's  endorsement of one candidate did not influence the attitudes of the students. It was concluded that the campus newspaper may play an important role in student voting in new and uncertain elections but is of much less importance in national political issues and candidate choice.

Political messages on television tend to set agendas--create from whole cloth the political issues and the ranking importance of the issues. However, mass media, especially television, is currently tending to reduce creditability of  the political system in the minds of citizens. Election participation will falter if this trend continues.

Instruments used to collect data included a picture interview, a sentence imitation  test, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, and the Cooperative Primary Reading Test. Measures of syntactic elaboration showed few significant differences between the black and white samples, with no general tendency toward more elaborated speech on the part of the white children.

The seminar reviewed the literature on organizations and organizational communication and met with personnel from the communications department of the Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco).

Other areas include descriptive field studies, to reveal what happens when the black communicator speaks, and the development of a notational system for recording black nonverbal behavior.

Such scholars must respond to forces which seek to suppress their work and must also seek better ways of understanding the unique characteristics of communication among blacks. Investigations in black English should seek an understanding of the black's linguistic past and present, as well as the black's language usage as it affects the quality of his children's education and his efforts to succeed in his occupation. However, much research by whites in black communication mistakenly concentrates on &quot;street talk&quot; and is adversely affected by two racial assumptions: first, that blacks are basically happy, sensuous people, and second, that extensive use of  profanity is a distinctive characteristic of all black communication. Therefore, although communication studies by whites can help blacks gain a better understanding of themselves, they do little to contribute to their struggle for liberation. Black scholars' research offers greater promise. (RN)",

Black rhetoric is inherently interactive, combining verbal, tonal, musical, and physical behaviors, whereas traditional white-oriented rhetoric can be viewed in terms of standard verbal and literary aspects of communication. Pertinent investigations of black communication must relate to the white-controlled communications media, which are components of a complex American consumer-technology system that imitates, absorbs, and neutralizes hostile or non-integrated phenomena such as student dissent and black protest movements. Areas which demand increased attention in this context include: (1) the interactive patterns of black rhetoric; (2) the interaction  between black methods of communication and the white-controlled media; and (3) techniques by which poets, novelists, and dramatists depict the complexity of black communication and the tensions between blacks and whites.

Aside from lyrics, there are musical signals that are of communicational importance to blacks because of special uses of rhythm, melody, inflection, scale patterns, harmony, and improvisation. Black music has been largely influenced by two durable styles that possess tested communicative powers. One is  the antiphonal (call and response) song, issuing directly from African traditions. The other is the blues, the foundation of much popular black music and an embodiment of those elements which characterize black culture and the life style of blacks.

Rhetorical criticism of Thoreau's \"Plea for Captain John Brown\" (1859) and the Antony Towne and William Stringfellow letter in defense of the Berrigan brothers (1972) reveals five similar rhetorical strategies. These strategies tend to define the \"genre\" of discourse called \"moral justification for legal transgressions.\" One line of argument is a defense of illegal actions by the invocation of higher moral law. Other approaches include the acknowledgement of the inevitability of and disregard for the punishment which ensues from the illegalities; an assailing of the government agency which precipated the events leading to the illegal acts and  punishment; the identification of the accused with morally superior beings, using religious imagery as supportive argument; and the proclamation that the illegal acts measurably aid a good cause.

In response, the SCA should try to answer these needs by encouraging specific programs. One such program which would aid all levels of speech communication teachers is the stimulation of broader curricular development. Curricula improvement should be accompanied by more inservice training  programs and greater attention to the quality of classroom teaching methods. A higher level of research in speech communication education, as well as more intensive teacher education in colleges, is necessary if these goals are to be achieved. Other programs which should be fostered by SCA to strengthen speech communication teaching are more faculty exchange programs, stronger regional speech communication associations, and more feedback of member opinions to the national SCA office.

Not only is the principle of confrontation applicable in the realm of  factual knowledge, but it can be applied to value statements as well.

Friendship networks, in fact, are the principal sources for dealers and their customers for awareness of drugs and drug effects, drug abuse, and  treatment methods and for initiating neophytes to experimentation.

        "description":"In this monograph, the author presents a history of court decisions that outlawed public school segregation, reviews these decisions, and examines the problems of decision implementation that followed. The texts of some of the opinions delivered by the various courts are presented. Various relevant concepts are also set out in the context of their legal/historical settings, such as tracking, separation-within-the-school, de facto and de jure segregation, zoning, busing, freedom of choice, transferring, grade-a-year and option plans, faculty desegregation, and affirmative powers. The landmark Brown vs Board of Education of Topeka decision is studied with regard to impact, along with other historical segregation rulings. Regarding the problems of court segregation ruling  implementation, the author discusses delays, the role of private and neighborhood schools, zoning, and assignment within schools. Judicial restraints and the courts' occasional \"get tough\" rulings concerning zoning strategies are examined. The author also reviews the courts' relationship to the freedom of choice plans, presenting early decisions, opinions of the plans, and the development of further court \"tests.\" The court's review and eventual disallowance of the \"grade-a-year\" desegregation plans and the construction and pairing of schools are also discussed in some detail.

Through various case histories, the State's power vs the fundamental rights of individuals is studied at length. Litigations are reviewed in which a 3-way balance was sought among the State's interest, the child's interest, and the parents' interest. Statutory provisions affecting school attendance and student assignment and placement are outlined, and early compulsory attendance laws are examined to illustrate the progression towards achieving this balance. Tables and appendixes enable the reader to compare the approaches of the various 50 States to the subject of compulsory attendance, revealing the existence or nonexistence of such laws themselves  and listing the penalties for noncompliance, where such laws are actually in effect. Alternatives and exemptions to compulsory attendance are also discussed. In this area, the historic Wisconsin vs Yoder case is reviewed -- a litigation in which Amish parents successfully contested the State's power to require the school attendance of their children past the eighth grade. Cases involving similar exemptions because of religion, marriage, mental or physical incapacity, distance from school, or work permits are also studied in detail. (Editor/EA)",

The construction manager should have special skills in construction, cost analysis, critical path method scheduling, and be familiar with the qualifications of local subcontractors. When coordinated with fast-track scheduling (overlapping phases of design and construction that have traditionally occurred end-to-end) and pre-engineered building systems, construction management not only achieves dramatic savings in time and money, but also insures that the completed building meets the objectives for which it was originally intended. This review surveys many recent journals and several documents previously announced in  ERIC catalogs pertaining to the conception and application of construction management for school building programs. The majority of the literature surveyed discusses the nature of the construction management team, emphasizing the need for the educator-client to participate directly in the decisionmaking processes of the building program.

The research, conducted since 1960, comes from several academic disciplines, employs a wide variety of techniques and methods, and is geographically representative of the United States. Significant findings, drawn from an analysis of over 100 empirical research reports, are integrated with partial theories based on economic self-interest, socioeconomic status, community responsibility and distance attitudes, and a politicized electorate versus an informed democratic electorate. Research that outlines the groups of voters most likely to vote &quot;yes&quot; on school financial issues and that contrasts them with those voters most likely  to vote &quot;no&quot; is also summarized. The authors comment on changes in the traditional voting patterns in school financial elections and the trend toward increasing defeat of school financial issues by groups that have traditionally supported such issues. An appendix comprises a synthesization of the research reviewed and shows dependent and independent variables as correlates by &quot;yes&quot; voting and election success; and a 238-item bibliography on voter behavior in school financial elections.

They propose an alternative model of education that emphasizes values and processes consistent with a commitment to an explicit humanistic ethical concept. The authors contend that learning is the exploring, integrating, and transcending of the immediate experience. Therefore, the learning environment should provide a wide range of options for students and teachers alike; opportunities for action and direct participation by students and teachers at all levels of decisionmaking; and for radically different, individually defined, emerging directions. The  schooling model offered here as an alternative to the behavioral objectives model is rooted in explicit value choices and in consistently derived interpretations of the present cultural milieu.

A special survey form was developed to gather data from principals of buildings, superintendents of schools, teachers, building and grounds supervisors, and custodians. Questions relating to economics, State board regulations, the better and the less satisfactory features, and the extent of communication between the architect and  educators were answered from interview responses of the various local school people. Data concerning room schedule practices (including utilization, number of pupils, and multipurpose use spaces) were gathered from tables. The report lists common mistakes to avoid, underscores the need for comprehensively documented educational specifications, and provides suggestions and recommendations for school personnel planning new facilities.

The project evaluation was accomplished by teaching elementary accounting both conventionally and by the system employing self-instructional materials during one semester and then comparing the performance scores of treatment groups on a number of subtests by analysis of variance. According to the report, those students who used the self-instructional materials did significantly better on  subtests than did the conventionally taught students.

        "description":"In 1970, the OISE library published an annotated bibliography entitled, Open Plan (See ED 051 549), that covered the design of open plan schools and the educational practices connected with these facilities. Since then, a clearer distinction has developed between the terms \"open plan\" and \"open education.\" This revision of the earlier volume covers both these aspects of openness, but in two separate parts. Part I covers open education. Much of the current literature on open education is concerned with (1) evolving a theory to support or validate existing practices and (2) with developing criteria to measure the openness of programs to provide a framework for research. The items in this section are arranged under general; theory, analyses, definitions; and research. Part II covers  open plan schools. The earlier concentration on design and construction has changed to an emphasis on the assessment of the effects of open space on students, teachers, and educational programs. Thus there is an expanding literature of research. The items in this section are arranged under designs and descriptions, and research. The overall concentration is on selected references to materials published since 1970, but a few basic items and pertinent Canadian references from the earlier bibliography are also included. Those items available from the ERIC document reproduction service are so indicated. (Compiler/EA)",

The review included visits to 46 schools in 13 districts in California, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, and Texas. The principal obstacles found in reaching all needy school children are schools' adoption of practices in administering the free- and reduced-price lunch policy that do not comply with Food and Nutrition Service regulations; needy families' refusal to have their children accept the school lunches free or at reduced prices; and the inadequate coverage by FNS regional office and State  agency reviewers of the schools' implementation of, and success in complying with, free- and reduced-price lunch policies.

        "description":"This report is a companion analysis to the Statewide educational needs assessment (EA 005 415). The companion analysis is not a completed study, but rather a feasibility study that asks some questions of some data as a heuristic device delimiting some parameters for further efforts within the Wisconsin State Department of Education. The data analysis model explicit in this companion analysis is that of asking questions of data -- a process through which management can be improved within existing data gathering and fiscal constraints. Only certain questions have been asked in this study because (1) it is intended as a companion analysis, (2) it is intended as a beginning, and (3) the information currently available is limited especially in terms of educational outputs.

The Virginia Quality Standards for Education were analyzed as to their impact on equalization of educational spending throughout the State. Particular attention was given to requirements for improved school facilities and personnel as well as to higher levels of mandated academic achievement. Secondly, the Virginia school financing system was evaluated for its existing deficiencies in revenue and expenditure matters, particularly with regard to fiscal disparities and local property tax reform. Potential remedies to these deficiencies were defined and analyzed, with many remedies being suggested from a Statewide survey of school  superintendents on the broad issue of educational finance reform in Virginia.

The first report concentrated on a questionnaire approach to allow a cross section of the population to give their perceptions of Washington State educational needs. One of the principal purposes of the present study was to gather indepth information from the same representative sample of State residents on the same needs, through group interviews rather than questionnaires. This report discusses the methodology and the relationships of the various dimensions of learner needs that are studied and categorizes these needs. It concentrates on probing for the underlying reasons for the perceived needs indicated by the  respondents in the Phase I report. The six categories of needs are student involvement, educator-learner relationships, student self-image, curriculum structure, community involvement, and educational administration.

        "description":"Utilizing a data base obtained from a survey commissioned by Congress in 1964 and carried out in 1965, this study attempted to discover what characteristics of the nation's schools are most closely related to school outcomes. Methods were devised by which school influence could be distinguished from social background influences. A five percent stratified cluster sample was taken from a population consisting of the students, teachers, principals, and superintendents of the nation's public elementary and secondary schools. Since one of the purposes of the study was to determine the educational opportunities of minority groups, strata with higher percentages of nonwhites and other minority groups were sampled more heavily. One of the principal findings of the study was that the  influence of the school cannot be separated from that of the student's social background. Additionally, the study found that the common influence of the school and the student's social background exceed either of their distinguishable influences. Other findings are discussed, and conclusions are drawn. (Author/JF)",

One measure was to set up effective counseling programs for students and a continuing program of instruction on the nature of drugs and their use or abuse. The school system also developed opportunities for parents and other citizens to understand the schools' approach to the understanding and elimination of drug abuse. Cooperative programs with other local, State, and national agencies with respect to determination of the basic causes of drug ause were  inaugurated; and procedures and guidelines to eliminate opportunities for the sale or distribution of drugs were developed.

The perception of board members, superintendents, principals, and teachers was compared. The board members, designated as the formal leaders of the group, were asked to state the tasks that must be performed to solve the problems of a school system. Each person was asked to indicate who among the group was responsible for performing the designated task. Findings indicate that (1) there is widespread disagreement among school system personnel concerning role responsibility; (2) superintendents are expected to be the prime movers in initiating solutions to  educational problems; (3) there is great disagreement between board members themselves and between board members and the rest of the group concerning their own role; (4) teachers are the forgotten members in the problemsolving operation of a school system; (5) principals and teachers disagree on the proper role of superintendents and board members; and (6) differences of opinion among board members concerning their own role were evident in such areas as functions of the local schools, improving instructional material, and fiscal control.

The assessment of the existing knowledge of the planning and design of sports facilities included, in part, a questionnaire survey of the problems facing constructors of these facilities (sent in 1963 and 1967-68 to correspondents in 43 countries); the technical detailing of several installations of particular interest that represent solutions to the problems outlined; a review of the literature on the subject; the identification, classification, and annotation  of relevant documentation; and the compilation of document availability. This publication is meant as a blueprint for future research, publications, and pilot projects in member States in drawing up national guidelines or directives for sports facilities planning and for identifying desirable experimental undertakings. Appendixes contain addresses of organizations where technical information may be obtained and a bibliography. (Photographs may reproduce poorly.) (Author/MLF)",

It has been developed for the use of Ministries of Education and other interested departments in developing countries to help them develop the basic set of statistics necessary for national reporting and planning. The publication begins with a general discussion of the educational statistician and educational statistics. It then examines the problem of collecting educational statistics both within and outside of the school system. Chapters dealing with the analysis and reporting of educational statistics discuss records and reference tables, analytical tables, diagrams and graphs, averages and comparisons, enrollment  and entry rates, wastage, forecasting, and publishing. The document concludes with suggestions for organizing a statistical department and suggestions for further research. A selected bibliography is included. (Author/DN)",

The author approaches this material from an international and comparative point of view and shows the need for more systematic reporting of cases of change from other parts of the world. The publication is intended to serve as the basis for a seminar in institutions of training and research or to provide a busy administrator with ideas on how he may strive for qualitative improvements and increased effectiveness in his educational system. The study examines at some length the concept of innovation and those factors and agents that prohibit or encourage innovation. The greater part of the study is concerned with the  mechanism of innovation. This analysis leads finally to the presentation of these three models that can each be used to account for the way certain innovations take place: research and development, social interaction, and problemsolving. The study concludes with some remarks on the problem of evaluating the process of educational change so that the results can be demonstrated when measured against the initial objectives.

Past socioeconomic trends in Sri Lanka and its economy in the 1970's are considered first. The case study then moves into descriptions of the educational system of Sri Lanka in the 1960's, the new educational system of the 1970's, and estimates of the cost and financing of education in the 1970's. Since the government of Sri Lanka has already formulated an educational plan and made budget forecasts for education to 1980, the author attempts to discover if the financing forecasts were consistent with the new policy officially defined. He also analyzes the various  alternatives calculated either to provide new resources or reduce expenditures if the financial requirements forecast turns out to be too low. The appendixes contain useful statistical data on education in and the economy of Sri Lanka. (Author/DN)",

However, the document provides no explanation of the methods of drawing up a plan; no descriptions of new administrative techniques, such as cost-benefit analysis or operational forecasting; and only touches briefly on specific educational problems and educational policy formation. After an historical outline of educational planning, the document explores the evolution of the concept of educational planning, educational expenditures, educational planning authorities, the inadequacies  of past action, and some future planning difficulties. It next considers the determination of educational aims and policies; social and economic development; and the relation of educational development, technical and practical problems in educational planning, educational strategies, and research in educational planning. The final section deals with educational administration, resource allocation, educational finance, and the training of an educational planning staff. (Author/DN)",

The population factor was examined along with other factors influencing educational costs, such as the improvement of enrollment ratios, the need for a qualitative improvement in the educational system, and the long term trends of the unit costs of education systems. Comparison of these factors, it was hoped, would provide data helpful to educational planners in deciding on an educational development policy to be followed. In order to ascertain more precisely the possible effects of these factors on educational costs, four national case studies were made in Ceylon,  Colombia, Tanzania, and Tunisia. These case studies, limited to first-level education and teacher training, were conducted on a standard pattern to allow for a comparative analysis. Each case study is reported in a separate chapter, and two other sections of the document contain a synthesis report of the case studies and a model that shows the effect of demographic growth on the development and cost of first-level education and teacher training.

The study was undertaken to ascertain the comparative position of the relatively new schools of the Education Corps, from the standpoint of their financing; and from the level of unit costs and efficiency, in relation to their longer established public and private counterparts. The study concludes that the Education Corps, which requires young people in the military with second-level education certificates to teach their juniors and even their elders for a limited time, has been able to provide schooling in inaccessible rural areas under more satisfactory cost conditions than  those of ordinary schools.

Particular attention is paid to the view that although such local communities tend to reduce short-term costs for governments, they limit, at the same time, the opportunities to develop new and wider strategies of educational development. The document begins with a historical survey of the self-help schools.

This study examines the utilization of composite measures of a pupil's base level of performance as effective predictors of learning expectancy. In addition to an individual student's knowledge and skills at learning commencement, the study also takes into account several important factors (such as mental age, years in school, age norms, and school history) to provide a statistically significant performance potential for each child. In this way, the approach remains sensitive to the goals of specific programs or the objectives of a particular school district. The data are also comparable  across teachers, and could possibly be used as the basis for a teacher evaluation system. (Author)",

Analysis of the data reveals that the Arkansas superintendent is slightly younger and that he enters the profession earlier than the average American school superintendent. In addition, he has slightly less teaching experience, stays longer in his first superintendency, and has fewer years of experience as a superintendent. His salary is lower than the national average, but his professional preparation compares favorably. Arkansas superintendents report they work an average of 54.5 hours per week (as against a 56.1 national average), and the overwhelming ratio of men to women in the job is the same. (Author)",

The sample was composed of 6,127 white 1967 graduating seniors in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area high schools. College aspirations were measured in terms of college expectations by asking respondents to indicate whether they were seriously considering entering college the following year. The socioeconomic status for individual students was determined from their answers to four questions that provided information along 5-point scales concerned with the educational level of the household head, father's or household head's occupation, respondent's estimate of number of books in the house, and a  description of family finance. The school social status was determined by classifying public high schools according to the occupational distribution of the families of the graduating seniors who were included in the study.

        "description":"In November 1973, California voters rejected a proposal by the governor to place constitutional limitations on the amount of State tax collections and expenditures. The initiative provided that the overall expenditure limitation could be increased or decreased by a majority vote of the people in a Statewide election. Such a change was to be placed on the ballot by a two-thirds vote of the legislature or directly by petition of five percent of the voters under the initiative process of the State Constitution. Other provisions were included to permit specific increases or decreases in the limitation consistent with the general intent of the initiative to maintain an expenditure ceiling. In this report, four Berkeley faculty members and three research associates present their views  concerning the proposed measure. Following the essays, William Niskanen (a proponent of the measure) offers a response to the three authors whose views are generally critical. Replies to the rebuttal conclude the text. (Author/JF)",

Thus, a second project was launched to investigate schools already operating under a nontraditional mode of instructional staff organization where change facilitators and fruitful strategies for surmounting implementation barriers might be more observable.

        "description":"This document suggests a management plan for replacing fixed salary schedules for teachers with a pay structure based on student productivity. The plan is more a conceptual process of attacking the problem, rather than the resolved finality of a specific plan. The instructional objectives, the accomplishment evaluation, and the subsequent amount of compensation earned in accordance with this idea, are all basically determined by the professional staff itself as part of the evolutionary development of the suggested method. The author begins by outlining the historical unwillingness of public school employers and employees to attempt the correlation of compensation factors with employee production. He then considers factors that have changed in the 1970's to make a compensation  plan based on productivity more attractive. The balance of the presentation is given over to a discussion of the essential premises on which the plan is based, an overview of the plan, and a procedural implementation of a plan from the time it is first presented to the board to the time when objectives are created and evaluated. The document concludes with a discussion of the management control of such a plan. (Author/DN)",

Such a procedure calls for moving through several phases: preparation for planning, analysis of the situation, development of alternatives, selection of a plan, implementation of the plan, and evaluation of the plan and of the process. Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) diagrams assist in the utilization of a totally cooperative process, comprising both in-house involvement of staff and out-of-house objectivity and resources. The process appears to be applicable to any planning need regardless of its dimensions. It can apply to the development of long-range, systemwide plans affecting the community's total educational program, as well as to the  renovation of existing facilities, or to short-range planning for the utilization of a single school or site.

Results indicate generally high agreement among the total sample of parents and teachers regarding the top 20 goals.

The author argues against full State funding because he believes that the net effect of many independent decisions that affect small groups of children is preferable to a single decision made at the State level, and that cost variations among districts preclude setting a single expenditure figure for the entire State. As an alternative, the author proposes a school finance program that includes a minimum support program below which no district may spend, a discretionary range of expenditures supported by State and local funds according to the power equalizing concept (including a negative aid  provisions), maximum support level beyond which no district may spend, and special aids for extroardinary educational needs.

In addition to the requirement for program priorities and efficient use of space, the city school site is also responding to its requirement of being a part of community life. The urban school site is extending itself into the community by lending itself to community use. Meeting rooms, headquarters space for volunteer groups, and shared resource facilities and outside spaces are being developed with greater participation of the community in mind. Furthermore, the space around a city school is now recognized as an  excellent educational opportunity to display the balance between man and his environment. School sites are locations where students can gain a greater understanding of the myriad processes and functions that are interwoven into the urban fabric, and their possible effects on the viability of the urban dweller.

        "description":"This is a report of a study of classroom assignments as perceived by seniors in four rural and smalltown high schools in eastern Kentucky. However, the approach taken in the study could be useful in the appraisal of programs in any school. The study hypothesized that (1) the learning content is experience, and a given experience is related to the goals of the activity which constitute that experience; and that (2) what students do is a function of the role settings the school provides and the numbers of those settings in relation to the numbers of students. The assignment was perceived to be the prime instrument, device, or means by which the teacher generates role situations wherein students could develop into the kinds of people the school is intended to produce. The model of  teaching assumed was that effective teaching places the teacher in an eternal dilemma between guiding enough and guiding too much. The approaches developed and applied in this study should enable school staffs in any school to gather information useful as a basis for making better judgments about where the balance of emphasis in assignments might be placed for more effective teaching.

        "description":"In searching for a concept of organization which recognizes its base in human action rather than in objective structure, the author draws on a European tradition stemming from the works of Max Weber. This tradition, combined with examples of organizational life in schools, serves to identify implications for those who attempt to design better organizational forms. These implications suggest to the author that the problems with schools will not be solved by manipulating the external structures of organizations but rather, by dealing with the often conflicting views and values of those acting within these structures. The author suggests that the task of changing organizations depends on the varieties of reality that individuals see in existing organizations, and on the acceptance  of new ideas concerning what is possible and desirable to do through social action. He suggests that, although little is known about either of these dependencies, the first should be understood before the second is directed. (Author/DN)",

For this reason, the would-be progressive school principal faces a challenging task of inquiry, information, persuasion, and affirmative action. It is explicit in the story of British open education that the head teacher plays a vital role in the development and support of the program. Similarly, a strong assumption in American writings is that the principal will and must be an educational leader. It follows, then, that unless principals do commit themselves to the cause of open education, that cause may not flourish. Leadership in planning, provisioning, and more imaginative exploitation of the school's physical environment is one of the important contributions  a principal can make. (Author)",

        "description":"Questionnaires were administered to the staffs of two elementary schools as part of a program to identify salient forces within schools that facilitate or inhibit the implementation of educational innovations. One school, an \"experimental\" school, was engaged in a district differentiated staffing project; the other, a \"control\" school, was a conventional school of similar size and student clientele. Findings indicate that two general inferences may be drawn about the innovative process. First, some structural changes are almost inescapable in an innovating school and its work system, and the consequences of such changes are not always congruent with the innovation intended. Secondly, major implementation projects normally have \"disruptive effects\" that divert teacher attention  away from those duties they regard as their foremost responsibility. These circumstances constitute the hidden costs of change and should be recognized in advance in order that false expectations of success are not entertained and provisions can be made during the implementation phase for minimizing or absorbing these expectations. When excessive, the costs of change carry the imminent threat of staff disaffection with the innovation. (Author/WM)",

The goals of this event were to establish widespread understanding and favorable attitudes about organization development, to identify intergroup problems (especially across hierarchical levels) that would provide the content and motivation for subsequent communication skill training and problemsolving, and to establish norms for collaboration within and across the various participating role-groups. Questionnaires were administered to these participants and and to a matched comparison group from two nearby school districts during the spring terms  in 1968, 1969, and 1970. Although interpretations of the data are not unequivocal, the authors are convinced that experiencing the imaging procedure so early in the total OD design did predispose most of the key line personnel to look favorably on subsequent OD training for the entire district.

This paper develops a simplified model of a political marketplace, linking together individual demand for a public good and the vote in fiscal elections to set the supply and the tax-cost of such a good, where both the system of elections and the system of taxation are taken as givens. Data from school budget elections in Oregon are applied to the model and the demand for education under varying tax-cost conditions and overtime in Oregon is estimated. The resultant analysis leads to a markedly different  interpretation of the increase in rejection of school finance proposals than that of a &quot;taxpayers' revolt.&quot; Moreover, the analysis traces directly the linkage between demand for education and the tax-cost of education and indirectly the linkage between demand for education and the quality or valuation of education. Such findings have major implications in assessing the present state of public school finance and in formulating public school finance policy. (Author)",

This publication was developed to provide a guide for educators and planners who are seeking to put to use one innovation in educational facilities -- \"found\" space. The planner cannot easily mold existing space to fit his needs; rather, he must work within the parameters of space originally designed to meet entirely different requirements. To assist the planner,  this publication examines the planning principles he can use to achieve this objective and, through a series of questions, assists him in an evaluation of potential space for conversion.

The study attempted to determine relative costs of providing meals under alternative production and distribution systems, establish standards relating to food costs and labor efficiency that could be used in appraising the relative performance of a school's food program, and provide management information that could be used in estimating cost changes associated with proposed modifications of an existing school lunch system or in the initial selection of a system. The average costs of providing meals under school owned and operated alternative production and distribution systems are determined, and comparable average costs for commercially  provided supplies and services are provided. Findings indicate that the average cost of a meal produced in a self-contained kitchen is 62.9 cents in the North and 48.7 cents in the South. Northern satellite systems provide a meal for 53 cents, but the average is 56.9 cents in the South. Findings also show that labor costs are the biggest source of variation in the preparation of a school lunch, and that contract management and commercially supplied preplate systems are competitive alternatives to school managed and operated systems.

This goal was attained when it was found that a regression equation, using four variables from the Third Count (block statistics) of the Census, accounted for 75 percent of the variance in 6th grade achievement scores in a sample of 122 elementary schools in Chicago. The four variables (Per Cent of Females Separated; Per Cent of Families Which Lack One or More Plumbing Facilities; Per Cent of Units With Six Persons or More; and Per Cent Owner Occupied Units) also provided the basis for exploratory  analysis with a number of additional variables. Separate analysis with a sub-sample of 50 black schools showed that Per Cent of Females Separated did not contribute independently in predicting achievement levels in these schools. The results are discussed in terms of the possibility that concentrations of urban poverty signify social and institutional disorganization over and beyond the effects of poverty per se. (Author)",

        "description":"This report summarizes the procedures and results of a 2-year project carried our collaboratively by a university-based research and development center and a nearby high school. The first section summarizes the setting and rationale of the project (the Focused Flexibility project.) The ideas basic to the project were (1) a school should try to provide for each student only as much flexibility of activities as the student can profit from educationally and as much as the school can handle organizationally; (2) extensive measures of student outputs should be routinely collected and used, not only to maximize the student's chance for educational progress but also to provide appropriate positive feedback to all students. The next section of the report describes how these ideas were  implemented. It emphasizes the importance of records management activities and describes a school records system called GREG, also developed for the project. Some difficulties with respect to records-management are discussed. The concluding section considers some of the main reasons for the difficulties encountered in establishing and maintaining accurate internal files in a school. It argues that these difficulties highlight an important but seldom recognized requirement for successful flexibility -- the capability to design and use records-management systems of high quality within the school.

Paired-associate learning is said to involve mediation of associations for numbers, letters, grouping of numbers or letters, or other groups such as words. It is explained that retardates have been used as subjects in research on paired-associate learning because they tend to de-emphasize spontaneous use of verbal mediators and because studies require a control mechanism, which in this case is the verbal mediator. Mentioned in a brief history are considerations of philosophers, psychologists, and experimentalists. Research studies are cited which deal with such aspects of positive and negative transfer as nonsense syllables, associative strength, serial strength, temporal factors,  and directionality.

Testimony is reviewed which claimed the failure to provide notice and a hearing prior to exclusion to be unconstitutional and that evidence is lacking to support the assumption that certain retarded children are untrainable. The end result of the consent agreement is seen to be a zero reject system, with school districts responsible for locating previously excluded  children. The agreement is explained to order the state to refrain from postponing school entrance, to refrain from denying homebound instruction, to provide free education for every person between 6 and 21 years, to provide a preschool program for the retarded if such a program exists for regular students, to provide opportunity for a hearing if a child's educational status is to be changed, and to reevaluate the educational assignment of every mentally retarded child not less than every 2 years.

The child care teacher is thought to be a mother substitute who can help the child learn to trust the world. Mothering is seen to involve a natural drive to care for and protect the young, and consideration of individual differences. The teacher is warned against competing with the mother's love for the child to prevent emotional problems. The mothering teacher is seen to fill emotional needs by offering affection, comforting the hurt child, showing interest, appreciating accomplishment, and helping build a positive self image. The mothering teacher is also shown to meet physical needs such  as nourishment, toileting, sleep, and exercise. Aspects of social development such as self control, consideration for others, and accepting responsibility are other functions encouraged by the mothering teacher. The mothering teacher is said to build language ability through such activities as talking and listening, story telling, and singing.

        "description":"The booklet is the third in a series on the ways that child care centers can contribute to the healthy growth, and development of preschool children, and focused on is helping the child adapt to change. The change of starting school is viewed in terms of the mother's role, the difficulty of leaving mother behind, feelings of the first day, getting acquainted, and the need for special help. Another change is reported to be a teacher's absence, and preparation is recommended for short absences or a new teacher. Among the big events in a child's life which are said to be eased by a teacher's help are a new baby, moving, going to the hospital, and getting shots. Changes in schedule such as having to wait, bad weather, visitors, trips, and special days are other changes seen to  require a child's adjustment. Shifts in activities such as from active to quiet play, at lunch and naptime, arriving and departing, and Monday morning are seen to often be difficult times. Teachers are encouraged to help the child through experiences of sadness and grief such as when a mother goes to the hospital, divorce and separation, prison, or moving to a different foster home. If a child has been absent, help is recommended when he returns to the center in order to become an accepted group member again.

Bedlam in a child care center is seen to be caused by frustration, anger, too much noise, overstimulation, reaction to teacher, contagion, or change in routine. It is suggested that the teacher reduce the irritants that lead to bedlam by arranging furniture to cut down on disruptive intrusions, careful planning of activities, recognizing individual needs, fixing limits on behavior, coping with a child's frustration, gaining obedience, and preparing children for changes. It is recommended that the teacher handle the disruptive child by dispelling anger, quieting the upset child, using  appropriate discipline, and encouraging the development of self control. It is suggested that if bedlam should break loose the teacher should try to understand the cause or causes and use remedies such as playing out feelings or singing.

The vulnerable child is defined as a child who may be overwhelmed by physical and/or emotional handicaps and thus is at risk of later mental illness. Throughout, short case studies are given to illustrate a child's activity or attitude in relation to a handicap and the staff member's role, which might include referral or a planned strategy. Physical handicaps are discussed in terms of motor difficulties, poor vision, loss of hearing, allergies, and special sensitivities such as giddiness on a merry-go-round. Emotional vulnerability is seen in children with a poor start in  life, anxiety, slow social development, and combined handicaps. The care worker is advised to recognize children's fears as normal and to know ways to deal with fears such as holding a child on the lap in a close embrace when thunder rolls. Considered are children who experience stress from events such as a tornado and subsequently exhibit stress signs (regressive behavior or appetite loss), which can be overcome by constant teacher reassurance and acting out games.

Appropriate literary quotes introduce a discussion on creativity, which involves the imaginative recombination of known ideas into something new. Considered are obstacles that work against creativity such as mental laziness, fear of being different, and inadequate motivation. Suggested for teachers to help students use imagination to solve problems are procedures such as establishing an environment of freedom or encouraging self-initiated learning. The creative thinking process is described to consist of defining a problem, collecting data on the problem, and analyzing facts for the fact finding component; producing ideas, incubating ideas, and forcing  different relationships on habitual relationships to develop ideas; and evaluating and adopting ideas to seek solutions. A hypothetical problem of a student who dreads classroom elections because she might not be chosen is presented. The first worksheet contains eight facts on the problem, possible sources, and results. The next worksheet lists questions that might define the problem. On the third worksheet the student circles 16 of 27 ideas that might lead to a solution. The fourth worksheet contains a matrix listing previous ideas according to criteria and decision for present or future use. The last worksheet shows nine ways to carry out the idea of making more friends.

Also evaluated was a summer workshop attended by the participants. The greatest need expressed was in the area of managing unacceptable behavior. Teachers from all three cities approved of inservice modes such as lecture with demonstration, demonstration by expert, and work session with children. Teachers reported a preference for moderate personal active involvement in inservice teacher training programs. The questionnaire covered topics such as demographic data, expressed needs in  general and instructional categories, expressed needs in content areas, endorsement of specific methods of presenting inservice training, and evaluation of content and presentation of workshop material (DB)",

An earlier study (1966) examined the eye coordination of 1152 students in grades 1 through 12. The common Snellen Test of Visual Acuity failed to indicate 42% of students who were diagnosed by other tests to have eye problems. Tests of eye coordination tendencies found students to be either orthophoric (perfect eye coordination), exophoric (laterally divergent) hyperphoric (vertically divergent), or esophoric (laterally over-convergent). Orthophoric students tended to be the youngest in their classes, to be good readers, and to cost less to educate. Esophoric students were poor readers, the oldest in their classes, and the most expensive  to educate. Welfare students with esophoric eye coordination tested lower on IQ and reading than their esophoric non-welfare classmates. It is recommended that each child receive a clinical vision check early in his school life. (DB)",

Several training strategies have been followed to overcome the deficit in verbal abstracting primarily through increasing the child's experience with higher conceptual levels of language. The strategies have been successful in overcoming this deficit on similar tasks, but more information is needed to determine how to enhance generalization of performance to dissimilar tasks. These strategies offer some implications for classroom practice. (Author)",

Use of a systems model for planning, implementing, and evaluating the study was explained. Of the findings given, some showed that more students in EMR classes were Negro than white, and boys than girls; that students' other handicaps were in areas of speech, language, and emotional disturbance; that most teachers preferred the self contained classroom and few had expectations for students' future employment; and that job opportunities existed for students with specific characteristics in agricultural, domestic, and environmental areas. Also,  some of the findings given showed that few differences existed between the curriculums of regular and EMR classes; that teachers used audiovisual aids, library materials, and physical education equipment but needed materials for daily living skills; that psychological services differed in the counties but all stressed placement according to IQ; that more supportive services were available in two large counties, and two counties had no vocational rehabilitation services; and that agency support was available from sources as youth centers and non-profit groups. Recommended were such improvements as development of social and economic curriculums for students at intermediate level, preschool goals; remedial activities; resource rooms, inservice teacher training, work study programs, child  placement procedures based on the individual, and a program involving parents.

Findings showed that the majority of the parents and children liked and used the system, and that one third of the test group indicated willingness to buy the system despite problems encountered which corroborated test results. The tests revealed major weaknesses in the system such as restricted range of less than 75 feet, sensitivity to moisture, erratic performance, and difficult  maintenance of battery charge. Similar testing was conducted with deaf-blind adults in domestic and industrial settings using the Vibralert and another similar device, the MIT TAC-COM.

It is said that &quot;clinical teaching&quot; (individualizing of instruction) is an historical aspiration for implementing the fundamental philosphy of the right to an education of all children. Dilemmas of special educators during the past twenty years are reviewed in terms of exceptional children, available manpower, provisions and  services, clinical teaching, and judicial decisions. Alternative strategies for solving the dilemmas are given in relation to goals, changing concepts, instructional alternatives, and services. The role of the clinical teacher is delineated relative to future competency, procedures such as are found in the instructional system or in task analysis, and individualized instruction by means of a conceptual matching model. Contained in a user's guide are directions for student use of the individualized, performance-based, instructional modules of the program; also, the student's responsibilities are described. Appended are a position statement of performance based teacher education, a sample performance contract, a sample grading scale, and computer management systems transaction logs.

The curriculum is said to be a critical component of the model developed at Florida State University for trainee demonstration of competency in diagnosis and intervention during practicum experience. The conceptual model gives guidelines for reading competency, major competency tests, performance objectives and cluster competency tests. Reading competency is defined as integration of the four major skills of pre-reading, reading-phonetics, reading-linguistics, and reading comprehension. The criterion referenced competency tests are said to be helpful in diagnosis. Individualized  instructional modules described include auditory and visual discirmination, memory, sequential memory, comprehension, and visual letter knowledge in the area of pre-reading; consonants and vowels in the area of reading-linguistics; and phonetics-linguistics, word and phrase meaning, syntax, sentence and paragraph meaning in the area of reading comprehension. Usually given for each area (or competency) is the model cluster (such as visual discrimination), module (such as discrimination of position), purpose, behavioral objectives, instructional resources/options/activities, and sample test items. Appended are lists of words and sentences to illustrate such aspects as rhyming, consonant blending, blends, prefixes, or sentence meaning.

The program's essential innovative features remained computer-controlled tutorial instruction supplemented by conventional individualized learning experiences. Plans were made to store student performance data and to use these to direct both on-line and off-line instruction. A field test of the CAI program was run with 16 students; for six weeks the pupils spent 20 minutes a day with the on-line program and 100 minutes daily with appropriate off-line materials. A manual was prepared for CAI teachers, outlining course content, computerized instructional sequences, program routines, and terminal  operating procedures. A three-week workshop was held to familiarize teachers with the individualized aspects of CAI, to introduce them to computer programing using Coursewriter II language, to acquaint them with the content of the CAI math programs, and to provide them with experience in utilizing off-line materials. Finally, an IBM 1500 system with eight 1510 instructional stations was installed in Lincoln High School in Philadelphia and remodeling continued at Schenley High School in Pittsburgh. (PB)",

The conventional method relied upon factual presentations to heterogeneous groups, while the experimental utilized homogeneous clusters of students and stressed individualized instruction. A pretest-posttest, experimental-control group design was employed with science, humanities and social science teaching majors. Attitude scales and achievement tests measured the relationships of values and performances to majors, and interaction analysis investigated the implementation of methods and their differences. Among the major results were the findings that: 1) the experimental treatment induced more attitude change; 2) humanities majors had aesthetic values, scientists  theoretical ones, and social scientists political values; 3) values correlated poorly with achievement and attitudes; 4) attitude and achievement scores correlated poorly; and 5) the experimental method produced effective textbook learning. It was concluded that the experimental method was as valid as conventional instruction. (Author/PB)",

The overall program seeks to develop, test, and evaluate technical aids to vocational training systems. These are appropriate to this field because the high costs need to be reduced and because there are clear objectives which can serve as criteria of success. The LTS uses microform techniques for information storage, and response branching logic. Broad specifications for LTS are: 1) random access from frame to frame in less than one second; 2) the capability to handle graphic material, including text, diagrams, and halftone reproductions; 3) a display of 30-60 seconds of voice quality audio per frame; 4) response selection logic which is  stored photographically with each frame; 5) console keyboard with provision for author-regulated responding and student browsing; and 6) an option to use a computer for course management and student monitoring. LTS-1 is a mock-up system using commercially available components, designed as a preliminary evaluation of the system specifications given above. LTS-2 is a prototype microfiche system undertaken for design and component development purposes. (LB)",

Results showed such students scored significantly higher on achievement tests and learned substantially faster when they received LTS instruction. An additional study on the use of LTS for task simulation led to the implementation of a new student response interpretation feature for the system. LTS-4 hardware development continued along several lines. Design of the microfiche selector/reader breadboard progressed and an experiment to evaluate pin positioning as an alternative means of vernier positioning was initiated. Results of data demodulation tests indicated that  the system will support a 1200 band data rate.

        "description":"Work on the Lincoln Training System (LTS) conducted during the period covered by this report focused upon 1) applications research for the LTS and 2) on the implementation of a series of experimental design studies. Test results showed that pairs of students could share terminals, with feedback and remediation based on only one student's response, thus permitting more students to be trained at lower costs. Student data summaries for 1) the exact path of each student; 2) the distribution of frame transfer at each frame; and 3) the time per frame, proved valuable for lesson analysis and the evaluation of alternative instructional strategies. The microfiche selector/reader breadboard was completed and studies were begun involving alternative audio readers, x-y positioning schemes,  and fiche manipulation systems. Data from these studies will serve as the basis for decisions regarding the subsystems of LTS-4. Finally, it was determined that the proposed self-processor for LTS-4 was capable of complete reduction of the raw data stored on film, and that the film data channel more than adequately met the system's requirements.

Socio-economic models are also developed to show the consequences of population growth upon variables such as income, productivity, and the demand for food. A one-sex population projection model allows students to project size age distribution, and other demographic characteristics under a variety of assumptions and parameters. A one-sector growth model illustrates the impact of population growth upon economic development, and other supplemental models are available if desired. Descriptive surveys show the program to be successful. It has enormous variety and generates much data with relatively little input. Students achieve awareness of population  growth factors without having to undergo extensive mathematical training, and segments of the program have been utilized by instructors in several other disciplines. The program is primarily tied to the PLATO CAI system but a simplified version is ready for use with other hardware, such as the WANG 700 Programing Calculator and the Hewlett-Packard 9100 B. As CAI becomes available on other campuses, the program will be made accessible to a greater audience. (PB)",

        "description":"A new approach to computer-assisted instruction (CAI) called Author Tutorial System (ATS) was field tested in a National Science Foundation-sponsored school consortium in New York State. ATS was designed as a package of authoring functions written in the APL interactive programing language to enable authors who are not experienced programers to create sophisticated computer-mediated tutorials. A summer workshop held for 72 faculty from the participating schools offered them new uses for CAI, stressing non-linear programs and introducing them to APL. A weekend workshop held in the fall and consisting of lectures and terminal sessions taught faculty members how to develop and revise their own tutorials. Following this, participants developed tutorials for their classes. The  conclusion was reached that ATS could make significant contributions to undergraduate education provided two conditions were met. First, a dynamic relationship must be maintained between: 1) originators, 2) programers, 3) computer teaching professionals acting as interface personnel, and 4) faculty, to insure the effective delivery of programing packages. Secondly sufficient attention must begiven to training faculty. (PB)",

The BRACH program is used in paleontology to demonstrate the natural variations in morphology of a fossil species; SEIS provides an analysis of time-travel relations of seismic waves; and ROTS offers a general purpose rotation program which is helpful in the study of continental drift and paleomagnetism. A time-sharing CAI system is recommended because it allows introductory students to explore exciting fields more thoroughly than otherwise possible and provides the  teacher with instructional flexibility. APL is useful because it requires little computer sophistication on the part of the student, offers an accurate program, quickly performs complicated and time-consuming computational operations for the student, and improves his accuracy and his confidence in his ability to learn.

Task forces were established to investigate information requirements for the program and to write in FORTRAN the necessary statements. The completed program ran under 900 cards, was compiled on a B6700 in .2 minutes, and required .02 minutes to simulate a firm's decisions. Up to 99 firms could be included for 40 periods of play. Participants could  make decision inputs on 11 variables such as loan acquisition, debt retirement, etc., and balance sheets and income and other statements were output to enable decision-making. The program enhanced the decision-making abilities of the players and the project also provided useful training for the designers.

An example of 200 data points is presented which illustrates a computer program's ability to do descriptive statistics for data not grouped, data which is distributed into any number of classes of equal width and testing if the 200 points are normally distributed. The section of linear regression emphasizes how computer programs can lead to erroneous results. In the area linear regression there are in current use &quot;canned programs&quot; which display the t-values corresponding  to the coefficients of the least square estimate, but do not take autocorrelation into account. In the presence of autocorrelation it is incorrect to use these t-values. An example is presented in which autocorrelation is present but can be removed by a suitable transformation of variables.

Student reactions to this mode of learning are favorable, and examination results indicate they learned more and acquired deeper understanding of those topics involving  the calculator's use. Other advantages of programable calculators include the following: 1) their cost is relatively low; 2) they eliminate programing, keypunch, and syntax errors; 3) they are more available to students than the generally overloaded computer system; 4) they facilitate personal involvement by the student, perhaps due to their small size and relative simplicity; 5) their relatively slow speed promotes student awareness of complex calculations; and 6) they expose the student to a valuable educational tool.

Groups were composed on measures of factual content, skills of experimental design and analysis, attitudes toward science and computers, and evaluation of learning experience. Results indicated no significant differences among groups on mastery of factual content or attitude change toward science or computers. In the learning of skills associated with the appropriate labeling of variables and controls in an experiment and with the  recognition of relations in graphed data, results favored those groups which used the computer-assisted simulation of experiments. However, none of the groups could generalize principles of scientific analysis to other contexts. Students rated the computer-assisted simulations as favorably as the instructor-led seminars and expressed a significant preference to continue the computer-assisted experience.

        "description":"A program called Experiment Writer (EW) was designed to enable students to use the computer to sample a range of experimentation situations. EW was used by 20 students in an Advanced Experimental Psychology course; hardware consisted of a PDP-10 computer, and a PDP-15 computer with 12K of core memory and two time-shared stations. Experimental design using EW required three steps: 1) creation of files, 2) trial definition, and 3) block definition. Students performed two teacher-designed experiments to familiarize themselves with variability and the logical relation of experimental design to psychological questions. They next ran each other as subjects on a teacher-designed experiment and devised an experiment of their own dealing with information and reaction time. The third phase  of the course taught them how to use EW, thus giving them full control over the computer. Following this, they designed an experiment creating files and block definitions. For the final exam they designed and ran experiments based upon a methodology presented in a paper. Evaluation indicated that EW successfully introduced students to experimental inquiry and showed that student reaction was favorable. (PB)",

        "description":"One theory of visual communication maintains three things. It holds that attention is a process for obtaining information, that it is a transaction between the visual and the viewer, and that the success of a visual communication is determined by the amount and relevance of information conveyed. Current research aims at evaluating &quot;attention-getters&quot; and training &quot;attention-givers.&quot; The measurement of the former proceeds indirectly through the measurement of occipital alpha rhythms in the brain which are associated with changes in visual control related to changes in attention. Results show that attentional response to a stimulus varies with its relevance and fades with repetition, approaching zero after 30 presentations. Training sessions with biofeedback methods indicate that  subjects can learn to modify and control occipital alpha rhythms. Individuals appear to undergo unique and incommensurable experiences, but there is disagreement on how control over the rhythms is achieved, and there is no evidence as yet which substantiates the position that successful biofeedback attention training helps an individual to learn better.

The report analyzes the performance of network affiliates in the top 50 television markets with respect to programing, female and minority employment, and ownership. It seeks to demonstrate the kind of analysis which can be made, to develop minimum standards, and to design an alternative to government regulation by using public disclosure of information to spur the industry to improve its performance and to motivate the public to challenge substandard licensees. The analyses of performance are based upon public data supplied by licensees to the FCC; in three separate  chapters criteria on programing, employment, and ownership are developed from inspections of the data and the stations are rank-ordered according to their performance. A fourth chapter discusses what citizens can do to improve television in their community. Six appendixes and 17 tables provide detailed data on approximately 150 stations. (PB)",

        "description":"The problem of structuring sequences of instructional stimuli such that learning is optimized is modelled as a sequential decision problem with an imbedded mathematical model of learning providing a criterion function. Three types of optimization methods for such a representation are investigated for the specific case of paired-associate learning using the single-operator linear model, the one-element model, or the random-trial increments (RTI) model. Globally optimal exhaustive-search methods, such as Dynamic Programing, are found to be impractical for all but the simplest problems, due to inherent dimensionality limitations. Algorithmic methods, whereby the optimal decision at each step may be specified immediately without recourse to extensive look-ahead search, appear to be  sufficient for the models investigated, primarily due to the absence of stimulus interaction. An optimal algorithm is specified for a class of learning models which includes the linear, one-element, and RTI models as special cases. Certain previously reported optimal algorithms are shown to be special cases of this algorithm. Finally, a heuristic search technique is outlined as a possible optimization method for problems too large for exhaustive-search solution and too complex for algorithmic solution. (Author)",

        "description":"A research project built an author-controlled computer-assisted instruction (CAI) system to study ease-of-use factors in student-system, author-system, and programer-system interfaces. Interfaces were designed and observed in use and systematically revised. Development of course material by authors, use by students, and administrative tasks were integrated into one system whose nucleus was a display-based interactive author language (DIAL). The design permitted systematic language implementation and easy language modification and used a translator writing system (TWS) to generate compilers. Authoring by teachers required simplicity of the language and its operational environment. A measured high level of user acceptance proved the design to be sound, and a significant reduction  in authoring time was achieved. DIAL was observed to be a superior language, for machine intrusion was low and other syntactic improvements were possible. An answer-evaluating technique, called the sieve, was devised and a syntactically improved DIAL/2 language derived. The TWS helped to implement DIAL and to remediate language weaknesses. Although the TWS was not available for the command language of the operational environment, the human-factors debugging period revealed the desirability of such. (Author/PB)",

The hardware utilized included an IBM 2250 Display Unit Model 1 attached to an IBM Systems/360 Model 40 computer with 256K bytes of memory. Trial use  indicated that the system aided teaching; students reacted favorably, and they were able to complete the laboratory exercises. The system was easy to use and provided fast and reliable responses. Also, the interactive graphics display mode possessed additional advantages over drawings of distributions. These included: 1) the variation of parameters, thus allowing a huge number of displays; 2) superposition, to compare shapes of distributions; 3) zooming capability to allow variation of an abscissa or ordinate; 4) increased student motivation.

Gifted students in grades 4, 5, and 6 of a suburban district were given Guilford's tests of creativity and then divided into seven groups. Six of these watched a specific category of program for three weeks; the seventh served as a control group. The categories were: educational television, cartoons, sports, comedies, drama, and &quot;everything.&quot; Posttests were administered and analysis of variance used to measure the independent variable of sex, grade, and category of program viewed, and the dependent variable of change in creativity scores. The control group increased in creative ability, whereas the  experimental groups declined in all areas except for verbal abilities, although the decline was not statistically significant for most areas. Younger children were more affected than older ones, and sex was not a significant variable. Children watching dramatic shows increased in creative performance, while those watching cartoons and, surprisingly, educational programs had depressed creative scores. The results were interpreted as a serious warning that current television programing is detrimental to children's creativity. (Author/PB)",

        "description":"Research sought to develop a quantitative model for the prediction of learning effects of a bilingual children's educational television program. The stimulus program series consisted of 30 sessions of Carrascolendas, a Spanish-English series which was based on specified behavioral objectives and aimed at students through grade 2. Learning effects were measured with criterion referenced tests administered to 408 Mexican-American children. Data were collected on the independent variables of communication stimuli, individual characteristics, and contextual traits; the predictive models were based upon linear multiple regression analysis. Results showed that learning effects can be predicted with relatively high degrees of reliability and accuracy. From this it was concluded that  policy decisions regarding educational television must account for contextual characteristics, as well as program content and objectives, and that a communications stimulus, such as a television series, functions as one of many stimuli in producing learning effects. More detailed measures of these independent variables are needed and contracts for the evaluation of program series should require that measurement involve linear models. (LB)",

Phase I involves a pilot study and Phase II a full integration. The system employs interactive computer simulation to teach engineering concepts which are not well handled by traditional methods. It requires less mathematical sophistication of the student and provides him with a measure of control, but has the drawbacks of being less flexible and realistic than ordinary laboratory experiments. The ITCH approach provides graphic input and output and employs natural language dialogs. The hardware is based upon the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-8 line. Phase I software developments include the modification of a TSS/8  monitor and the design of instructional packages dealing with antennae Bode/Nyquist problems, point/line charges, Fourier problems, static fields transistors, root loci, phases and planes, linear filters, and amplifier design. Each package consists of a problem with appropriate inputs and outputs. Students specify parameters and request displays of results, thereby gaining insights into man-machine interactions and parameter-process relations. The packages developed to date are being tested with EE faculty and third year students. (LB)",

Core studies, the consideration of the theoretical fundamentals of modeling and simulation, and the execution by students of a project are employed. Taught in the Electrical Engineering Department at Michigan Technological University, the course is broadly based with regard to both subject matter and simulation methods, and students are free to select a project in any area and to use the computer and language of their choice. Societal, scientific, and engineering models are studied, and digital, analog, and hybrid computer simulations are considered. The course is intended to increase the students' awareness of the possibilities of quantizing problems  associated with dynamic systems and to inform them of the potentials of computer simulation. Design, rather than analysis, is emphasized and student projects aim at utilizing computer simulations to determine control strategies. Evaluation to date indicates that the course is both successful and popular, but also that students require additional training in generating project problems and in writing technical proposals.

Thirty-five science majors enrolled in the first quarter and 32 continued in the second term. The hardware for the course consists of a PDP-11/20 computer and eight teletype terminals; additional peripheral equipment includes a card reader, a card punch, a line printer, and two ports for phone lines. Core size is 7K but four discs contain 2.9 million words. Batch and conversational modes are possible in the system and the BASIC-PLUS language is used. Four categories of CAI activities are noteworthy. First, eight canned programs--LUNA, VECTOR, SEESAW, CAN, INCLIN, NEWTON, CIRSAT, and HARMOT--are used to teach units on vectors, statics, freefall and  projectile motion, mechanics, gravity, oscillations, and wave motions. Secondly, students write their own programs to solve problems. In addition, the computer is used to monitor tests, providing immediate feedback, allowing students to rework missed problems, reducing time pressures, and permitting limited self-pacing. Finally, computer graphics, utilizing a Tektronix 4010 graphic terminal, are being introduced into the course. (PB)",

        "description":"A study of programed instruction sought to establish an attribute by treatment interaction (ATI) between prior familiarity of material and response mode. Two experimental variables (familiarization and response mode) and two subject attributes (sex and I.Q.) were employed. Junior High (JH) and graduate student (GS) were assigned to familiarization (F) or non-familiarization (NF) groups, and to constructed response (CR) or reading (R) modes. The F group received advance familiarizing materials. Main effects for the college data were insignificant, but sex and I.Q. were significant for JH Students. There was ATI between familiarity and response mode. F. led to increased achievement for the R group, but to decreased achievement for the CR group. The familiarity-by-response mode  interaction was complicated by interacting with sex for GS and I.Q. for JH. Delayed posttest interactions were more significant than immediate results. The negative effect of F on CR achievement was felt due to lower motivation for able students to attend to familiar material. Sex results were explained by the hypothesis that passive females attend to all tasks, impulsive males only to interesting ones; thus F led to reduced male achievement. Increased retention over time was interpreted as reflecting that retention is a function of initial meaningful learning. (Author)",

Five major types of applications are postulated--laboratory tools, teaching support systems, teaching systems, learning systems, and tools for research. Laboratory tools include calculators and compilers. Teaching support systems aid the management of teaching and cover 1) teacher-oriented applications such as data banks, answer processors, statistical packages and test generators and 2) the  student-oriented applications of individual testing and computer-managed instruction. Teaching systems are those in which the computer is the main support of information; drill and practice and computer-assisted tutorials are the major applications found under this rubric. Simulations and inquiry dialogues are subsumed under learning systems, while in the final category, research tools, are activities such as course and test validation and the development of learning models.

It measures the observed experiences and the desired experiences of students on 61 dimensions of teacher-student relationships, using a five-point scale. The difference between observed and desired responses provides an indication of student dissatisfaction. The test was administered to 35 secondary students who had taken a CAI course in data processing. Results indicated that student-machine interaction needed to be made more rapid and flexible and  that machine failure could be reduced. In addition, it was found that the measuring scales needed improvement and that test modules should be constructed so that it would be possible to adapt situation specific instruments to appropriate contexts.

The goals of such instruction are to: 1) teach basic skills in language arts, math, science, and social studies; 2) develop higher cognitive abilities, such as problem solving; and 3) develop the child's social competence and self-concept. Open, individualized education assumes that learning should be an active, interesting process in a free environment which is self-managed by the learner, with the teacher acting as a facilitator. The system begins by positing educational objectives and uses student learning plans in which pupils choose learning activities. Learning materials are adapted for individual use in a flexible room whose foci are learning centers for language arts, math and science, and  arts and crafts. Media are regarded as essential to the program. The teacher's role changes as he spends less time in group instruction and more in adapting instructional materials for individual activities, and as he learns new ways of relating to students. Children are required to become more responsible, active, cooperative, self-disciplined, and self-evaluative. Lastly, the program is mastery-oriented, for students work at projects at varying paces until mastery is achieved. (PB)",

The rationale for the programs is based upon the belief that computer-assisted instruction (CAI) can improve education by, among other things, freeing teachers from routine tasks, measuring entry skills, presenting appropriate material, and conducting simulations. Thus, more flexible, individualized instruction is created. Program development proceeds by breaking a course into units, specifying performance objectives, defining instructional sequences, coding the lesson into computer language and entering it into the machine, debugging it, running a pilot test, and implementing the final version. Programing strategies generally recommend  pleasurable interactive sessions of from 20 to 45 minutes. Objectives are specified and then attained through tutorial drill, laboratory simulation, or synthesis programs. A control-experimental design is used for evaluation, with data being compared via techniques such as regression analysis and analysis of variance. Finally, student attitudes toward CAI are checked.

        "description":"The results of a survey of cable television (CATV) and related technological industries are summarized. In this, the first of a series of seven reports, attention is focused upon some major technical factors which need to be considered in order that a transition from the technical state of today's cable television and services to new teleservices may be effected. The relationship between systems and teleservices is explored and technical summaries are presented in the areas of measurements, standards or engineering practices, new applications of technology, system design analysis, software, and teleservices. The ensuing volumes will discuss: subscriber terminals and network interface (volume 2), signal transmission and delivery between head-end and subscriber terminals (volume  3), system control facilities (volume 4), system interconnections (volume 5), and the use of computers in CATV two-way communications systems (volume 6). The last report in the series will consist of a selected bibliography. (Author/PB)",

        "description":"Research tested an anxiety reduction technique in a computer-based learning situation. Computer-based situations were used because they permitted controlled studies using materials relevant to the real-life needs of students and allowed repeated measurements of state anxiety in response to learning materials. Thus, the relationships between anxiety reduction and subsequent state anxiety and that between state anxiety and performance could be uncovered. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used, following several tests of its reliability and validity. Since previous studies did not directly measure state anxiety, but rather inferred it from behavioral or performance indexes, a new paradigm was developed to study the mutual effects of state anxiety, cognitive abilities, and  experimental treatments on a concept learning task. An experimental group received memory support when requested; two control groups received it, respectively, continuously, or never. Results from the MA-3 Associative Memory Test showed that the experimental group required fewer trials to criterion and had lower levels of anxiety. Thus, directly measured evidence was offered for the contention that the anxiety reduction treatment of memory support reduced state anxiety. (PB)",

        "description":"An automated program for the reduction of test anxiety in a computer-based learning situation has been developed. Its main components are: 1) a self-study manual containing information and written exercises dealing with coping with test anxiety; 2) a videotape of modeled effective and ineffective coping with anxiety on tests; 3) a brief, modified systematic desensitization procedure; and 4) a session of practicing coping with anxiety in a computer-guided testing situation. The objective was to provide an inexpensive service for test-anxious students. Preliminary investigation of the program's effectiveness in the context of a sequence of computer-managed instructional modules found a highly significant reduction in self-reported test anxiety as compared with a no-contact control  group of highly test-anxious students. Slight indications of improved performance on the modules for the treatment groups were also noted. Future research will be directed at overcoming difficulties in detecting improved performance following reduction of test anxiety and toward eliminating the relaxation and desensitization component of the program in favor of increased emphasis upon practicing test-taking and anxiety management skills.

This paper proposes a way of resolving the problems of determining what is grammatically necessary as a sound basis of all language use and what constitutes a speaker's communicative competence. The framework is organized in notional categories. By considering first what the content of utterances is likely to be, it is possible to decide which forms of language will be most valuable. If it is assumed that most learners will need to express a similar range of content, it becomes possible to set up comparable syllabuses for different languages. The notional information is then supplemented by  information concerning obligatory grammatical categories not predictable from the notional approach. A number of detailed examples are given of the varied ways in which some of the functional categories are expressed in English. The appendix contains a section which exemplifies the categories of communicative function. (Author/RL)",

The following program suggestions are based on an arrangement that has been used under a variety of conditions: divide program into 3 main parts--(1) preliminary instruction to teach the simple use of a compass; (2) compass games; and (3) pointing up the general program--that is, a compass hike combining various outdoor skills into a unified adventure. There are no real limitations  regarding the area to be used. A small back yard or even indoor rooms are usable.

This study expanded this empirical literature by assessing the nature of the athletic participation and educational aspiration relationship for a sample of rural, white male athletes in the deep South (Louisiana). Group interviews were conducted at 24 high schools, resulting in a final sample of 3,245 youths. Complete data on all variables included in this study were secured for 884 white males. The findings suggested that participation in interscholastic high school athletics is moderately related to level of educational aspiration for both rural  and urban youths. The results from a series of partial correlations suggested that a substantial portion of the original educational aspiration-athletic participation relationship was due to the influence of parents' education and students' academic performance. Additional regression and covariance analyses revealed that athletic participation had relatively the weakest effects of all predictor variables within each residence category and that this rather weak effect was comparable for each residence category. Statistical tables were also presented. (FF)",

These schools were located in 13 randomly selected rural parishes (counties) in the state. The sample of 544 youths interviewed in 1968 consisted of 88 black males, 126 black females, 171 white males, and 159 white females. Findings showed that the majority of these rural youths aspired and expected to live in residential areas and did not anticipate residential goal deflection in 1968. By 1972, over 61% of them had migrated from their home  communities, mostly to urban destinations. Significant race and sex differences were found in the residential status projections, although only race differences were statistically significant in migration performances. Proportionately more blacks than whites, and more females than males, aspired as well as expected to live in the cities. The study concluded that residential aspirations, expectations and strength of goal deflection of rural youths at the time of high school graduation were generally poor/weak indicators of future geographic mobility patterns and residential status attainment.

Previous theoretical and empirical work was reviewed and a recursive model developed based on 8 hypotheses involving aggregate measures of socioeconomic origin index as an exogenous variable, achievement motivation, and anticipatory occupational success as the ultimate dependent variable. The conceptual model was empirically tested using a sample of black and white, male and female high school seniors from Louisiana in the winter of 1969 (1,070 white females, 332 black females, 1,087 white males, and 226 black males). Stratification was imposed by school size (large-small), school type (public-parochial), residential location (rural-urban), and race (black-white). Analysis  results indicated the hypothesis critical to the model was generally supported for the total sample, race, sex and race by sex subsamples. A notable exception to this was the finding that socioeconomic origins do not predict achievement motivation. The findings suggested that concept anticipatory success and the models were sufficiently promising to warrant further research but conclusions as to the validity and generalizability of either must be held in abeyance pending future research.

It attempted to determine what actually happens to village adolescents in different high school programs, why it happens, and what, if anything, can be done about it. Research methods studied the effects of 3 types of high school programs on 105 village freshmen who entered the programs over their freshmen and sophomore high school years. A follow-up study was also done on the 175 students who graduated from these programs from 1970-72. The programs studied were: rural boarding home (Bethel), boarding school (Beltz), and urban boarding home (Anchorage). It was found that these programs created serious social and emotional problems among village students without teaching  them the skills necessary to succeed as adults. The majority of the students either dropped out of school or else transferred from school to school. The educational benefits of a large high school with a variety of courses and specialized teachers did not materialize for most village students. Policy recommendations were: (1) high school programs should be established in home villages; (2) boarding home and dormitory programs should be closed in those towns with high levels of social problems; (3) public boarding schools should be closed; (4) the urban boarding home program should remain open to those village students whose educational needs cannot be met in a village school; and (5) the State Department of Education should establish a village high school development program.

Although much has been written about the Indians and the Federal Government, there has been limited attention given to the relationship of the Indian with local and State governments. The document attempts to remedy this by giving special attention to Indian, local, and State governmental relationships as well as the role of Federal Government. All of the States were canvassed to obtain their statutes, executive orders, and special organizational arrangements for their Indian citizens. Also, a questionnaire was circulated to obtain the attitudes of tribal chairmen towards services from the local, State, and Federal  Government. The book raises questions and issues, and offers alternatives and recommendations which should be discussed and evaluted by future leaders, especially in terms of the relationship of the Indian and his government to non-Indian society. The book may be of interest to Indian leaders; local, State, and Federal executive and legislative officials; and students of federalism in general.

        "description":"The Food and Nutrition Program for Aged (FNPA) was established as 1 of 30 research and demonstration programs funded through the provisions of the \"Older Americans Act\" to promote improved nutrition among aged groups. In the first 3-year phase, the program concentrated on the delivery of nutritional services, and the development and demonstration of an educational program for good nutrition. In its last year, the main concern of FNPA was to expand its program of nutritional education to a larger segment of the target population through the use of Community Nutrition Aides (CNA), who were members of the target group. This paper, reflecting evaluation research of an FNPA program aimed at a rural Black aged population, contained: (1) a brief description of the program; (2) a review  of research procedures; and (3) a synthesized presentation of major outcomes. The 20 unpaid Aides were evaluted for knowledge of program purpose and goals, nature of home visits to clients, nutritional related factors, and supportive services. The evaluation presented evidence that the program had a keen effect on the lives and general well-being of the Aides. The greatest benefit of the program might be the reciprocal rewards of the relationships established between the Aides and their clients. The 3 implications for social action programs covered such things as methodologies, program effectiveness, and evaluation procedures. (KM)",

One of the major gaps in rural development research seems to be the lack of problem definition. The current numerous agencies, research documents, and researchers involved in the rural development effort are too complex to allow for an organized approach. If the  rural development effort is to produce the desired results, the economist's approach, which appeals for a study of the resources of the rural community to analyze the alternatives open for economic development and to make recommendations on public policy at the local, state, and national levels, must assume much greater importance, and rural development researchers must be more clearly attuned to needs. Agricultural economists should direct their attention to research designed to provide information which will speed up rural economic development, providing jobs and income. (KM)",

The major hypotheses tested was that respondents affected more by adverse social factors and situational conditions will develop less positive work orientations. Data were obtained from a July 1971 rural manpower survey conducted in 3 low-income counties of south central Virginia. A combination of systematic and stratified sampling was employed. A total of 713 surveys were conducted, covering 2 separate lists of residents in each county: the general population of heads of households, and welfare recipients. The dependent variable of work orientation attitude was measured by 4 tests: (1) life aspirations; (2)  work ethic; (3) lack of confidence; and (4) acceptability of welfare. The independent variables were categorized as: (1) life style variables; (2) situational variables; and (3) attitudinal variables. Findings suggested that many persons affected by adverse social problems and situational conditions in fact are willing to work and do have a relatively positive outlook on life. Findings also suggested that some of those who are on welfare do not wish to remain on welfare. The 7 conclusions and recommendations covered such areas as broadening existing work incentives and improving living conditions. (KM)",

Studying the effects of variables in the adolescent experience upon access to success, this investigation examined 3 aspects of adolescence--school status, peer group involvement, and official delinquency. The data were abstracted from the Marion County Youth Study, an ongoing longitudinal panel study of adolescent males in western Oregon. School status was indicated by the respondent's cumulative grade point average. Peer group involvement was indicated by the respondent's estimate of the average number of hours spent with friends during the week. The last independent variable, delinquency, was obtained from court  records. The 2 measures of access to success--educational attainment and adult socioeconomic status--were obtained from questionnaires. Conclusions indicated that the school procedures and policies themselves may well have an effect upon an adolescent's commitment to conventional success, although peer group involvement did not affect access to adult success as expected. Lastly, the delinquency label seemed to be part of the institutional build up of labels that often begins with labels about academic ability. (FF)",

The U.S. Government has excercised plenary power over Indians for approximately 200 years. Indian tribes have traditionally been viewed by Federal courts as dependent or tributary nations possessed of limited elements of sovereignty and requiring Federal protection. Congress has alternatively viewed tribes as sovereign political entities or as anachronisms which must eventually be extinguished. The result has been 2 conflicting Federal policies--separation and assimilation. The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 made all Indians born in the U.S. citizens of  the U.S. As such, they are also citizens of the State in which they live, even though they may reside on a reservation. Indians are therefore citizens of 3 separate political entities, subject to Federal laws, civil and criminal laws of the tribe when they are on the reservation and within its jurisdiction, and State laws while off the the reservation. This document presents a general study of the constitutional status of Indians, rather than a complete analysis of the unique and complex field of Federal Indian law. (FF)",

The local Agency offices of the Bureau of Indian Affiars estimated the figures using whatever information is available.

Estimates of approximately 38,000 rural Indians living in California counties containing Indian trust land are also included.

The frustrations of Indian people became evident in each of the separate responses of the Indians in the various seminars, speeches, presentations, art exhibits, etc., and in the total realm of the various activities at this conference and the 2 Indian education workshops for non-Indian teachers. The first workshop, held in October 1971, focused on the historical and cultural aspects of Indian education. The second (February 1972) included a visit by the class of  teachers to reservations within San Diego County. The information in this handbook, complete with useful appendices (e.g., Indian resource people) should serve as a model to both Indian and non-Indian communities. The 6 goals of these workshops were to (1) define and outline the needs of Indian education to participants; (2) assess the current status of projects implemented over the past 4 years in Indian education; (3) stimulate a positive commitment for action from the participants on behalf of achieving stated goals; (4) provide opportunities for broadened awareness through experimental learning; (5) stress a viable Indian culture; and (6) provide a continuation of opportunities for the participants' further development.

The program, a part of the California Plan for the Education of Migrant Children (Title I, Elementary and Secondary Education Act), used 2 different approaches to provide these services to the second through eighth grade students. Group 1 used the team teaching approach, with trained tutors under the direction of the classroom teacher. A resource teacher gave support and continued inservice training to both the teacher and the tutor. Children in group 2 received services from the several school districts where they were enrolled. The districts provided \"pull out\" programs in\"language development\", remedial reading, and English as a second language and were reimbursed for the costs of the services rendered. The cost per child in each program was comparable, but test results showed an important difference in gain scores. Group 1 children met the program objective of at least 1 month of gain on a standardized test for each month in the program, while group 2 did not. Since per pupil costs were the same, it was concluded that the team teaching approach was several times as cost effective as the reimbursement approach. (KM)",

The Task Force's first report deals with Alberta's Native peoples. The assignment was to collect and summarize data to be used by the government as a basis for establishing policies and practices that will serve the educational needs of cultural minorities, such as Native Americans and Hutterites. Data used by the Task Force were drawn from other sources. Chapter I uses literature from the social sciences to gain a theoretical understanding of what happens when cultures meet. Chapter II brings together statistics from a variety of sources to numerically define the current status of Native education in Alberta. Chapter III draws upon the works of many  authors to explain the effects of education on the psychological, sociological, and cultural welfare of Native peoples. Chapter IV summarizes submissions made by Native groups in order to determine what Native peoples want. Chapter V reviews efforts that are being made to meet these wants and needs. The final chapter suggests some tentative policies and procedures which might be considered and put into practice. There were certain limitations in the preparation of this study--e.g., adult education for Native peoples was regarded as the legitimate domain of the Department of Advanced Education and was therefore omitted.

The discussion included: (1) obtaining the sample, (2) sample description, (3) reasons for living off-reserve, (4) employment opportunities, (5) income and poverty line, and (6) academic achievement. A total of 1,095 persons interviewed constituted a 1-in-6 sample of B.C. status Indians (age 16-55) who reside off-reserve. A total of 54 towns were represented in the survey. It appeared that, until high school graduation is achieved, additional years of education have little effect in reducing the Indian unemployment rate. There is a significantly lower unemployment rate among Indians who were members of a union. Some 58.2% of non-metro families and unattached individuals had  incomes of less than $4,000, while 39.5% of the metro families and unattached individuals had a range of $4,000-$7,999. The poverty rate of B.C. Indians off-reserve in 1970 was 2-1/2 times the rate for all Canadians. One quarter of the sample had completed the 6th grade or less and only 1/6 completed high school or better. Some reasons for living off-reserve were employment, housing shortage on reserve, and preferring living off-reserve. Findings were also presented in tables. (FF)",

The thrust of the program ranged from creating awareness of and interest in good teaching practices to helping instructors implement these practices in their own classrooms. Building on another ESEA Title III program, planners designed the Upper Cumberland Reading Project to: (1) address the needs of 13 Appalachian countries in Tennessee; (2) demonstrate teaching methods which could be used with basal programs and in self-contained classrooms; (3) require no expenditures for materials or equipment; (4) demonstrate approaches for teaching reading which could be used after the project ended. The actual exchange  program had 3 stages: (1) itinerant teachers from the 2 exchange centers spend 1 day visiting participating teachers; (2) during the next 5 days, participating teachers visited the 2 demonstration schools; and (3) on the last 2 days of an exchange, participants returned to their own schools and worked with the ESEA Title III itinerant teachers to implement instructional practices observed at the centers. The 5 findings, measured by the Stanford Achievement Test, indicated that the ESEA Title III pupils made significantly greater gains in reading than did control pupils. (KM)",

A proportionate, stratified, random cluster sample of Louisiana high school seniors was selected in November 1970, yielding a total of 3,245 respondents. High schools within the state were stratified on the basis of residence (rural-urban), school type (public-parochial), and school size (large-medium-small). Path analyses were conducted separately by residence and racial categories within residence. Within models by specific control categories the path coefficients revealed that the 3 social status variables were rather weak predictors of academic performance,  while academic performance manifested the strongest independent effects on occupational plans. A comparison of models across control categories was made utilizing path regression coefficients. The findings of this analysis indicated that, comparatively, father's education had the strongest impact on occupational plans for all control categories. The effect of this variable was substantially less for rural black respondents. These findings and others were discussed along with proposals for future research in this general area. (Author/KM)",

Follow-up activities used with subgroups of students included (1) discussion of multiple-choice questions distributed prior to the film, (2) group discussion led by the investigator, (3) discussion led by classroom teachers, and (4) no activity. The pre-test instrument was used to post-test all students included in the study. Attitudes of students in all experimental groups changed favorably from pre-test to post-test. Only the groups using the multiple-choice  questions and those participating in investigator-led discussions showed significant gains over the groups which had not seen the films. The group using multiple-choice questions showed the most significant gain. There was no significant relationship between attitudes investigated and (1) grade level, (2) mental age, (3) mean and science achievement test scores, (4) sex, (5) parents' science backgrounds, and (6) economic status.

Shortcomings in current teacher preparation are discussed in connection with recent changes in the economy and society. Professional aspects of science teaching are described as the main concern in the future teacher preparation program. Educational objectives should be directed toward the understanding of (1) the changing character of science, (2) the place of science in society, (3) the nature of knowledge in science, (4) the learning of science based knowledge, (5) the philosophical basis of science education and the rationale for curriculum  choices, and (6) the valuation of goals and similar topics. Capability of generating insights into problems of teaching and knowledge in liberal arts and humanities are also required. Great efforts and support from outside disciplines are needed to help beginning teachers gain a personal sense of purpose and direction and a basis for intelligent action. Science teachers' responsibility as consumers of education research rather than as researchers is stressed. The author indicates that \"new\" science teacher education is likely to be formulated by teacher educators rather than by forces outside the profession. (CC)",

Behaviorism is thought of as serving only the function of discipline-oriented curricula. Difficulties with teacher preparation result from a lack of awareness of the cultural need served by education. A science teacher has the responsibility of helping the students develop the plasticity and adaptability to fulfill their function in the society of tomorrow. Science teacher education should emphasize: (1) the human qualities, such as freedom, choice, self-evaluation, and self-realization, essential for self-actualization, (2) the analytic and synthetic nature and the self-correcting attributes of science, and (3)  the understanding of science as a cultural product.

The model is characterized by the approach of unified activities and includes three components: a preservice program, an inservice program, and a student teaching experience. Team teaching of science and mathematics courses is the major portion of the preservice program, with emphases upon problem solving activities, philosophical orientation, and Piagetian studies. Social studies and language arts are equally required for the teacher candidate. The inservice component is carried out through master teachers and supportive staff. Development of teaching strategies and a tolerance to allow preservice teachers to try various approaches for inservice  teachers is the main concern. Student teaching takes place under the supervision of master teachers and college supervisors. Attempts to match student teachers with master teachers are found to be effective. Arrangements of teacher preparation experiences in the integrated preservice-inservice approach are concluded as unique. Further modifications are recommended on the extension of the student teaching period and adoption of a clinical approach. (CC)",

Because the literature in recreational mathematics has proliferated to amazing proportions since Volume 2 of this series (ED 040 874), Volume 3 is more than just an updating of the earlier monographs. The overall organization of the book has been retained, although there has been a notable rearrangement of subtopics in the interest of economy and clarity. Major changes include (1) the addition of two new sections on classroom games and recreational activities which will be quite useful for teachers; (2) a chronological synopsis of Martin Gardner's popular column in Scientific American; and (3) a glossary of terms related  to recreational mathematics. The main topic headings are: Arithmetic Recreations; Number Theory as Recreation; Geometric Recreations; Topological Recreations; Magic Squares and Related Configurations; Pythagorean Recreations; Recreations in Antiquity; Combinatorial Recreations; Manipulative Recreations; and Mathematics in Related Fields.

For this purppse it was compared with several other variables as predictors of success in the specific courses; passing was considered success in a course. The other variables gathered were: number of high school mathematics units; high school class rank (HSR); and the verbal, mathematics (SAT-M) and total scores of the CEEB Scholastic Aptitude Tests. The sample consisted of students in one of seven different beginning mathematics courses offered by Indiana University. Based on several multiple regression analyses, it was concluded that the  combination of SAT-M and HSR was the most efficacious predictor of success. More specific results for particular courses and different combinations of predicotr variables are reported with complete statistical results provided in the appendix of this document. (JP)",

The second section deals with research on teaching involving the systematic observation of classroom behavior. Documents published or made available between 1960 and 1971 are reviewed, with an emphasis on studies dealing with teacher behavior in science classrooms. The third portion of the monograph examines teacher behavior studies in fields other than science education. Common findings emerging from the research reviewed in this section  indicate that teachers dominate classroom talk, and students seldom initiate verbal interaction. Each section includes a summary discussion, a set of recommendations that should be valuable in guiding future research in the area of teacher behavior, and an extensive bibliography of the studies reviewed. In all, over 1,300 research studies relating to teacher behavior are listed in the bibliographies. (JR)",

Curriculum development based on the disciplines facilitates content selection and cooperation with scientists and is compatible with the training of teachers and public expectancies. A reception psychology of learning parallels the structure of knowledge as a guide to measuring the facilitative effects of disciplined learning. The present trend toward non-cognitive approaches under the rubrics of relevance and problems is self-defeating because it neglects the establishment of orderly and systematic habits of thought. The schools' role is development of literacy and transmission of culture embedded in the rudiments of  formal knowledge; thus schools provide foundations for professional training as well as transmission of culture for the masses. A social problems approach to social studies curricula does not transmit knowledge, confuses the role of political action with schooling, and provides a simplistic approach to the solution of complex problems. Curriculum is and ought to continue to be a translation of theoretical knowledge based upon the separate disciplines. (Author/JH)",

The Team conducted basic research to discover, document and illuminate the issues of racism and control of youth which appear as the major institutional conditions leading to educational failure and political crisis in schools. It also conducted a variety of developmental programs to generate alternative models of aspects of secondary education and to design new materials and resources  helpful in the change process. A series of regional consultant teams were identified and trained to provide direct assistance to school systems in crisis (Network on Educational Unrest). Further, the ECT trained groups of students, teachers, administrators, and community members in new ways of dealing with school conflicts, and created and disseminated various materials pertinent to school crisis and change. Relevant publications available by or from the ECT, a bibliography of school conflict and change, and a list of Team staff members are included in the report. (Author/KSM)",

The rationale for violence varies: Marcuse suggests that government, law and order, are disguised forms of violence; Fanon regards violence as a necessary act of cleansing and self restoration; psychiatrists Laing and Cooper view society as violence but do not see violence as an end in itself. The need to transcend personal anxieties, making use of such rationale, acts along with the rationale itself to erupt both collectively and publicly. The possibility of violence appears contingent upon the strength of the assumptions that specific aims are not subject to compromise and that moderate tacticsare too slow, or upon the agents of  social control responding to or initiating violence. The vast supply of literature on student unrest allows for exploration of the interplay between intra-university and national issues and the overlap between the cultural and personality elements. Books by W.S. Bakke, Edward Shils, Raymond Boudon, S.M. Lipset and others including various American surveys like the Kerner Report show where these contingencies have resulted in violence. (JH)",

The survey of 1973, a four-page questionnaire, was mailed to 409 schools and gathered 218 responses. A description of the results analyzes and compares data collected in the following areas: which schools taught separate psychology courses, number of students enrolled, school and class characteristics, length of courses, popularity of psychology, student demand, certification and preparation of teachers, type of approach used, course objectives, what topics are included and what topics should be included, and needs for new materials and materials now in use. Three concluding suggestions are that psychology as an  instructional discipline for high school requires further definition, that more consideration should be given to the clientele, and that teacher qualifications and certification requirements need description. A brief review of the literature concludes with 19 characteristics of the status of pre-college psychology. A list of periodicals and journals and an appendix with data in tabular form are followed by references. The 1970-71 survey is ED 073 026. (KSM)",

        "description":"Drawing on implications suggested by several recent studies in comparative urban research, the extent to which the structure of intergovernmental relations affects the allocations of public funds within a nation is examined. The focus is on educational policy and determining whether differing degrees of centralization affect the outcomes of the policy process. Five hypotheses were tested with nation-level data for 17 countries in Europe and North America and with subnational data for four federal and four nonfederal systems. A systematic difference was found between the federal and the non-federal systems in policy performance, with little indication that federal systems either equalize or redistribute the aggregate resources of society, perpetuating the regional disparities.  While it seems true that the dominant role of the central government in a non-federal system may reduce the magnitude of intra-national variation of education spending, it is nevertheless evidenced that the aggregate allocation of funds to education relative to resource base is highest in the federal nations. Appendices present factor structures for dimensions of industrialization and commercialization for 16 nations, and factor structures for dimensions of industrialization and integration of four non-federal and four federal nations.

        "description":"The means and advantages of incorporating participation experiences into an instructional program to promote the development of effective student participant roles are presented in this paper. Several alternative approaches are reviewed historically and three types--observer, action, and competency--are discussed. A rationale for a competency-based approach is explained as one in which students gain basic political knowledge through a framework which compares and explains common political experiences; basic intellectual skills are gained through participation in class and school activities; and participation competenceis are developed through continuous activities in school political life. Such a program, Comparing Political Experiences, is described as developed by the High  School Political Science Curriculum Development Project at Indiana University. The goal of this program, social self-fulfillment, the underlying assumptions, and implications are reviewed. These assumptions and evidence to support them generate an argument for this approach to social studies education which is diagrammed and summarized. The conclusion traces the argument, points out further problems and prospects, and confirms this program as a means to constructively advocate participation without promoting particular political structures, roles, or issue positions.

        "description":"Outward Bound is an educational experience of self-discovery that uses challenges found in a natural setting as the teaching medium. Program adaptations of Outward Bound concepts and methods for alternative education fall into five categories: 1) motivational programs, 2) human relations programs within a school, 3) alternatives to traditional physical education, 4) curriculum enrichment, and 5) faculty development. Six descriptions of programs in New Jersey, Colorado, and Massachusetts illustrate these categories. Incorporating Outward Bound in schooling processes places strains upon finances, school administrations, and teaching faculties; moreover, activities are sometimes dangerous, represent a conflicting educational philosophy, and can create an exclusive group within a  school. Documentation and follow-up research of programs exists but is limited; nevertheless it is clear that such programs can reach a wide cross section of students in a personal way, that faculty respond with as much enthusiasm as students, and that better communications and human relations develop when Outward Bound is the catalyst between disparate groups. ED 061 160 is a related document. (Author/JH)",

The course content is divided into three areas: first, human evolution and its corresponding cultural and demographic factors; second, man's existence in relation to environmental factors and economic considerations; third, political activities and practical methods for limiting population, including moral and ethical considerations. Educators in population should realize that they are committed to  changing values as well as clarifying them. The incorporation of population education in our schools is a particular goal for that reason.

The author hypothesizes that in a tribal society, the hidden curriculum will function in the form of tribal initiation to inculcate an egalitarian consciousness and that in a chiefdom it will function as a secret society that will articulate individuals on the basis of social differentiation; thus, the contrasting aspects of the institutions are seen to be indicative of the type of societal organization. In the stratified state with a formal class structure articulation of individuals would be  determined initially by birth and later by various secondary mechanisms of a limited, nonsecret nature. The formal hypotheses drawn from these ideas are borne out by the research study. Correlation coefficients between the variables for the study are found in an appendix. (JH)",

Three hypotheses tested are 1) that children will have cultural mappings (systems of codes for perception and action) that differ from adults; 2) that children at different ages will show a development in the complexity of these rules; and 3) that this development will be in the direction of the rules held by those who have a stable and consistent pattern of effectively structured encounters with the children. The outline of the findings focuses on the development of selected dimensions of the work domain found in children in a suburban elementary school from ages 5 to 12 using a picture-sorting technique. Cultural premises of work  held by children and adults are stated. It is shown that children and adults who share the same cultural premise about work have used that premise to construct different work protocols. Young children seem to use principles that are unidimensional and perceptionally concrete, while adults have categories that are complex, multidimensional and perceptually abstract. The development in complexity for children is toward the adult principles. The findings demonstrate that children have principles of cognitive mapping that are internally consistent and different from those of adults. (Author/KSM)",

        "description":"This report investigated the effect of Kazanjian Foundation Award Programs for Teaching Economics (KFAP) on elementary school children, grades four through six. The research was designed around three groups -- users of Kazanjian materials with teacher training, without teacher training, and users of normal curriculum materials. Teacher training consisted of a five-week summer session using four randomly selected KFAP units with follow-up during the school year. Student progress was measured by pre and post instruction use of the Test of Elementary Economics and pre instruction use of the John Flanagan Test of General Ability. Teacher progress was measured by pre and post instruction use of the Test of Elementary Economics and pre instruction use of the Test of Economic  Understanding (TEU). After statistical analysis, the data indicated a significant contribution to the understanding of economic concepts and practices among elementary students by Kazanjian materials. Moreover, training of the teachers gave students a comparative advantage. Teacher competency in economics measured on the TEU also contributed to improved student performance. The results reinforced continuation of the Kazanjian program and suggested the usefulness of further follow-up research. (JH)",

The general purpose of the case studies is to achieve more understanding of the change process in education in relation to political, administrative, organisational and educational dimensions. The research approach involves a study of innovations at the central, regional, and school levels of the educational system. Volumes I, II and III of this series present the case studies. The first and second chapters of this fourth volume establish the theoretical framework of the study. Chapters III, IV and V review the reports and examine certain aspects in the descriptions of  each of the institutions at each level in an attempt to identify common or contrasting features. Chapter VI looks at educational innovation from the individual's point of view. Alternative roles of research in educational innovation are explored in Chapter VII. Chapter VIII examines some of the factors explaining barriers and unintended effects in innovation. Chapter IX synthesizes findings to use them as a basis for discussion about roles and functions of different institutions at various levels in the educational system. Annex I lists the location and researcher for each of the case studies; Annex II presents a draft of the revised guidelines for the case studies. (KSM)",

Its place in curriculum can emerge from an exploration of the following questions: To what extent can we identify and describe a distinct affective curriculum? Should it be encouraged and disseminated? Can it succeed as an established movement? Interviews with three educators, a university staff member, a director of an alternative school, and an elementary school curriculum specialist, all advocating and working within an affective approach in education, were the means for discovering the actual role of affective education in curriculum. The interviewees responded to inquiries about the sources  in literature for their programs, their goals for students, their view of affect as an end or as a means in curriculum, the state of being of their curriculum, their preparation of teachers, and evaluation or observations of their programs. With the exception of the curriculum specialist, who had well thought-out-curriculum materials, the interviewees had little to contribute toward defining the role of the affective domain in curriculum, casting doubt on the success of the affective movement.

Introductory remarks by the series editor emphasize the importance of a debriefing session to allow the relationship of simulation and learning objectives to be assimilated. In this case study, the game is used as a tool to reinforce economic concepts studies taught previously through reading assignments from \"American Capitalism\" by Laurence Leamer and Dorothy Thompson. The beginning level of the game, \"Production, and Consumption,\" includes the three economic roles of worker, farmer, and manufacturer, for which the students divide into three, eight man groups and play for three class periods. The excerpted reactions, part of a fourth class  period devoted to debriefing, cover the purpose of the games, what was learned, problems encountered, and recommendations for future use. The teacher feels that the game makes concepts concrete, fulfilling his objectives to develop an understanding of supply and demand, price determination, the interrelationship of different roles in society, and the effect of collective action.

The major objectives of the training program were as follows: 1) to provide a combination of unique social experiences to high ability students which would be sufficiently challenging to motivate them toward commitment to advanced training and careers in the social sciences; 2) to introduce students to the scientific process as applied to social science investigation; and 3) to provide students the opportunity to engage in an independent research project. Guest lecturers discussed their own research findings during the initial two week segment and provided the students with the foundations of social science methodology. During the second 2-week  segment, students were offered their choice of five of seven modules, each 3 days in length, in political science, sociology, and psychology. Attempts were made by the instructor in each module to illustrate the application of social science methods to the various substantive areas. Several field trips were also taken during this time. The final two weeks of the institute were spent on individual research with staff supervision and assistance. Evaluations showed that the concept of the Institute was useful and that the program was successful in meeting its objectives. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"The geography of education is a field which is generally neglected by geographers, despite the large number involved in education. This paper offers a conceptual framework for such studies emphasizing educational planning. Within the area of human geography are at least three possibilities for the geography of education: the geographical examination of factors underlying education, the examination of the spatial patterns of educational phenomena, and the role of education as a factor influencing the geographical patterns of other social and cultural phenomena. Though some work has been done in the first area by non-geographers, more could be done to relate the physical and human environment to educational phenomena. Analysis of spatial patterns of educational phenomena has just  begun. Patterning of education values, attitudes, and opportunities could produce valuable planning data. In the third area, research indicates that education effects human perception of the environment, which ultimately shapes that environment. There are vast implications here for economic considerations in educational planning. This conceptual outline should help to stimulate interest in the geography of education and educational planning.

Whenever a relationship exists between a statistical measure of education and a notion of welfare or well being it is called, for the purposes of this report, an indicator; i.e., it measures output or performance. In elaboration on possible goals of education, indicators have emerged &quot;naturally&quot; in this report. After a short introductory chapter, the second chapter discusses approaches and methods toward selection of goals, evaluation and construction of indicators. Possible  goal areas in education discussed in chapters 3-7 are &quot;Transmission of Knowledge and Skill,&quot;&quot;Education and the Economy,&quot;&quot;Equality of Educational Opportunity,&quot;&quot;Provisional Educational Services for Individual Requirements,&quot; and &quot;Education and the Quality of Life.&quot; These chapters make precise statements on the different emphases that are possible inside a general area and, within those &quot;subareas&quot;, discuss possible indicators and the assumptions required for their construction. When a specific indicator emerges from the consideration of goals, the policy implications of its variation are discussed. ED 069 018-ED 069 023 are related documents. (JH)",

        "description":"A review and discussion of the new social studies introduces the problem of whether nationalism and patriotism are \"closed areas\" or if an open examination of these areas is possible in the public schools. Two sets of hypotheses, one dealing with public school educators and the other with school-related groups, were tested by administration of a situational questionnaire in a New Jersey, K-12 suburban school district. Data from the study are presented in tabular form and analyzed. The major hypothesis, that there would be a significant difference in the perceptions of public school educators between what would occur and what should occur in situations involving aspects of nationalistic instruction, was confirmed. Analysis reveals that the teachers, though not administrators,  perceived the school as being less open or tolerant than it should be. The discussion section notes that the disparity between responses would and should indicate that the public school is not particularly hospitable to open inquiry in areas of nationalism and patriotism. It is concluded that if the new social studies is unable to engage in open, critical inquiry in areas fundamental to social studies education, then the prevalence of the traditional, nationalistic instruction will remain. References and an appendix of sample questionnaire items conclude the paper. (Author/KSM)",

        "description":"A concern with the interrelationship between the formal structure of the high school and the behavior of its continually changing participant constituency is manifested in this paper. The concepts of role theory, status, social organization, and hierarchical structures are discussed in their relation to a processual role model. Within this model, it is stressed that the organization of interest is not the formal organization of the school but the organization of behavior among participants in a social situation. This behavior is noted for its interactive nature, and is thought to be influenced but not determined by the formal organization of the school just as it is influenced but not determined by the extra-institutional norms and goals of the individual participants. The  statuses which the formal structure allocates to individuals in the high school situation vary with a series of formal rules, restrictions and obligations. These do not, it is pointed out, define what the individuals in fact will do in that formal status, but set up the parameters within which they may operate. These rules, restrictions and obligations are the components of what previously has been called \"role\" but is felt here to be more justifiably considered as constraints placed upon the individuals who occupy a particular formally defined status.

The first three days of the year-long course are used to identify leaders and to assign groups, numbering five to seven students. In addition to covering course materials, the first three weeks are employed in gaining insight into group processes through discussion, films, slides, overhead transparencies, and handouts. Starting with the fourth week of class, a cooperative group state of development is entered by having students take over the responsibility for forming groups and assigning themselves more specific roles, while the teacher participates as consultant and observer. Day to  day activities within this organizational structure include a day of preparation, three days of group work, and a day of evaluation. All group discussion of course content is based on the study of historical situations and social issues, drawing from textbooks, paper backs, films, and handouts. A questionnaire study of the students in this class and of a control class reveals that the group participation approach requires more effort on the student's part, increases peer group pressure, and results in higher attendance. Findings did not show an expected increase of confidence in handling interpersonal relationships. (KSM)",

In social studies the main focus is on environmental design and planning. In this ninth grade social studies unit, students explore some general concepts of culture through general readings. Then a more in-depth look at a city's relationship to culture is presented through the use of slides and literature. Next, students are introduced to specific aspects of urban design and begin a study of the home community. The culmination experience of the unit is a student activity project in which a specific aspect of University City  is chosen for redesign. Three student projects described focus on the zoo, adequate housing, and community worship facilities. At the completion of the projects, students present proposals to a review board composed of class members and moderating teacher for critical appraisal of functional and aesthetic factors of the plans. Student evaluation measures are included with each of the 19 lesson guides. Teachers' assessments, provided on a form at the end of each of four lessons, contribute to annual modification of the program. Instruction units for the entire Arts in General Education Project and the 19 lessons of &quot;Redesigning The Community&quot; are listed. (KSM)",

He tries to help students develop respect for themselves and others, expand their interest in life, overcome emotional and learning problems, clarify values, and develop positive attitudes. Donovan attacks problems on an individual basis, but his social studies unit on divorce grew from the realization that more than half of this students are affected by the lack of one or both parents. Developing the whole child, not dealing only with problems, is the purpose behind his attempts to develop self-esteem by providing low-risk challenges that lead to success. Getting along with others, good personal habits, and  widened horizons contribute to the development of the whole person too. Through dramatic projects, role playing, reading to first graders, and self-directed free time, Donovan tries to implement his goals. The child-centered approach used in his class may give other teachers ideas to adapt in their own classrooms. (JH)",

The purpose of the conference was to assess what already is known about China; to identify issues which might profitably be investigated by future visitors to China; and to encourage further interest in Chinese education among American educational organizations and specialists. Among the 30 participants were nine recent visitors to the People's Republic, other China scholars, secondary school educators, and representatives of professional education organizations. The opening presentation posed a series of questions dealing with the basic values of the Chinese educational system. Two brief presentations on the history and philosophy of twentieth century  Chinese education are reviewed. A recent visitor's impressions on administration, administrators, planning and funding, curriculum, students, and teachers in China are related. The conclusion notes that the session barely scratched the surface of China's formal education system, but did stimulate considerable thought about the role that education plays in Chinese society. An appendix contains suggestions for interviewers when visiting China and a long series of as yet unanswered questions on Chinese education. (Author/KSM)",

To standardize teaching conditions, a teaching \"game\" that simulated a dyadic teacher-student instructional situation was developed. The game had student, teacher, and curriculum components. Twenty experienced teachers (10 men and 10 women) and 12 individuals with no teaching experience (6 men and 6 women) participated. Each taught one\"student\" from each of four types classified on the basis of knowledge of subject matter (high or low) and learning ability (fast or slow). Analyses of variance showed significant differences in teaching behavior related to the student characteristics and to two teacher characteristics (teaching experience and sex). Inexperienced teachers emphasized statement of rules more than experienced teachers did. Women emphasized relationships underlying rules more than men did. Correlational analysis showed significant relationships between teaching behavior and teaching experience, sex, age, verbal ability, and field independence. (Author/DDO)",

Part I is a discussion of the parts of a theoretical system including primitives, concepts, postulates, thoerems, and hypotheses. Part II indicates that the primary functions of a theoretical system are to predict what kinds of data are needed to solve a problem and whether the data obtained are reasonable. In part II formal logical methods of the theoretical scientist are stated, including a) method of  definition, b) method of hypothesis, c) method of espistemic correlation, and d) method for verifying theories.

The relationships of previous instruction, cultural background, occupation, intelligence, sex, and reasoning habits to test scores of examinees are discussed. Studies of the effect on examinees of argument format, use of logical connectives, language inconsistencies, item difficulty levels, abstractness, and argumentative content are reviewed. Implications of this literature review are that future deductive reasoning ability measurement devices should a) include provisions for assessing decisions involving both valid and invalid principles of reasoning; b) measure decisions for each structural type of  logical argument; c) utilize premises which are properly qualified, consistent with generally accepted facts, and constructed of neutral components; d) utilize standardized logical connectives; and e) measure the emotional effect of arguments on respondees.

        "description":"This document reports an attempt to examine the content and structure of the domain of research and development (R&D) training resources. The project began by locating instructional materials within a larger matrix that classified R&D resources by structure (primary/secondary, oral/written, documentary/non-document) and level of formalization (formal, semiformal, informal), and content (instructional/non-instructional material). Examination of ERIC, \"Books in Print,\" and three nonbook instructional materials collections indicated that there is roughly an \"order of magnitude\" ratio for the estimated quantities in these three bases. Extrapolation suggests that 90% of the educational R&D instructional resources are largely informal and fugitive. Perhaps 10% reach a semiformal level  where they may be in published form and may be referenced. Possibly only one or two percent are published commercially in hard cover, and much less than one percent are subjected to the test of the R&D development cycle. Probably over 95% of all instructional materials are in printed rather than oral form. The number of fully developed and tested materials is probably well under 100 items; perhaps another 1000 items have undergone minimal development and informal testing or evaluation. The number of books and textbooks with reasonably direct bearing on R&D content is estimated at 10,000. Appended to this document are scattergrams of counts; a listing of RIE descriptors; and estimations of numbers of documents in RIE, CIJE, and \"Books in Print.\" (Author/DDO)",

Five hundred new teacher units were authorized for each of the interim fiscal years, and new graduate and preservice teacher programs were initiated. Unfortunately, too many teachers remained untrained and uncertified, and in-service training received a low priority compared to preservice. A Reality Oriented Teacher Education Program (ROTE), requiring both faculty and students to work in the field, was instituted. This program placed advanced undergraduate special education majors (prior to student teaching) in classrooms where they had full  responsibility for instruction on a one-day or half-day basis. Their presence released the regularly employed teacher to attend, for credit and with no cost to the school system, field-based course instruction from college and university instructors. Thus, faculty members not only taught in the field but also interacted with school personnel in actual school settings. Courses were based strictly on teacher needs. Student interns coordinated their teaching activities with the regular teacher to ensure maximum continuity and interrelation of instruction for the children. (Author/JA)",

The in-service program offers training to teachers, supervisors, and administrators in the design and implementation of CBE/MUS-focused change via workshops, seminars, courses, and consultant services.

Flexibility is defined, and the purpose and design of NCATE standards discussed. Thurman indicates that deliberate effort has been made in the standards to encourage individuality, imagination, and innovation. In spite of this, he continues, questions about flexibility persist for the following reasons: a) lack of distinction between flexibility and alternative approaches, b) lack of distinction between standards as a basis for program development and evaluation and as a framework for preparing the institutional report,  c) lack of statements in the standards about experimentation, and d) uncertainty about what the visiting team and evaluation board deem important. Each of these reasons is examined in relation to the standards. Thurman advocates working within the standards to improve and develop programs and further explication of the standards by NCATE.

Additional students from the ongoing graduate program participate in MAP as individuals. The success of the program as a model for school/university cooperation in in-service education has led to the development of a comprehensive graduate degree program based on the open education approach.

        "description":"To determine the relationship between selected occupational characteristics and attitudes of New York City middle-school teachers and their potential mobility within the system, a 33-item questionnaire was distributed to all teachers in a random sample of 12 junior high schools and four middle schools. The questionnaire was designed to obtain data for classifying respondents as classroom and career teachers, determine respondents' opinions and the degree to which these opinions influenced their potential mobility, and elicit suggestions for reducing teacher mobility. It was found that the potentially mobile teacher feels that he a) teaches in a school with frequent discipline problems, b) teaches in a school where the staff views the pupils as having little educational potential,  and c) received inadequate support from the school administration. Respondents recommended that in order to reduce mobility a) preservice preparation programs that present a realistic view of the teaching profession should be developed; b) supervisors should guide and assist teachers rather than evaluate them; c) parents and teachers should be included in the policy-making process; and d) parents should be hired as classroom aides. The results of the survey are equivocal because only 17.75% of the random sample responded. It is therefore recommended that caution be exercised in generalizing the results and that the study be replicated using a more adequate sample. (HMD)",

For 3 months, 6 teachers and 206 fifth-grade children participated in a total of 20 field experiences which were implemented at three levels: a) teacher -initiated, in-class activity including sessions with representatives of prospective field sites; b) large-group field trips to observe community sites; and c) actual involvement in the activity of the facility or agency visited. The following participant reactions were noted impressionistically: a) children's interest was carried to and maintained at very high levels; b) teachers responded enthusiastically to the challenge of  developing an out-of-school learning program; and c) parents generally approved of the program although a small but vocal minority strongly disapproved. From this pilot test it was concluded that field experience programs a) will initially require consultant services to assist teachers with planning, b) will require special parent involvement procedures, c) can be supported by the resources which exist in any community, d) are warranted solely on the basis of their realism and relevance, and e) are viable and inexpensive.

School programs are students must begin early. Moreover, for health education to be effective, it must be given a high priority in the school and public health sphere in terms of curriculum time, budget, methodology, community involvement and teacher selection and training. In addition to preservice and in-service teacher programs, which are being intensified to meet the demand, there is a need for each school district to provide leadership in its total health education program. A member of the faculty with approved  preparation should be designated as health coordinator so that the entire faculty may cooperate in realizing the potential values of the school program. The New York Education Department is initiating a training program for health coordinators this summer (1971). Drug education is one of the monumental tasks that lie ahead, and programs will be successful to the extent that individual youths can make intelligent decisions with respect to the health problems confronting them. It is the task of health educators to ensure that this and future generations of young people are enabled to live a life that is creative, humane, and sensitive to the fullest extent. (JA)",

Included in this are statements of task force beliefs, some of which are as follows a) some measurement and evaluation in education is necessary; b) certain measurement and evaluation tools are either invalid, unreliable, out of date, or unfair and should be withdrawn from use (sharply criticized were standardized achievement and intelligence tests as they affect  bilingual/bicultural students; c) the training of those administering tests is inadequate, and schools of education, school systems, and testing industry must take this responsibility; d) there is overkill in the use of standardardized tests; and e) the National Teacher Examinations are an improper tool and must not be used for certification, selection, salary determination, tenure, dismissal, and similar matters. The document includes recommendations for immediate action and further study, &quot;The Report of the Committee on Accountability to the NEA Representative Assembly July 1973&quot; and a bibliography.

The word \"competent\" denotes adequacy, suitability, and sufficiency while \"proficient\" means \"performing with expert correctness or facility.\" This suggests competency-based certification but proficiency-directed teacher education. \"Performance-based teacher education\" refers to observable demonstrations of teaching knowledge and skill while \"competency-based\" refers to minimum standards and criteria. Performance-based teacher education focuses on objectives; competency-based teacher education focuses on  criteria and standards. These terms are not mutually exclusive. Rather, exploration of both modes provides a process through which the central core and the parameters of competency/performance/proficiency-based teacher education can be identified and employed to improve education.

As a language, Competency a) is spoken with varying degrees of fluency and facility, b) is difficult to translate into English because the common vocabulary is used descriptively in English while it is used functionally in Competency, and c) is dynamic in its potential as a precision instrument for communication. Communication in Competency is affected by a) entropy, the freedom of the communicator with regard to word selection; b) redundancy, that part of a message which is unnecessary for understanding; c) noise, or message distortion; and d) channel capacity, or the vocabulary of the listener. Competency is presently used inter- and  intra-personally without consistency of function. Six ordered functions of Competency are a) Binary, used to separate proponents of behavior modification from nonproponents; b) Communicative, used to enhance reliability in describing human behavior phenomena; c) Suggestive, used to encourage major and minor instructional developments; d) Investigative, used to provide a common language for researchers; e) Generative, used to advance thought; and f) Valuative, used to assess competency in personnel. The language of Competency must be developed, refined, and studied carefully by those who use it. (HMD)",

The authors then state that there is a need for a unique management system for PBTE because it is evaluated by primary criteria.  Other special needs requiring a special system involve procedures for designing, installing, maintaining, evaluating, and revising the program. Management functions, components, and their relationship are defined. Also listed and discussed are four principles of PBTE management: successive approximation, selective negligence, structure-induced practice, and accumulative feedback. In addition to 10 pragmatic rules of program adoption or \"heuristic\" for PBTE (including rules such as \"work within the rules of existing management systems whenever possible\"), a detailed model for PBTE management structures and an evaluation model are presented.

Because the concept of PBTE is still being refined, such an analysis must be of a prescriptive and speculative nature. However, several factors which will have an effect on crucial governance issues can be identified: a) universities and state governments have had the most influence on educational policy to date; b) since the current system was institutionalized, teacher organizations, parent groups, ethnic minorities, students, and state legislators have gained in strength and will demand a larger share of the influence on educational policy; c) these varying  interest groups have different value perspectives which the research base of PBTE is unlikely to resolve, with the result that value issues will become intensely political, engendering negotiations, coalitions, and compromises; d) the outcome of these political activities will vary according to the prior political climate of the state and the structure of statewide interest groups; and e) major policy trends such as tenure revision, affirmative action for minority employment, and the declining number of elementary/secondary pupils will effect the implementation of PBTE.

The document stresses the necessity of partnership in teacher education and conceptualizes the Personnel Development Center, defined simply as a place where educational personnel preparation and retraining happen. The remainder of the report focuses on six areas in which educational reform might occur, with a chapter devoted to each. The six areas are a) governance, b)  management and operation, c) financing, d) staffing, e) curriculum, and f) dissemination of promising practices. The chapter on staffing distinguishes between core staff (a partnership of personnel from colleges, schools, and community service agencies) and adjunct staff.

The project was set in the Pilsen, Heart of Chicago, and South Lawndale communities in the center of Chicago. This area contains the central cluster of the second largest urban group of Mexican-Americans in the United States. Many school-aged children speak little or no English. The schools, however, are still staffed mostly by \"Anglo\" personnel who do not speak Spanish and who know very little about the Mexican  culture. By Board of Education edict, the public schools were off-limits to parents until 1968. Even after the schools were \"opened,\" community residents continued to feel unwelcome on school premises and insecure in school affairs. This document recounts the efforts to develop a bilingual, bicultural ubran teacher education program in which the community played an active role. It deals with the origin of the project, operational problems encountered, solutions attempted, and the critical functions of systematic evaluation.

        "description":"This paper presents a historical review of the gradual growth of interest in an establishment of legislation in Massachusetts for institutions concerned exclusively with the training of teachers. Highlighted is the activity of James G. Carter in this endeavor. The state of education at the beginning of the nineteenth century is described: private schools flourished over common schools; and people became teachers because it was easier than manual labor, because they needed employment between more lucrative positions, or because they were not fit for anything else. Carter publicized this situation, advocated a change in the caliber of common school teachers, and called for the establishment of a teacher training institution. Carter's plan for such an institution included a  well-stocked library, professors skilled in their respective areas, a laboratory school, a board of commissioners, and a student teaching program. Carter's private efforts to form such an institution failed in the late 1820s, but while he was a member of the House of Representatives, his bill calling for the establishment of a board of education passed in 1837. The paper concludes with mention of Carter's victory: the establishment of normal schools for the education of teachers in 1838. (JA)",

Twenty-five scales adapted from the MIP were represented by 100 items which the respondents ranked on a one-to-five point Likert scale. Analysis of the responses showed that a) the undergraduate group had significantly lower career needs in the areas of advancement, compensation, recognition, supervision, and work accomplishment; b) the mean differences between the two groups  were not significantly different for 15 of the 25 scales; c) both groups indicated that creativity, cooperation, dedication of teachers, and overall job satisfaction were their most important career needs; and d) both groups agreed that work accomplishment (amount of paper work), structure, recognition, and advancement were low priority career needs. Findings of this study suggest that a) more flexible staffing schedules would increase job satisfaction for teachers; b) schools of education must present a more realistic view of the teaching profession and make stronger efforts to attract males to the profession; and c) studies need to be conducted that relate satisfaction of teachers to their measured effectiveness.

The latter 200 items yielded 25 satisfaction scales and 25 matching need scales. Responses of the study population indicate that career teachers are less than satisfied with their current positions on most of the scales tested. The study findings suggest that schools of education  should a) question whether their programs are having the desired effect in school systems; b) develop conditions that facilitate completion of post graduate studies and encourage commitment to the teaching profession; c) find ways to attract more males to advanced study in curriculum areas; and d) develop instructional programs that encourage creativity in the classroom. Implications for school systems are that evaluation programs should give more priority to teacher satisfaction and a more flexible use of staff would attract talented teachers to part-time service.

It also seemed advantageous to provide a program in an urban and suburban area in order to give veteran teachers in the field more input than they had previously into the training of new teachers, teacher aides, and in-service personnel.

He then describes as a final alternative the use of teacher performance tests, which he first advocated for use in the mid-sixties. The rationale behind this type of test is described as follows: since one of the major difficulties of comparing teachers for evaluation is that different teachers have different instructional emphasis, a teacher's ability to accomplish prespecified instructional objectives should be measured. The teaching performance  test accomplishes this by providing an identical task for different instructors. Projects exploring this method are noted, but further experimentation is advocated. (JA)",

        "description":"This document reviews research and writings of the 1960s that deal with variables operating within the student teacher/cooperating teacher relationship and affecting the outcome of that relationship for the student teacher. Various methods of matching student teacher and cooperating teacher, cognitive dissonance interpretation, and use of Flander's interaction analysis are all reviewed and discussed. One of the conclusions reached indicates that if the power of the cooperating teacher's influence is derived from the student teacher's very real initiation and security needs as described by cognitive dissonance theory, then clearly the more variables upon which a cooperating teacher/student teacher pair can be matched, the better. However, a concern evident in this literature  search must still be considered, that is, whether effective matching is really possible. The indication is that matching may be in itself less important to final student reaching outcomes and gains than efforts to focus the attention of both the cooperating teacher and student teacher on criteria existing outside of their interaction; for this feedback, systems such as interaction analysis offer the best promise.

That selection entails a review of the principal points and findings within the domain and of the implications of the findings for the development of training materials for teacher education. The first section of the paper delineates the characteristics of skilled performance and briefly examines the stages that the learners pass through as they acquire such skills. Three variables are identified--instructions, practice, and knowledge of results--that have been widely investigated and that are applicable to training materials. Summarized are some of the  principal generalizations about these variables, especially as they seem to pertain to the ultimate objective of designing training materials. The second section of the paper deals with an analysis of skilled performance in teaching and extrapolates from the research on complex skills learning how one might design training materials in the area of the teaching of concepts.

CBTE is defined as follows: its objective is to specify competencies; it applies systems theory; and it features personalization and individualization, instructional modes and management and evaluation procedures. These components are then viewed from the perspective of ECE and are found to be well in keeping with its ideas (e.g., the stating of goals and objectives in ECE dates back to such pioneers as Froebel and Montessori). It is stated that incorporating the assumptions of ECE and CBTE will result in many major changes in early childhood teacher preparation programs. One of these proposed changes  is that students will work with young children throughout the entire program rather than for a few weeks during the student teaching experience. Personnel role changes also, it is stated, will be great to suit the needs of CBTE. The document then reviews some ECE programs that have CBTE implications and cites the Ohio (Toledo) Model (1968) as having been a previous, serious, all-inclusive attempt to wrestle with the problem of educational change.

Only 19 states presently award certificates through CAC. This can be explained partially by the fact that state educational agencies can attain the goal of CAC only when the teacher preparation institutions make the complex transition to performance-based teacher education programs. Nine states have decided against CAC, five are undecided, and the remaining 35 states (70%) intend to implement CAC at some future date. Thirty-seven state educational agencies consider the assessment of teacher competencies to be the responsibility of teacher preparation institutions. Seven states report that  there is some plan for the renewal of term certification or the issuance of permanent certification on the basis of assessing the teacher's competencies while he is employed.

Literature treating the failure of universities in educating teachers is reviewed. It is stated that many educators desire total movement of teacher education to a school center that is off the college campus and that is run by the public schools for the objectives of public education. The authors state that one of the motives for such a movement would be to seek a climate more conducive to change than the one that currently exists in teacher education. This paper stresses the need for schools of education to establish programs that are of the college but not in the college; programs that are in the  public schools but that have combined staffs. The education of high school teachers is given as an example. For this new major, whether it is called \"secondary education\" or \"secondary teaching\", the location is a clinical setting in the public schools; the approach is performance- and product-based.

The Kansas State Department of Education developed two questionnaires, one consisting of 16 performance-related items for rating elementary school teachers and the other consisting of 12 items for rating secondary school teachers. Using a four-point scale, principals, supervisors, or district heads completed questionnaires for 39 secondary school teachers and 21 elementary school teachers. The responses indicate that a) secondary school teachers attained a mean score of 35.87 out of a possible 48; b) elementary school teachers attained a mean of 44.14 out of a  possible 64; c) 92.1% of secondary school teachers were recommended for employment; and d) 95.3% of elementary school teachers were recommended for employment. It appears then that the products of Fort Hays State College's teacher education program are well prepared in relation to their peers. However, the smallness of the sample limits the study, and findings should be considered tentative until they are validated. Further research suggestions include a) a replication of this study with a sample from the three state colleges in Kansas and b) a combined teacher-employer study in which evaluations of teachers are compared with those of their employers.

Student engagement, teacher strategy use, and the relationship between them were analyzed. The major findings were that a) there were large differences in level and mode (receptive or expressive) of engagement among classrooms and among observation rounds; b) the frequency of strategy use varied among teachers and for individual teachers from one  observation round to another; c) the mean percentage of students engaged rose significantly during the year; d) there were no significant differences in level or type of engagement by sex or ethnicity of students, or by subject matter; e) level of engagement differed significantly by size of instructional group, with lower levels for large groups than for small or dyadic groups; and f) level of engagement in the classroom was not clearly related to the use of particular strategies. The findings point to the importance of molar instructional and environmental settings as factors in engagement. They suggest a modification of the conceptual orientation of the study. (Author)",

The rapid growth of PBTE is creating unrealistic expectations for educational reform which may prematurely destroy its potential. Although PBTE is promoted as a radically different form of teacher education, it is not significantly different from previous methods. PBTE's problems are a combination of (a) lack of knowledge of the relationship of teacher behaviors to pupil outcomes and (b) problems inherent in instruction and evaluation, design and management by consortia, humanist reaction, certification procedures, premature legislation, organized  opposition, and development and operating costs. It is recommended that USOE take immediate steps to moderate claims of widespread educational reform through PBTE and discourage premature legislation for competency-assessed certification. Long-term recommendations are that USOE (a) fund a comprehensive analysis of PBTE, (b) establish a policy group to advise Federal teacher education planners, (c) promote research on teacher effectiveness and social factors affecting child learning, (d) compare the cost effectiveness of PBTE with alternate models, (e) inform the public of the complexities of educational policy making, and (f) clarify national goals as they relate to future teacher training needs.

Responses to a 1972 Gallup Public Opinion poll are given as well as responses given by university professors to a governance opinionnaire. Chapter III emphasizes that each group desiring participation in the aspects of governing should be gauged in terms of the contributions' direct applicability to the program and that teachers should be prepared by a systematic program. This chapter also  contains a discussion of seven components of a teacher education model and concludes with examples of governance models in teacher education programs. Chapter V stresses that implementation of governance models should be preceded by thorough planning and facilitated by adequate project management. The procedure for planning developed by Koontz & O'Donnell is listed and a planning model is examined which suggests that planning be divided into early and advanced phases. The project management section discusses criteria for identifying an undertaking as a project, general steps for planning and controlling a project, and guidelines for maintaining satisfactory project management.

Its primary purpose was to investigate the effect of an undergraduate exploratory field experience (pre-student teaching) course on the attitudes held by prospective teachers. The study focused in part on the relationship between attitude change of the pre-student teachers and the following eight demographic and descriptive variables: sex, elementary vs. secondary levels, major curricular areas, university classification, ACT composite scores, grade point averages, grades received in the introduction to teaching course, and grade levels of the pre-student teaching experience. The samples of the study included 162  elementary and 286 secondary pre-student teachers for a total of 448 students enrolled in the Exploratory Field Experience Course. The attitudes were reflected in responses to statements in the Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory (MTAI) administered at the beginning and end of both semesters of the course. Results indicated that students entered the program with a positive attitude towards interpersonal relationships with children and teaching as a career and left the program with an even stronger positive attitude in these areas.

        "description":"The purpose of this program to train developers in public education systems was to construct and test a viable model that would fulfill its training goals in one year and which could also be replicated under similar conditions by comparable institutions. The model involved a part-time program which provided theoretical and experiential training for 15 public school educators in the role of educational developer, a role which required interpretation of ideas from educational research and implementation of these ideas in education programs. Ten of the 15 participants were members of minority groups and nine were women. The program had three major phases: an intensive 6-week workshop in methods of educational research and evaluation; a semester of classroom instruction in  educational administrative leadership and the sociology of complex organizations; and a field experience in which the participants designed and implemented an innovative educational development project. Although the general feasibility of the model was validated, process and summative evaluation information suggested some desirable modifications in the model. The model could be improved by using more rigorous criteria for the selection of participants, limiting the scope of the field projects to more manageable projects, focusing more on the theory and practice of urban education, and emphasizing only those research techniques necessary for implementation of the developmental projects.

The program was designed to increase student achievement by increasing teacher recognition and reinforcement of student behavior. In a 5-day workshop held before the start of the school year, the researchers presented concepts of motivation; effective, nonpunitive techniques for controlling undesirable student behavior; the theory of positive reinforcement; means of preventing experiences of failure; and group and individual problem-solving skills. During the school year, the program included weekly and biweekly miniworkshops and a support system providing materials and technical assistance to participant teachers. Improving communication,  gathering and transmitting information, and problem solving were the foci of the miniworkshops. Both the researchers and the participants evaluated the program at the end of the school year. Although many desirable behavior changes were observed, the goals of improving the student achievement and changing teacher and pupil attitudes and behaviors were not met. Factors that reduced the effectiveness of the program included the expectation of failure on the part of the principal and some teachers, low personal and professional self-concepts among many teachers, and a pervasive sense of pressure and futility.

The catalog was compiled by the staff of the Stanford Center for Research and Development in Teaching (SCRDT) Program on Teaching Effectiveness as part of an effort to develop a systematic teacher training model. A 117-item product description form developed by the staff was used to analyze and describe each of the 657 products entered in the catalog. This report presents the frequency and distribution of product characteristics according to the following major categories: developers, subject matter specificity, target outcomes for teachers, target outcomes for students, product availability, the nature of the training situation (including whether materials must be supplied  by the user), and the availability of field test results. The extent of agreement among the analysts in describing products was tested on a sample of six products. The range of values was 3 (maximum disagreement) to 6 (maximum agreement). The overall mean agreement on the 117 descriptors was 5.7. For 45% of the products, the developers responded to a request for verification of the description of their products. The compilation and tabulations show what areas of teaching and what teaching skills product developers had addressed as of the fall of 1973. The means of making the catalog available outside SCRDT are under consideration. The catalog is not included in this report. (Authors)",

Pre- and post-video tapes of their teaching performances were scored and compared using analysis of covariance. It was found that, compared to the control group, experimental-group teachers repeated pupil answers less often, answered their own questions less often, and used more higher-cognitive questions in discussions. In tutoring sessions, they used more diagnostic questions, verbal praise, demonstration techniques, and evaluation. The overall significance of this experiment is that it serves as a demonstration that  microteaching as a specialized technique, and Minicourses as an adaptation of it, can be used effectively, within certain limits, in training preservice teachers.

Six speakers at the symposium explained their reasoning behind these propositions  and illustrated their remarks with descriptions of CIRCUS, a program of new instruments and supporting services for preschool and kindergarten teachers. Titles of the six presentations are: Assessment for Personal and Educational Development; Language Comprehension and Performance; Memory and Experience; Quantitative and Relational Understanding; Problem Solving and Divergent Production; and, The Context of Assessment and the Assessment of Context.

Selected research literature concerning factors influencing the evaluation of young children is reviewed. Some new data is presented, including a syntactic analysis of verbal directions for children's tests and an analysis of the difficulty of directions read by children on other instruments. The normative equivalents of change-level scores on a number of standardized measures of  cognitive variables are examined. The evidence supports the original conceptualization of cultural bias.

It was hypothesized that (1) girls would decline in greater numbers and to a greater degree than boys; and (2) areas and amounts of sex differences of the decliners would differ from those of the total sample. Both of these hypotheses were substantiated under a design that examined the subject's student records to determine the type and the score of the IQ test each had taken in early adolescence. The subjects were then given another IQ test, the FIRO-B test of inter-personal relations, a semantic differential and a questionnaire on sex roles. The results showed that overall girls lost IQ points while boys  gained. Decliners of both sexes lost an average of ten points, and also had fewer differences in their responses to the other measures than the boys and girls in the total sample. (Author/NE)",

The use of a single test for decision making has been proven inadequate, and in fact the test publishers caution against this practice. The use of test results with minority groups has been questioned insistently, and lacks valid evidence for fair use. Although the courts have been hearing litigation cases involving university policies for only ten years, there is an increasing tendency to examine academic decision with the prospects of accelerated review. This seems to be the results of several forces which involve the present trend to re-evaluate the role of higher education, civil rights  protection, and student rights. This trend may reverse the prevailing majority position of universities in the record of court decisions. Individuals applying to professional programs should be able to submit any evidence which seems appropriate to them for consideration by the university, which in turn should require its own evidence. An analysis of all data should be made and included in a report for the faculty directly concerned. Several other procedures for the student's benefit should be undertaken. It has been estimated that such procedures could be implemented efficiently and at reasonable cost. (NE)",

        "description":"An examination of mean scores for two samples of 884 and 1570 high school students who were administered the National Merit Scholarship Qualification Test (NMSQT) in 1962 and for the entire population of 794,589 students given the same test in 1965 revealed consistent effects of birth order on mean score. Earlyborn, and firstborn in particular, scored higher within constant family sizes. Covariance of mother education, father education, family income, and mother age failed to alter the relationship. A step-down analysis of the five NMSQT tests (English Usage, Math Usage, Social Studies Reading, Natural Sciences Reading, and Word Usage) suggested that a verbal component represents the primary source of the birth order effect. Sibling spacing and sex were also considered. Closely  following siblings, whether male or female, tended to score lower. The number of like-sexed siblings in a family, however, appeared not to affect any of the test scores appreciably. Comparison of the results of this study with the results of studies of twins and studies of family size effects leads to the possibility that the causes of higher scores for earlyborn and well-spaced siblings but lower scores for laterborn, twins, and closely-spaced siblings may all relate to the degree of isolation from other siblings during the early months of life.

In response to this problem, the Children's Behavioral Classification Project has been extended into the preschool years and the Preschool Behavioral Classification Project form (PBCP) has been developed. When completed, the PBCP contained 268 behavioral items and five demographic variables (age, sex, race, socio-economic level, and clinic-nonclinic status). The PBCP was then administered to the 1350 parents. Twenty-two major factors were produced in the statistical analysis. Examples of factors produced include: sexual curiosity; disobedience; direct aggesssion;  verbal hyperactivity; separation anxiety; positive social orientation; perserverance; and sociability. Presently, the test-retest reliability of the instrument is being determined. With respect to future research norms will be established for each factor for each age. Other studies which will be carried out include validity studies, reliability studies, and longitudinal studies. Eventually the focus of the research will concentrate on the use of the PBCP in evaluating the efficiency of therapeutic programs. (MLP)",

The method selected should meet Cronbach's criterion that it would consider individual differences as well as group performance. Tucker's (1960, 1966) method seemed to be able to identify differing abilities while at the same time preserve individual differences. Using Kaiser's Little Jiffy Mark IV to skirt the problem of difficulty factors, a factor of two film tests found two factors operating in each test. Had the task been longer (some authors recommended 1000 items) more factors might have been found; it is equally likely, however, that diminishing returns would soon obtain. It was demonstrated that Tucker's  method revealed abilities that a conventional learning curve would mask, and learning curves of several different individuals were illustrated. Some attempt was made to describe the obtained factors with other variables; at least one factor correlated with a variable similar to Gestalt completion or serial integration. Finally the effect of three stimulus characteristics upon item preference was considered. Test part (number of stimulus frames, or number of delay frames) rarely accounted for an important part of item preference, whereas position in the array always did and color did in the two color tests.

This paper justifies and illustrates a simple, direct application of Bayes' Formula to expectancy tables. To make the application a counselor must specify prior probabilities that a student will attain success (defined appropriately). He may then take the probabilities within the expectancy table as likelihoods, apply Bayes' formula and obtain a posterior distribution of success for that student. This procedure allows a counselor the advantage of bringing to bear his personal knowledge of those students with whom he works. It will enable him to consider such diverse things as whether a student is an over-achiever, has just recovered from an  extended illness or even the fact that there was a death in the student's family recently. Hopefully, the method will allow counselors to better aid their clients. A complete example demonstrating the application is included. (Author)",

The Horst (1965), Bartlett (1937), and Anderson and Rubin (1956) methods gave what was judged as satisfactory estimates for the (artificial) populations of data. The cross-validational procedures showed the Horn (1965) method to yield highly unstable estimates. It was concluded that the method of using columns of the factor loading matrix as weights to be used in estimating factor measurements cannot be recommended for general applications since this procedure  consistently provided highly unstable estimates.

The Ss were then given one of three tasks which required them to identify target items from among distractor items (also CVCVC verbal units). The tasks were the Embedded Item, Multiple Choice, and Shepard-Teghtsoonian. Results demonstrated that the Multiple Choice task yielded the greatest number of correct recognitions, lowest number of false recognitions, and lowest number of nonrecognitions when compared with the other two recognition tasks. Although scores on each of the three tasks correlated with meaningfulness (M), associative  reaction time (RT), and pronunciability ratings (PR) of the target items, the magnitude of the coefficients for M and RT were almost identical (rs ranged from .41 to .67) but greater than the coefficients between PR and recognition scores (rs ranged from .36 to .59).

It is concluded that scoring items in four or more categories, as opposed to the usual dichotomous scoring, can increase information gain by a factor of two or more in the lower range of ability. Thus, the error of measurement is decreased to an extent equivalent to doubling the test length in this range. Alternatively, one can sample the range of ability in the target population with far rewer items.

Results of the first two years of the Study of Mathematically and Scientifically Precocious Youth (SMSPY) are examined to show that considerable educational acceleration is not only feasible but also desirable for those young people who are eager to move ahead. Skipping school grades, taking college courses part-time, studying in special courses, and entering college early are proposed. These are simple to carry out. inexpensive, and supplemental to regular school practices. The SMSPY staff does not advocate the usual in-grade, non-accelerative &quot;enrichment&quot; procedures often  recommended for intellectually gifted children. The approach in this paper is via cases and references to numerous SMSPY studies. It is meant to be an heuristic overview of the main assumptions and findings. (Author)",

        "description":"The Intermediate Form of the Educational Quality Assessment Inventory (EQUI) for grades 7 and 9 is designed to provide Commonwealth schools with reliable information about student development in each of the 10 education goals. The EQAI measures the students' attitudes, values, beliefs, habits and basic cognitive skills. This manual, organized in four sections, gives insight into the technical properties of the EQAI scales. The first section highlights the procedures and techniques used to construct and field-test the assessment instruments and gives an overview of the total inventory. Section two discusses the 10 quality education goals and the measurement devices associated with each. Included in this section are the goal and measurement rationales, scale and subscale  descriptions, scoring procedures, reliability and validity findings for each instrument. Section three offers a series of tables which isolate specific student target groups that might benefit the most from programs designed to facilitate growth in each goal area. Section four discusses additional properties of the battery and summarizes the interrelationship between all scales and subscales. For related articles see TM 003 395 and TM 003 396. (Author/MLP)",

Measures of the battery displayed their best validities with such longer-term criterion dimensions as Social and Vocational Adjustment, Job Success and Satisfaction and Job Search Motivation. The most valid tests were three Practical Reasoning measures (i.e., skill at following directions in job tasks); three Vocational Orientation measures (i.e., knowledge of job requirements and skill at seeking and holding jobs) and two attitudinal measures (Self-Esteem and Attitude Toward Authority). The most relevant short-term  criteria were also identified and future potential of the test battery for programmatic evaluation and guidance applications was discussed. (Author)",

        "description":"Those of us who are committed to the pedagogical enterprise are called upon to re-examine, clarify, and perhaps justify the presuppositions, methods, and goals that provide the framework within which education and development are carried on. Recent publications by several writers have reintroduced notions that demand critical examination, particularly with reference to the processes of education, schooling, and upward mobility of people of low status in our society. These works have been the basis of recent attempts to use educational and behavioral science data to support the assertion that schooling can make little difference in the efforts of low-status people to achieve equality or a fair chance at survival. Two primary lines or argument have been advanced: (1) it is asserted  that some ethnic groups or races are genetically inferior to others and thus are incapable of benefiting from schooling to the same extent as are the others. Among the scholars whose work has been used to support this position are Eysenk, Herrnstein, Jensen, and Shockley; and (2) it is asserted that schools make little difference and are not effective forces in changing the life chances of the pupils who pass through them. Among the scholars whose works have been used to support this position are Coleman and Jencks. What is more important than how these scholars feel and what may be their motives is what the media try to tell us about the meaning of this work and what the society decides to do about the problems at which their work is directed.

The study was conducted within three Title I schools in a large sourthern metropolitan school system and the method, believed appropriate for culturally different first graders, is generalizeable to other populations. The research was based upon a sample of 70 children, including 40 subjects who produced positive screening results. The screening battery composed of the Metropolitan Readiness Test, the Slosson Drawing Coordination Test, and the Wepman Auditory Discrimination Test was administered by teachers and school  counselors. Test results were interpreted in terms of cut-off points and a hypothetical &quot;diagnostic&quot; profile. After eliminating metnally retardate suspects, 40 &quot;diagnostic&quot; subjects were identified. All subjects screening positive, together with a comparison group of 30 subjects drawn randomly from the original population, were further evaluated with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children and Frostig. In addition, the classroom teachers rated each subject on a rating scale specially designed to reflect classroom performance factors believed to be characteristics of learning disabilities. Alpha and beta error analysis between the three sources of data showed total errors ranging between 14 and 18 percent. Analysis of variance indicated significant differences between 18 of the 28  major variables in the study. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The thesis that intelligence is based on heredity was dramatically revived in 1969 by an article in the \"Harvard Educational Review\" by Arthur Jensen, a psychologist at the University of California at Berkeley. The article, which received wide attention, was sharply criticized by those who hold that it is environment rather than genes which puts populations at a disadvantage. The materials assembled for this bibliography have been selected (from numerous published materials on the subject) to represent as many points of view and scientific disciplines as have made themselves known since Jensen's article. To preserve the sequence of the debate, we have maintained in each section a chronological order. Two predecessors of Jensen, Young and Dobzhansky, are included as examples of  earlier theorists who deal with some aspects of genetics. In attempting to arrange and classify the points of view, we have found many works which elude hard and fast categorization. This accounts for some seemingly arbitrary decisions of ours, and for the fact that the largest section includes those writers who consider intelligence to be a complex amalgam of both heredity and environment--the \"synthesizers.\" One thing is clear--no one discipline (psychology, sociology, or even genetics) can be linked to a strict hereditarian or a strict environmentalist approach. This will be apparent from the identification of the author (as he was when he wrote) which follows each entry. The index lists authors and publications. (Author/JM)",

The major purposes of the Research and Evaluation Department of the Dallas Independent School District are to provide useful information to decision-makers and to serve as an accountability agent. The process requires cooperative action by decision-makers (i.e., curriculum developers, teachers, and administrators) and evaluators. The evaluator has four broad obligations in the evaluation process: to focus on evaluative information to be provided; to collect, organize, and analyze this information; to administer evaluative activities; and to provide relevant evaluative feedback to decision-makers at all levels. To provide  these evaluation processes, the District's Department of Research and Evaluation is organized into three branches. The first, System-Wide Testing, is responsible for the design and implementation of the District's system-wide norm-referenced and criterion-referenced testing programs. The second, System-Wide Evaluation, performs the longitudinal and cross-sectional research and evaluation necessary to supply major District decision-makers with information about the overall functioning of the District's programs. The third, Developmental Project Evaluation, evaluates specific developmental projects to ascertain the effectsof those projects on developing specific student abilities in areas that generally need additional mediation to that which is provided by the District's general academic  program.

Project Conquest has two complementary components, remedial reading instruction and inservice remedial reading training, for teachers. There are 19 centers throughout the target areas. Remedial instruction is provided in 45 minute sessions held four and one half days per week. Reading rooms and clinics are similar in that they provide: (1) extensive diagnosis of each child's reading-related problems, (2) techniques and materials  tailored to meet each child's diagnosed needs, (3) remediation either individually, or most often, in groups of six children and one clinician, (4) an experience carefully structured so that the student rearely fails to attain his objectives, and (5) a warm, one-to-one relationship with the children, using an abundance of praise and encouragement to enhance self-esteem. Children are selected on the basis of their failure to read up to their potential or at grade level and they are released when they reach one of these established goals.

        "description":"As part of the development of a battery of tests to determine proficiency in black standard and nonstandard speech, the authors developed a two-part test consisting of 20 items designed to evoke a response by means of verbal and pictorial cues. Each cue was supposed to elicit a specific grammatical construction characteristic of either black nonstandard English or black standard English. The tests were recorded on tape and administered by six black experimenters to 27 third graders (22 black, 5 non-black; 14 male, 13 female) and 32 sixth graders (26 black, six non-black; 17 male, 15 female). Two treatments (implicit vs. explicit) were used. In the implicit treatment the expectation of a response in standard or nonstandard speech was conveyed only by the verbal cue used for each  item. In the explicit treatment the difference between standard and nonstandard speech and the expectation regarding the answer were explained to the subject before each part of the test. Both parts of the test were scored according to whether the subject used the grammatical construction that the item was supposed to elicit or whether the subject's response as a whole was appropriate to the language of the stimulus. In addition, balance scores, scored positively for imbalance in favor of nonstandard speech, were established by subtracting scores on the standard test from those on the nonstandard. Only the scores achieved by the Black subjects were included in the main analysis of the test results. In general the scores were heavily weighted in facor of standard over  non-non-standard--i.e., the students produced more appropriate responses to standard cues than to nonstandard cues.

The primary objectives of the Corrective Reading Program were: (1) to provide corrective reading diagnosis and remediation services for each participant so that he can expand his vocabulary and comprehension of reading material; and (2) to provide individualized corrective reading instruction so that program participants will increase in specific reading skill areas based on initial diagnosis of reading difficulties. The evaluation of the Corrective Reading Program supports the conclusion  that the program achieved the objectives set for it. The primary objective of the English as a Second Language Program was to increase the oral language proficiency of non-English speaking and English as a Second Language pupils in the target population. Among the findings were the following: (1) most of the classes were organized on a grade level rather than on an English proficiency basis. The consequent wide-range of student abilities caused considerable frustration for both teacher and students; (2) teachers varied greatly in their judgment of what was acceptable English; some used accent as a criterion, others were concerned with grammar, still others disregarded those criteria in favor of basic communication of meaning; and, (3) the use of the project Evaluation Test to place and  promote ESL students has added a needed formal aspect to the program screening procedures.

The program's objectives were: (1) to raise substantially the reading levels of those needy open enrollment pupils, and (2) to change positively their attitudes toward and use of books and related reading materials. The Reading Skills Center focused primarily on open enrollment fourth, fifth, and sixth grade children in need of remedial reading. The major goal of the program was to significantly raise the reading skills of these open enrollment children as well as  their in-district classmates. A second, ancillary goal was related to altering the classroom approaches of teachers to reading. The Junior High Reading Laboratory Program focused largely on open enrollment children in junior high grades who were two years behind in their reading levels. The major objectives of the program were to substantially raise the reading levels of these children and to effect positive change in their self-images and their attitudes toward reading, books, and school. The purpose behind the Environmental Center Program was to develop in low-achieving, fifth grade children a greater understanding and appreciation of the interdependency of plants, animals, and their natural habitats. The Program placed special emphasis upon the problems of ecology, pollution, and man's  effect on his surroundings. (Author/JM)",

The center is staffed by a reading specialist, a part-time psychologist and two educational assistants. Morning sessions are held for children throughout the district who are bussed to the center and afternoon sessions for children in the neighboring school. Children attend the center for a period of a semester. Upon the recognition by the Advisory Council of the need for in-service training for new and inexperienced teachers, the Teaching Training for New and Inexperienced Teachers Program came into  being. As it is constituted, three teacher trainers have been assigned to two or three schools each, depending upon the need. Three teacher trainers have been assigned to two or three schools each, depending upon the need. An appraisal of junior high school reading achievement indicated that many of these students were reading far below grade level. It was decided to institute a special reading program for them. The program selected consists basically of controlled readers supplemented by workbooks. The J. H. S. Reading Laboratories program was instituted in February, 1971. The Educational Assistants to Aid Underachievers program was instituted in 10 elementary schools with a staff of 20 educational assistants assigned to them, according to need. The assistants are used for early  identification and remediation of first graders with reading problems. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The Corrective Mathematics Services Program for Disadvantaged Pupils in Nonpublic Regular Day Schools, funded under Title I of the 1965 Elementary Secondary Education Act, was proposed to serve approximately 14,032 poverty area children who attended 165 non-public regular day schools. Those children were eligible for these services whose score on a standardized test in mathematics was more than one standard deviation below the grade norm. Corrective services were provided by licensed teachers from the New York City Board of Education as an in-school program during the regular school hours. In addition, a room was made available by the non-public school. Teachers were to be given in-service training and instructional material and necessary equipment were to be provided. Most  children were to receive instruction in groups of approximately ten pupils. Two stated objectives of the program were as follows: (1) Pupils in grades two and three in the project will be expected to increase achievement levels in computational skills from six months to one year depending upon age, grade, degree of retardation and other causative factors. They will also be expected to increase achievement levels in verbal problem solving from three to eight months ceteris paribus. Moreover, these children will be expected to demonstrate increased interest and curiosity in mathematics. (2) Pupils in grades four, five and six enrolled in the project will be expected to develop greater skill in translating verbal problems into mathematical equations and in finding solutions.

        "description":"The Head Start Program, established in the summer of 1971 in District 15 in Brooklyn, is a pre-school program for children of economically disadvantaged families. Its two main goals are: (1) to prepare children with no prior school experience for entry into kindergarten and first grade and (2) to involve parents in the education of their children by offering them needed educational and social services under the auspices of the schools in which their children are enrolled. The main emphasis of the Early Elementary Program, Grades One and Two, was directed toward the remediation of deficiencies in reading skills demonstrated by the children during the regular school year. 16 schools belonging to District 15 participated during the summer of 1972. The Later Elementary Program  involved grades three through five in 16 of District 15's schools. The 1972 summer program varied according to the schools and individuals involved but the emphases on reading and mathematics were constant. Principals described the program as including activities titled &quot;enrichment.&quot; These included dramatics, art, music, dance, trips, and ethnic cultural experiences. Most programs included a bilingual class for Spanish speaking children. A summer Junior High Program operated from July fifth through August eleventh at five schools for a total of 30 sessions. Approximately 2,000 children from the secondary schools of District 15 and from the non-public schools in the Title I area of District 15 were accepted for enrollment. In four of the five schools, the four hour school day was divided  to permit three course offerings, whereas one school used modular scheduling. (Author/JM)",

In most instances the target population has been identified by feeder school counselors as a group that could benefit from smaller classes and the possibility of individual attention. At five designated high schools--one to each borough--C.D.D.P. students were separated from the rest of the high school population to receive concentrated work in major subjects (math, foreign languages, science, social studies and English), with a special emphasis placed on basic skills. They were part of the mainstream of each school  for minor subjects, electives, and in some instances for other subjects. Presumably this program was also supposed to provide tutorial service before and after regular school hours, as well as supplementary cultural activities and an exposure to college campuses. The program presently has a total student population of about 1400, with a staff consisting of teachers, coordinators, guidance counselors, student aides, family assistance, and one secretary. The stated goals are the following: (1) improving student achievement in academic subjects; (2) improving reading and math performance on standardized examinations; (3) developing an awareness of culture and the arts; and, (4) improving the changes for college admission and retention.

During the academic year 1972-73 the program was conducted at 32 high schools in New York City and enrolled approximately 11.000 students. The major components of the program were intensive guidance services, small class size, tutoring, family assistant services, double reading and math periods, and cultural events. In addition, the Program sponsored conferences where students could meet professional people from a variety of fields. This evaluation undertook to investigate the implementation and effectiveness of  the formal objectives outlined in the program proposal. Data on student achievement on standardized tests of reading and mathematics, attendance, grade point averages, as well as admission to college and receipt of financial aid on the part of senior students, were collected. Additionally, student attitudes and motivations were assessed through self-report questionnaires and staff perceptions of the CB program were measured via mailed-in questionnaires and extensive structured interviews of teachers, guidance counselors, and coordinators. While data analysis focussed on determining whether the program met its formal objectives, supplementary analyses were performed which provide richer detail on the success of the various program components.

The essential components of the program are as follows: (1) identification and diagnosis of pre-school children with major general and specific learning disabilities; (2) provisions of a pre-school classroom environment for appropriate diagnosed and classified children; (3) assistance of parents to understand the problems of their children and to develop and use  appropriate child-training procedures; and, (4) arrangements for the admission of these children as they reach the age of five years in public and private educational facilities; and, follow-up on the adjustment of children and their parents when they are no longer affiliated with the program. Sixteen classroom units were in operation during the 1972-73 school year, primarily domiciled in public and private hospitals in the five boroughs of New York City. Over 400 children were screened for admission by hospital-based teams consisting of medical, speech, psychological, and educational professionals. A total of 299 children who met all admission criteria were in attendance in the pre-school classroom programs established in the 16 units. The evaluation objectives were based upon the  predictions of behavioral changes presented in specific program objectives. (Author/JM)",

Most of the students are from Spanish-speaking or French-speaking backgrounds, althought the project serves as many as 20 different language groups. To overcome the language problem of these students in the 50 high schools selected for participation, three (later increased to four) teacher trainers were employed at the Central Board, a variety of curriculum materials was uniformly introduced to the schools, and a structure was provided to coordinate and direct the  overall effort. Specifically, the program objectives which were evaluated were: (1) the efficacy of the teacher-training program; (2) the number of classroom visitations, workshops and demonstration lessons offered by the Central Board staff of teacher-trainer consultants; (3) the degree to which the project has made teacher participants more aware of the special needs of non-English speaking learners; (4) the amount of articulation among high schools in the project reported by ESL department chairmen; (5) a comparison of the dropout rate of ESL students in the program with comparable grade level and aged children in conventional classes; and, (6) student growth on the Puerto Rican Scale &quot;A&quot;, a rating scale used by classroom teachers to evaluate the children's ability to speak and  understand spoken English. The Linguistic Capacity Index was also used to assess pupil achievement in learning English as a second language. (Author/JM)",

At each of six high schools, the guidance counselors together with the counselors of each school's feeder schools, selected a group of 250 incoming students whose records indicated severe learning disabilities that would make them higher potential dropouts. In general, these students who appeared economically as well as educationally disadvantaged, had to travel by bus to reach their schools which were situated in middle class economic settings. Among the additional services and modifications provided for these students were smaller classes, specially modified schedules, lighter  course loads, special remedial instruction, intensive guidance and school-home liaison, and referrals to a school psychologist when needed. All six high schools were part of a simple project with an overall concern for supporting, guiding and enriching the school experience of an atypical group of students. Nevertheless, each school exercised a great deal of autonomy and operated a program unique to that school. In part these differences in program may have been directed by differences in the incoming student population. In part the differences in program may have been dicated by the balance or unbalance of strengths, values, and predilections among the project personnel involved. (Author/JM)",

The various  Title I components varied from special programs set in one school to other programs which were in all grade schools. The diversity and comprehensiveness of programs required close monitoring by the District Office. At the school level funded programs were often those directly implemented by principal or an assistant principal. Some programs had a coordinator whose function was to see that the program was being implemented at the various settings. At the district level funded programs were monitored by the two deputy superintendents and the Title I coordinator.

The objectives of the Return to School program were to place students, who exhibited anti-social behavior or who were frequently truant, into special instructional units where their educational and social needs would be met. A specific objective was to prepare these youth for a return to their regular classrooms. This program was based in school and non-school facilities. The Guidance Aides program was based in seven elementary schools, one intermediate school, and three junior high schools--all in District 15, Brooklyn. Paraprofessionals--young adults well known in the school communities which they served--were assigned to  work as assistants to the guidance counselors in their work with educationally and economically disadvantaged children and their parents. The third project is composed of two seperate programs funded under State Urban Education. The Diagnostic Reading Program's major objectives were (1) to show significant positive changes in reading achievement and basic reading skills for those children who are retarded in reading ability and (2) to provide teacher training through demonstration lessons for the classroom teacher. The program consisted of three components: small group teaching, demonstration and/or team teaching, and individual tutoring. The major objective of the Multi-Media Program was to improve the reading skills of retarded readers by supplementing their regular classroom reading  program with laboratory experiences.

These funds were used to establish two programs. The major objectives of the Corrective Reading program were: (1) to provide corrective reading diagnostic and prescriptive services for each participant so that he will increase his competence in reading; and (2) to increase individualization of instruction for program participants through the services of paraprofessionals as a means of increasing pupil growth in reading. The data presented in this report support the conclusion that the program was successful in achieving its objective. The major objective of the English As A Second Language (ESL)  program was to increase the ability of non-native speaking pupils to understand and speak English. A corollary objective of the program was to move ESL students toward the acquisition of reading and writing skills in English as readiness is attained. Among the findings revealed by the evaluation of the program operation were the following: (1) major changes in the planned program design were made at each school; these changes did result in more students being serviced by the program than originally planned, but the changes also resulted in a concomitant reduction in the average amount of instruction in English received by students in the program and (2) there was high mobility in the non-English speaking student population.

A dilemma is usually throught of as any situation necessitating a choice between equally unfavorable alternatives. But it doesn't have to be. Why can't we have good schools in both places, suburbs and cities? If the life style of parents draws them to the suburbs or to the cities, they should be able to know that the quality of schooling will be high and that it will be consistent in quality. This standard has been challenged in recent  years. One of the main reasons people leave cities has nothing to do with schools; it's the shortage of decent housing. But there are important Federal aids to housing available through Housing and Urban Development. In addition, fair housing assistance is being strengthened. In the aggregate, efforts to assist minority business development will have expended 265 percent between 1970 and 1975. The primary value of these programs has been to increase the earnings of the minority banks and thereby enhance their ability to attract capital. The courts cannot do it all. The ultimate responsibility is where it always has been--with us and our teachers, with our school boards, with community leaders, and with the children's parents. Plenty of Federal and State assistance is avialable to make the  transition to a desegregated school system a little easier. (Author/JM)",

Internally, NCTTC provides all services to trainees other than the ABE component. Specifically, it provides a recruitment function, guidance function, placement service, shop training program, and supervision of on-the-job training by site-liaison personnel. The ABE program is a major attempt to serve individuals with both a program oriented toward the acquisition of occupational competency, as well as a basic education which serves two purposes: (1) that of personal educational achievement and (2) certification necessary to meet vocational entry requirements. These programs are designed to serve the people residing in the Model Cities area of Newark who are  undereducated, unemployed, and underemployed. Special efforts are made to serve minorities, veterans, and former correctional inmates. ABE has four objectives: (1) to improve the communicative, computational and social skills for adults whose inability to effectively use these skills substantially impairs their getting or retraining employment commensurate with their real ability; (2) to enhance their understanding of the free enterprise system in order to prepare them for their roles as productive citizens; (3) to interpret and relates students' educational accomplishments in order for them to observe educational relevance to their occupational training and their career objectives; and, (4) to help make possible for the students, the acquisition of his high school equivalency diploma  thus giving him a sense of personal and educational achievement.

Included under post-retirement are new careers begun by retirees bored with inactivity or by older persons who find pensions inadequate and need the additional income from wages. Volunteer work after retirement is also treated as a second career. Literature is included that discusses both men and women who  seek second careers during their working life, without any sex differentiation.

Life skills are defined as problem-solving behaviors appropriately and responsibly used in the management of personal affairs. They apply to the following areas of responsibility: self, family, leisure, community, and job. A course aimed at training people in the life skills implies that such skills are identifiable and describable, that some people already have these skills and can demonstrate them, that others can imitate and apply them. Much of the activity in a life skills course takes place in a learning group composed of about ten students and their learning guide, called a coach. During the course students participate in about 60 lessons which provide pre-planned experiences to which students apply  problem-solving techniques. Three process dimensions are involved: student response to content, student use of group, and problem-solving. The lesson model has five phases which suggest the approach used by the coach in presenting the lesson: stimulus, evocation, objective/inquiry/ skills preparation, application, and evaluation.

        "description":"If freedom of inquiry is a first criterion for assessing the educational undertaking from the vantage of a human resources approach, the second is understanding the varieties of human potential. Yet, except for athletic activity, American schools have concentrated almost exclusively on the development of cognitive skills. Our schools are belated in their efforts to identify, train, and reward young people with potentials for superior performance in nonacademic, nonathletic pursuits. A third criterion relates the educational system to the contribution it makes to increasing opportunities for self-development and career progression, and a fourth criterion relates to the resources invested in education and the effective utilization of those resources. There should be general unease  with the present situation because many students are bored and drop out, many students are the victims of inferior education, and increased educational expenditures are commonly opposed. There is also disagreement as to the role the school should play in transforming society. The new strategies to meet these criteria consist of nurturing children's natural curiosity, easing the transition from home to school, encouraging more State responsibility for the pupils' level of competence, linking school and the world of work, and making continuing education more attractive and accessible.

At the elementary level, teachers developed films, learning packets, games, and other career-oriented materials which will continue to be used throughout the school district. At the junior high school level, the  emphasis was on exploration of the fifteen career clusters, while at the high school level, the greatest effort was expended on career focus and placement. It was felt that the project successfully realized the objectives set out, and it will be continued and expanded throughout the Memphis school system.

Four levels of analyses (further definition of NIE program goals to include specific behaviors, definition of direct treatments to achieve goals, test treatments in a work situation, and adjust treatments after populations and contexts of program operation are analyzed) are combined in a fifth level where a complete program is presented. Answers to questions left unanswered by the model in the school-to-work context were sought using  measures in six areas: identifying and monitoring changes in the societal problem (using existing surveys); collecting data for hypothesis generation (using existing longitudinal studies); identifying and legitimizing desired outcomes (using an appropriate existing set of objectives); identifying and screening entering populations; ensuring integrity and replicability of treatments for individuals and institutions; and determining achievement of student outcomes and transfering control of evaluation to the students themselves.

The program has only administrative headquarters--the city is the classroom, as the students determine their goals in making school experience relevant to their life in the community. Free access to public transportation enables students to reach their classes. Staff members volunteer for the program and are selected  by a committee of Parkway teachers, students, parents, administrators, and community resource people. Originally funded by a Ford Foundation planning grant, the Program is now funded by the School District of Philadelphia. Presently the Program is organized in four 200-student units and offers between 100 and 200 courses.

Of the 78 percent response used in data analysis, about half of the teachers were 34 years of age or younger, almost 80 percent were married, and most reported the bachelor's as their highest degree. All were women and  most were fairly new to home economics teaching. Eighty-two percent reported work experience other than teaching home economics-related occupations, 49 percent in food service occupations. Responses indicated that about 30 percent would be very willing and about another 40 percent fairly willing to teach an occupational class because of the student employment opportunities.

Findings, reported by program areas, varied according to program. Occupational program alumni from 102 Illinois high schools provided questionnaire data. The 5,203 usable responses constituted 46.4 percent of the total number sent and 9 percent of  the total number of Illinois 1971 program completions. Another 2,651 responses were obtained from employers of alumni. Among the several recommendations for improving the followup system are: develop better identification of occupational programs and standardization of terms; appropriate funds for additional software; make the data available at appropriate times; discover new ways to relate subsequent employment to training taken; increase emphasis on career education; provide school district placement services; re-evaluate evaluative criteria; and base programs on job analysis.

Designed as a psychological education approach in which classes are a mixture of experiential and pragmatic activities, the seminar is divided into fourteen three-hour sessions. Class activities, highly structured and itemized in the manual, focus on community building, formation of psychological contracts, value clarification, meaning of work, instruction in occupational information, decision making, explorations, and future planning and evaluation. The siminar design assumes there is insufficient emphasis on understanding the world of work and one's relationship to it and that traditional approaches to occupational counseling  are less than effective. It further assumes that self-understanding is a legitimate realm of knowledge which should be included in the curriculum. The course has as its objectives: develop a minimum level of self-esteem and a positive attitude toward occupational development as a life process, learn how to explicate the personal meaning of different work activities, learn how to relate personal variables and reality variables to make effective decisions, and learn how to test decisions through tentative commitment.

Objectives were to evaluate each child's potential for acquiring functional skills, to instruct each child in vocational readiness skills, to assess each child's progress, and to determine the predictive value of teacher ratings and selected psychometric tests. The prevocational program consisted of three separate but interrelated phases: (1) activities of daily living, (2) service-maintenance tasks, (3) production-assembly. Each of these phases consisted of tasks which were further defined  into steps used in the evaluation of a child's competency level. Precision teaching techniques and one-to-one instruction were vital components of the program. Results indicated all of the children made noteworthy gains and that this model may be applicable to other populations. It was found that prevocational activities require careful selection and structure and that continual measurement is necessary. Parents of the children proved to be valuable members of the prevocation team; psychometric profiles were not predictively helpful.

The student body, who had studied under both semester and quarter systems, was surveyed as to personal preferences and opinions on advantages and disadvantages of the new system. Staff evaluation was conducted by personal interview with similar questions. Others contacted were industrial and business firms employing institute graduates, high schools providing the Institute student body, and the registrar's  office concerning transfers in and out of the Institute. Responses showed a similarity of opinions; the vast majority indicated a preference for the quarter system over the semester system. Advantages mentioned were greater scheduling flexibility, wider selection of electives and course offerings, more utilization of equipment and facilities, more opportunities to repeat missed or failed courses, and higher student interest and morale with a shortened time schedule, while disadvantages were increased grading and registration paper work and the possibility of students needing more textbooks.

Specific goals of this project were to initiate a sequential, pre-vocational course for slow learners covering basic math, practical aspects of money management, and reading skills. Additional goals were to develop student academic criteria for high school placement; to develop pre/post teacher attitude scales; to determine the effect of the experimental curriculum on daily attendance, dropout rate,  academic performance, social behavior, and teacher attitudes. Staff of the experimental group were two special education teachers and two full-time aides. Students in the control group received instruction in the regular classroom with no access to the specialized programs. In general, the results indicated difference in favor of the experimental group on all variables being measured. Recommendations were the development of more specific diagnostic and evaluative tools, use of larger student samples in future studies, and adoption of a State plan.

        "description":"The Center's Career and Curricula program bases its work upon a theory of career development. The report presents summaries of the theory upon which the program was based, of the work accomplished by the program, and of the research conducted. It also provides abstracts and ordering sources for the various reports completed. The theory assumes that, in our culture, most persons and environments fall into one of six categories: realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising, or conventional. It further assumes people search for environments that will let them exercise their skills and abilities, express their attitudes and values, and take on agreeable problems and roles. Lastly, it is assumed that a person's behavior is determined by an interaction between his  personality and the characteristics of his environment. The work accomplished by the program consists of theoretical studies, classification studies, applied studies, and related studies and influences. The title of each, its source, and a brief abstract are provided. The budget included $337,320 from the Federal government and $30,000 from the University. (Author/AG)",

        "description":"The University of Alabama successfully used the improvement of homemaking skills among disadvantaged families in an inner-city poverty pocket as a focus for a multidisciplinary approach to a three-year adult basic education (ABE) program when traditional ABE programs were rejected. The stated program goals were: (1) use the interest in improving homemaking skills to stimulate more responsible citizenship and to encourage individual participation in adult basic education programs; (2) develop models for the aggressive method of achieving individual involvement to motivate program participants toward responsible social and vocational goals; (3) reinforce community members in their daily lives; (4) help them be aware of the sources of help; (5) reach the inner-city's most  underprivileged adults; (6) enable the residents to vocalize their need for adult education; and (7) aid the homemakers in seeking new avenues of involvement with outside resources in the solution of their problems. Progress was made by dealing with the residents of Soul City on an individual basis using the city's Living-Learning Center as the focus for making the services of Federal, State, and local government agencies available together with those provided by the Univeristy and community volunteers. Various individual and group strategies were employed in increasing ABE impact. (AG)",

The general conclusions were that the program is meeting the needs of the participants and is contributing to the academic growth of pupils in reading. The participants, in general, were able to meet academic standards set by cooperating institutions. The purpose of COP is to provide opportunities for adults from low-income areas to pursue careers of useful service in education and to improve the educational opportunities of  pupils living in deprived areas. In Atlanta, COP-taught pupils' average reading gain was greater than one month per month of instruction. The academic performance of COP participants indicated the success of their training. COP participants have become more involved in instructional activities and placement in advanced positions took place according to the number of positions available. The effect of COP participants upon the self-concepts of pupils was not reflected in instrument scores. (Correspondence from COP graduates is included in the report appendix.) (AG)",

The research for that time is characterized by large-scale, static investigations and shows increasing concern for the dignity of the individual. It was concluded that past research is deficient in intensive and systematic field investigations, particularly in measuring QWL in terms of behaviors. Wages, hours, physical working conditions, meaningful and satisfying work, social support, control and influence, career opportunities, and the relationship between work and other parts of employees' lives are concepts included in an enlarged definition of QWL. Eleven QWL criteria (alienation, health and safety, economic  security, self-esteem, self-actualization, work environment, control and influence, organizational enclosure, career aspirations, and extra-work activities) were selected as major outcome variables to be studied which could be operationalized in behavioral terms while excluding attitudes per se. The state of the art is discussed in terms of time period, type of journal, and cross national research.

Questionnaires were administered to a sample of 300 educational practitioners in various roles in Kansas and Ohio. The data resulting from the 82 percent response are divided into two categories. One category studied was the innovation characteristics domain with a six-factor solution (student concern orientation, additional resource requirements, organized resistance potential, consumer report rating, credibility, and operational implementation concern) which accounted for 63 percent of the variance. The second category studied was the client characteristics domain. Its four-factor solution (the dynamic professional bureaucrat, the  adapter-creater, the impoverished practitioner, and the economic bureaucrat) accounted for 48 percent of the variance. The study, as it has progressed thus far, suggests that individuals concerned with introducing and/or implementing innovations should be prepared to deal with the reactions of clients to various perceived characteristics of that innovation. The study further suggests that persons dealing with change in educational settings should consider the individual's patterns of behavior when he is attempting to understand and/or gain the adoption of innovations.

The main characteristics of MPS are analyzed from a systems perspective and organizational resources and structure of services for the hard to employ are surveyed. It is pointed out that, following the systems perspective, changes in the supportive subsystem will not produce immediate results in the service patterns but that new operative goals and service technology are needed for both clients and employers. The basic change strategy should be to expand the operative goals of the agency with the twofold aim of improving its services and increasing its importance in  the community. An intelligence system is proposed which would fulfill three related functions: to monitor the external relevant environment of the agency, to provide an internal audit of staff and client activities, and to evaluate the agency's outputs. The effectiveness of MPS is dependent upon its ability to develop a multilevel service delivery system that breaks away from the narrow conception of matching persons with jobs. (Author/SA)",

The study was based on a review of the literature, in field interviews, and in-depth correspondence with knowledgeable management and union practitioners; findings are limited to the arbitration step in contract administration. Twenty points of indictment of grievance arbitration and arbitrators were compiled and specific remedies were suggested, with a consensus being reached on some points and substantial disagreement ensuing from other points. Consensus included: desirability of shorter opinions stressing reasoning behind awards; urging arbitrators to take firm charge of hearings; charging of a reasonable fee if hearing is cancelled; a shortage exists of competent  and experienced arbitrators; scepticism regarding the utility of submission arguments; and negative attitudes on some proposed reforms. Pre-arbitration suggestions include: that arbitrators receive pertinent information in advance, and that unreasonable delay in scheduling defeats one of the fundamental purposes of grievance arbitration. Greater arbitrator initiative, additional practitioner contributions to improving the process, and joint efforts by practitioners, arbitrators, and designating agencies toward continued improvement of the grievance arbitration process are recommended. A list of practitioner rights of expectation from the arbitrator is presented. (SC)",

Results of some past projects are organized and summarized for evaluation, reference, and follow-up purposes. A summary of recent projects at the University of Washington and Central Washington State College are outlined as to schools, number working on project, grade level, program length, and also are coded for output and elements of the program. A more complete summary is included of fifty projects at Washington State University which lists prime objective, grade  levels, activity and description, short/long-range outcomes, and persons to contact. The latter summaries cover a variety of topics such as vocational awareness, self-concept, attitudes, students' job knowledge, decision-making, individual interests and aptitudes, occupational exploration, course selection, career planning, vocational guidance for special students, vocational orientation, and work experience programs. An outline summary of career awareness programs throughout Washington State is also included that ranges from grades K-14 and covers activity, special interest features, and persons to contact.

A variety of methods was used to implement the program: teacher-made lesson plans, &quot;hands on&quot; activities, and in-service workshops among others. The most effective method was the utilization of community resources. As a result of the program, career education has won acceptance within all phases of the school system and the community. Curriculum guides have been developed, resource centers established, and student awareness of career opportunities has increased markedly. External evaluation (in &quot;on-site&quot; visitations) and internal evaluation (in the form of various instruments)  have been continuous.

A third theme was the challenge presented to the creative teacher by the growing sensitivity to multiple life-styles, cultures, and values that exist in every classroom and community.

Program integration was sought between the college and high school instructors by sharing and developing materials so that the articulation between the two groups would be facilitated. An audiovisual coordinator served as a consultant and media developer for all occupational areas and all grade levels within the K-14 exemplary program. Over 124 individual presentations were made of the material developed, including slide-tapes, video-tapes, and talking books. Career counseling was initiated at the  community college through testing, individual student counseling, and a follow-up of career orientation through exposure to career clusters by video-tapes and slide-tapes. Specific guidance and counseling materials were also developed into slide-tape presentations.

There was also a real  difference between mean level of significance in the task analysis and questionnaire portions of the study, and there were no real correlations between frequency of tasks actually performed and the reported levels of significance for those tasks.

        "description":"The education and training provision set out in this recommendation are designed to develop suitable entrants to electricity boards for responsibilities as engineers in generation and transmission in Great Britain. The first objective is therefore to provide the trainee with the knowledge necessary to undertake a specific appointment immediately after training in the operation and maintenance or the development and construction aspects of generation, or in transmission. From such appointments he will develop both in confidence and in ability, and it is to be expected that trainees who have undertaken studies in engineering to degree or equivalent level may quickly gain sufficient experience to make them suitable for wider responsibilities. Thus a second objective must be to  provide a wider understanding of the principles and practice of generation and transmission, together with supervisory and management techniques which will, as an engineer's career develops, enable him to build up knowledge and experience in whichever field of generation or transmission he enters. The layout of the recommendation follows the same lines as that for recommendation 31 (CE 001 038) dealing with technical training. Typical programs for professional engineering training in generation and transmission are given in the appendix. (Author/DS)",

Since the task of vocational educators is to prepare students for successful employment, it is necessary that vocational programs include instruction and activities that develop both job skills and personal and leadership abilities. This instructor's guide is intended to assist in the development of a curriculum which will meet these objectives. A personal and leadership instructional package for vocational students makes up three-fourths of the guide. It is divided into four sections: personal development, social  attributes, leadership skills, and job knowledge. Within each section the material is presented in four columns: performance goal, required knowledge, learning activities, and references and aids. (Author/SA)",

Data from a questionnaire sent to 208 former students and an information sheet with data from the files of the Office of the Associate Dean for Instruction, College of Agriculture, determined that most graduates chose Texas A and M because of the academic standards and were influenced by teachers of vocational agriculture in their choice of college and major field. Most of the graduates had agriculture backgrounds, and 27.6 percent entered vocational agriculture teaching as their  employment. At the time of the study, 23.7 percent were still teaching vocational agriculture, but governmental service replaced teaching of other subjects as the second-largest area of employment. The inability to find a teaching position led 32.8 percent to enter other professions. Median salary ranged from $5,136 at first employment to $8,852 at the time of the study. Adding business management courses to the curriculum was suggested by 77.5 percent. Seventy-three percent said student teaching had helped them in their present occupation. (AG)",

(1) Factors influencing students to major in agriculture were: college teachers for the changers, parents and vocational agriculture teachers for the non-changers. Experience factors influenced both groups. (2) Stability of choice of curricula was associated with the size of high  school graduating classes (students from smaller classes changing less frequently), with the size of the hometown (percent of non-changers inversely related to size), and with the student's satisfaction with the person influencing the selection of the University and with the person influencing the choice of major.

Chapters considered to be highly successful had significantly higher ratings assigned to the importance of young farmer chapters by advisors, younger members, more members who had completed high school and had one college degree, and more members engaged in an agricultural occupation other than production agriculture.  There were also more meetings with more people in attendance, more community service activities, and more resource people used in teaching in the high level chapters. Finally, there were significantly more teachers of vocational agriculture employed in the schools where chapters were ranked high.

        "description":"The behaving organism is described as a system with internal motivational and memory components which guide the actions of external input and output components. The organism actively shapes its environment by using its output to control its input from the environment. Output is a function of the psychological forces, topographic memory, and input contemporaneous with output. Behavior is the relationship between output and input. Behavior change is seen as a function of changes in the internal state of the organism. The phenomena of random, trial and error, and direct effectance behavior, centrality, learning performance, attention, chaining and symbolism are explored from this framework. The behavior of persons is described in terms of social behavior shaping through chaining and  symbolism. Means of changing the behavior of persons are suggested. (Author)",

        "description":"In the study of the effectiveness of traditional methods of evaluation (high school GPA and SAT scores) and subjective methods of evaluation (self, peer, parent, counselor, and teacher perceptions) in predicting the academic performance of 47 disadvantaged college freshmen, traditional methods proved inadequate. Among the subjective methods, peer prediction was found to be significantly related to the disadvantaged student's academic performance. Counselors achieved the dubious distinction of having the poorest \"track record\" in estimating the academic performance of the students. Study results suggest that the more hours disadvantaged students attempt, the higher their achieved GPA. This finding tends to refute the assumption that disadvantaged students perform better  academically when they carry reduced class loads. (Author)",

Surveys were sent to 36 institutions, including all junior and senior colleges in the three counties and a random sampling of cosmetology, barber and private occupational schools. Intent of the survey was to gauge effectiveness of the two programs. Conclusions regarding the Advance Payment program indicate: (1) junior and senior colleges are pleased with the intent of the program but dissatisfied with the functional aspects; (2) the majority of the career schools do not know about the program; and (3)  only 25% of those veterans eligible to participate in the program actually apply. Regarding the Work-Study program, results indicate that all the institutions consider this program unsatisfactory, with only 21 veterans in the entire area benefiting from it. These conclusions suggest the need for additional information on new programs at a stage where remediation is possible. (Author/HMW)",

An equal number (40) of male and female college students were rated on self-disclosure in interviews with either male or female interviewers of high or low status. Results indicate that: (1) males disclose more to females while females disclose more to males; (2) dyads containing a female result in more disclosure than all-male dyads; (3) males reveal more to high status interviewers, while females tend to disclose more to low status interviewers; and (4) high as opposed to  low status male interviewers elicit more disclosure from all subjects, while the status of female interviewers results in no significant differences.

Newly acquired  skills were reinforced in small, group study sessions which were also used to improve self-perception through interaction and self-evaluation. Results suggest that: (1) one-fourth of the college students whose college careers have been ended because of academic failures can be rehabilitated; (2) reading and study skill courses have value; (3) small group counseling combined with practical application of study skills can result in academic achievement.

The social-learning approach is divided into five steps: (1) defining the problem in terms of behavior in specific situations; (2) specifying behavioral objectives to be reached; (3) making observations and noting the frequency of occurrence of the target behavior, its antecedents, and its consequences; (4) forming a plan of intervention by contingency reinforcement of desireable behaviors and by arrangement of situations which increase the probability of the client performing  desireable behaviors; and (5) evaluating, maintaining, or adjusting and, finally, terminating the intervention program. The speech also describes celeration, a precise system of behavioral measurement which deals with the number of responses per unit of time. An instrument (the Standard Behavior Chart) utilizes these behavioral units so as to permit direct comparisons between different variables effecting behavioral change. (Author/LKP)",

Recommendations which emerged from the data are that: official recognition should be given to students who have successful part-time work experience, over time, by means of academic credit or by notation of work on official transcripts; and the employed student should be considered a prime reference source in establishment and maintenance of career education and development programs.

It features a process in which each phase provides feedback to preceding phases or input to subsequent planning activities. The set of programs that results is systematic; that is, each part is interrelated, and interacts with the others. Each resulting program focuses on the needs and characteristics of youth from which measureable objectives emerge. The approach is comprehensive because it includes  both a developmental phase to prevent potential problems and a prescriptive phase to alleviate existing problems. Also included is a detailed outline of a four-phase comprehensive approach that might be considered for developing each program.

The results of this survey are compared with data from earlier surveys in this program which has been conducted since 1965. The most dramatic trend evident in recent surveys is the increasing proportion of students who enter the labor force after grade 12. While the total number of students in post-secondary training continued to diminish in 1972, the percentage of those students attending a university rose sightly. However, there does not appear to be any significant pattern in the relationship between the percentages choosing vocational training and those choosing academic training.  (Author)",

Subjects responded to pre-course, post-course, and followup questionnaires dealing with their attitudes toward groups and the actual group experience, and behavioral change attributable to the group experience. Significant others were used in the followup to either corroborate or deny the self-perceptions of the group participants. Participant attitudes toward encounter groups became markedly more positive after they had undergone a group experience, and an overwhelming majority of them felt that the course should be taught as a sensitivity or encounter group. Participants reported behavioral changes as a result of the group experience, and the vast  majority described the overall impact of the group as helpful, constructive, or deeply meaningful; moreover, the group experience seems to have had a lasting effect on the participants. On the basis of the finding of this study, the encounter group appears to be valuable as a training experience for counselors. (Author/LKP)",

A questionnaire of 28 items was constructed, field-tested and mailed to 425 professional high school counselors within the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Completed questionnaires were returned by 290 counselors. Analysis of the data indicated the responding counselors were unknowledgeable about the various factors relating to adolescent suicide.

The conference was the first phase of the Disadvantaged Series of developmental conferences held at the University of Pittsburgh in 1969. Participants included 12 scientists from social, psychological, and educational disciplines. The objective of this Conference was to develop a model for the retrieval of information dealing with the successfully assessment of the socially handicapped and incorporate this into training packets. Suggested sources of information included; (1) counselors; (2) socially disadvantaged clients; (3) paraprofessionals working in the rehabilitation field; and (4) individuals in  public and private agencies. A prototype training model is outlined which includes three primary subsystems;: (1) an information subsystem which includes the retrieval, validation and organization of information; (2) a developmental subsystem, including the identification of goals, the development of a plan, and evaluation; and (3) an evaluation subsystem to provide summative information useful in revising the training packet.

This model assumed that individuals allocate the causes of success and failure to four elements (ability, effort, luck and task difficulty), and that each of these causal attributions would produce different behavioral and emotional reactions. Other studies (Bar-Tal and Frieze, 1973; Kukla, 1972; Weiner and Kukla, 1970; and Weiner and Potepan, 1970) have demonstrated that high and low achievement motivation subgroups display differential causal attributional patterns which may explain their varying responses to achievement situations. These findings indicate the need for better understanding and  modification of attributional patterns of individuals low in achievement motivation. Possible ways of initiating such changes are reviewed in the context of the educational process. (Author)",

The purpose of the present work was to test this interpretation by investigating subjects who read from right-to-left (Israelis whose native reading language is Hebrew). Contrary to expectations, the Israeli college students showed greater accuracy for the left visual field and tended to organize a series of items in a left-to-right direction. The investigation was extended to several groups of children, and a tentative picture of the development of an \"attentiveness to the  left\" was obtained. (Author/LL)",

The relationship between intelligence--as assessed by an individual measuring instrument, such as the Stanford-Binet--and reading is at least minimized if the difficulty of the task is within the capabilities of the learner, individual differences in rate of learning are taken into account, instruction is organized to facilitate sequential learning, directions are given clearly so that all students understand them, and assessment of progress is based on criterion-referenced tests. On the other hand, if all of these variables are at the other extremes  of their continua, and particularly if group tests of intelligence and criterion-referenced tests of reading achievement are used, then the relationship between intelligence and reading tends to be maximized.

Rather than teaching specific comprehension skills in an abstract, formulistic manner separated from the immediate demands of content area reading, it is more realistic to teach pupils a flexible, generalized approach to comprehension tasks which can be applied directly in a variety of contextual settings. The specific demands of content area reading require pupils to apply comprehension skills in different ways, depending on the nature of the content material being read and the pupils' purpose for reading it. As pupils grow in their  ability to analyze and solve comprehension tasks in different content areas, their ability to use the skills appropriate for comprehension in these areas will develop concomitantly.

An attempt must be made to correct this dual, confusing role that far too many children feel they must play. Some teachers unknowingly react to children in prejudiced ways. The wise teacher of reading will cherish youth first and skills in reading second. He will behave quite differently from the teacher who cherishes things, materials, and skills first as his own particular value pattern. Whatever teachers do at school, if children value it, they will learn it. Thus, it humbles  all of us when we realize that the burden of responsibility is on our own shoulders to see to it that youth is experiencing the right types of reading, thinking, and value-oriented activities.

Basal series, grades three, four, five, and six, were reviewed to find stories that would determine the need for this study. One state from each of ten Health, Education and Welfare regions in the continental United States was randomly selected as the  representative area. From the state-adopted lists of six of these states, five representative basal reader series were randomly selected: the Sheldon Basic Reading Series, the READ Series, the Ginn Basic Reading Series, the Harper and Row Basic Reading Series, and Lippincott Basic Reading Series. The results indicated that the percentage of stories pertaining to blacks is non-representative of the population, more stories in basals should be written by black authors, and racial incidents were not accurately recorded in four of the five stories.

        "description":"There is a place in every classroom for individualized reading. A common-content-based approach can be employed at any grade level, provided appropriate modifications are made. The initial step is to tell the students that soon they will be choosing their own books to read. After that they are asked to try to think of the types of things about which they might read that might be found in one form or another in everyone's reading material, even though they might all be reading different things. With not much prompting, most classes can usually identify a list of characteristics common to people, such as love, wisdom, understanding, patience, and hatred. After discussing the terms and possibly constructing operational definitions for them, the children are asked to begin reading  materials of their choice and to record as accurately as possible the page that contains an example of the characteristics listed. After the termination of the reading sessions, the teacher should present each pupil with a tally sheet containing a list of the human characteristics that were considered. (WR)",

Questionnaires were sent to 42 master's graduates from the graduate degree program in reading who graduated from 1968 through 1973. The college's catalog of courses was used to specify objectives of the graduate degree program in reading. Each catalog course description was studied to extrapolate objectives. A total of 28 course objectives reflecting this extrapolation procedure were constructed. A five-point rating scale was assigned to each item. Some of the results indicated that the differences between  reading specialists' and classroom teachers' assessments of objectives reflecting required and elective courses and applied and theoretical information were not significant. Both groups rated objectives reflecting applied information highest and objectives reflecting theoretical information lowest, and classroom teachers rated the objectives from three of four areas higher than reading specialists did.

In the first experiment the PRNI effect was examined from a developmental standpoint, using 160 subjects selected from middle-class settings and evenly divided on the basis of age into four groups: preschool, second grade, sixth grade, and adult. Two lists of unrelated words were constructed for each age group and presented orally at a one-second rate with a one-second interval between words. Subjects were allowed unlimited time for free oral recall. In the second experiment 20 males and 20 females with an  average age of 4.7 were used as subjects. The procedures were the same as in the first experiment, with one exception. The subjects were instructed on how to use a PRNI strategy. The findings indicated an absence of PRNI at the preschool level and the presence of PRNI at the elementary and adult levels. Also, the fact that the amount of PRNI is related to age is supportive of the idea PRNI reflects the use of a relatively sophisticated learning strategy. (WR)",

Extrapolating neural consolidation theory to previous work on serial position effects led to the predictions that (1) arousal facilitates primacy; (2) arousal inhibits recency; (3) arousal facilitates primacy increasingly with a longer exposure time; (4) arousal inhibits recency less with a longer exposure time. It was also predicted that (5) increased exposure time facilitates primacy. Although arousal significantly facilitated recall over both exposure times, none of the predictions were supported. Several analyses suggested that the arousal effect was not a function of differential clustering  within list types. The results were interpreted as consistent with the claim that word arousal facilitates recall primarily through an increase in autonomic, but not necessarily cortical, arousal. (Author)",

The teacher of a content area should guide his students in the application of basic skills and study methods to the materials used. A second pitfall is the assumption, often made by the unskilled teacher of reading, that the best place to begin reading instruction is the extensive training in phonics. The good reader combines phonic skills, context clues, and sight vocabulary. A third pitfall is the tendency to teach reading as if this highly complex mental activity required little more than just a bag of devices. The possibilities for improving the teaching of reading should include putting into practice the teaching of reading  as a process. The discerning teacher of a content area uses in part the student's self as content, thereby placing the teaching of reading as a process in as broad a context as possible. A second and related possibility for improving reading instruction in the content areas is the building of instruction upon significant leads from linguistics. A third possibility is bridging the gap between the spoken language, experiences, and the variety of patterns within printed language. (WR)",

        "description":"The grapho-linguistic approach to teaching reading involves the labeling of self-initiated graphic images reinforced by the copying of the written labels, which helps the child to understand the transference of meaning from the object to its name to its written name. The best time to start labeling strategies is when the child draws recognizable images and demonstrates horizontality. A child who is actively trying to learn the signs attached to objects is demonstrating that he has discovered the symbolic function of the written word. After proving successful in Washington, D. C., the grapho-linguistic approach to teaching reading now appears to hold the greatest promise for laying a good reading foundation based on the following factors: (1) drawing comes as naturally to a child  as walking, talking, and playing; (2) the child invests his drawings with meaning; (3) the child who is helped to realize that he can convert verbal images into graphic images is preparing himself to convert graphic images into alphabetic images or words; (4) since reading cannot take place until speech is converted into written symbols, then handwriting should be the intermediary step between drawing and reading; and (5) the drawing paper becomes the ideal medium whereby to effect this exchange.

The areas of learning difficulty for the children discussed include listening, speaking, reading, lack of experiences, high mobility, immediate physical needs, and abstractions. The characteristics of basal readers discussed which cause learning problems include the vocabulary load placed on the child, deferring the teaching of vowel sounds to second grade, lack of sufficient practice in skills learned in different settings, gaps in instruction, teaching too many things at once, and dependence on  assumptive teaching. Conditions discussed which promote optimal learning include the presentation of tasks in segments, teaching in the easiest possible sequence, progression determined by mastery, transfer of skills, repetition of learned skills, and immediate and valued reinforcement. Practical suggestions for instruction include the use of the language experience approach, which can involve teaching phonics and word recognition skills to avoid many of the problems present in basal readers.

Some specific suggestions for each of the steps include: (1) taping radio advertisements and encouraging the students to determine to which basic needs the message appeals, (2) reducing advertisements to writing to facilitate the identification of the persuasion technique being used, (3) providing the students with criteria to judge advertising propaganda, and (4) discussing in small groups or  individually whether or not a particular advertised product should be bought.

        "description":"One of the major objectives of all schools is to help each student become an independent reader. By necessity then, the teacher, the materials utilized in the teaching process, and the classroom organization used must help students learn and gain proficiency in applying basic reading skills to the reading of all types of materials. To achieve the goal of developing basic reading skills, the teacher should consider at least six major areas: assessment of reading skills, materials utilized, classroom organization, sequential development of word recognition skills, development of comprehension skills, and application of study skills. The major comprehension skills which teachers should develop involve locating information, recalling information, organizing information, interpreting  and extending information, reviewing, and applying learning.

The first priority in improving reading instruction is the identification of minimal sets of skills and knowledge necessary for acceptable reading competence at several stages of development in the reading process. The second priority is the identification of critical program factors by researchers and educators, based on available research and conventional wisdom. The third priority includes the development of test instruments that more adequately measure how a child uses his reading skills and that pinpoint the operation of the independent processes that go into reading. The fourth priority is small scale model research on the effect of critical factors on reading instruction. The  fifth priority is an analysis of the availability of human resources. The sixth priority is basic research on reading. (LL)",

        "description":"This study attempted to increase the reading efficiency of normal readers by developing a method of producing telegraphic prose. The subjects' (undergraduate students in psychology) rank ordered the words in each sentence of a prose passage according to the importance of the words for communicating the main sentence idea. Specific treatment conditions were five subject-generated reductions and five computer-generated random reductions consisting of a 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% deletion of words from each sentence in the passage. Variables included comprehension, reading rate, required reading time, and an efficiency measure. For any of the four variables there were no significant differences in comprehension between the traditional version and the reduced versions generated by  either the random or subjective deletion schemes at the 10% deletion level. Results also showed that the subject-generated versions of 30% and 40% deletion saved a significant amount of reading time when compared to the traditional version, that there were no significant differences in comprehension between these versions and the traditional version, and that both deleted versions were more efficient than the traditional version. These results supported the feasibility of the telegraphic concept based on a subject deletion scheme. (HOD)",

Confluent education refers to the concept of teaching a person through both cognitive and affective processes. Nine elements must be present in the teaching situation in order for confluent education to exist: responsibility--the ability to respond creatively and positively to any situation; convergency--relating and experiencing what is done or what is happening to the self; connectedness--a sense of positive affiliation with others; divergency--relating and experiencing what is happening in the world to the educational experience; power--a sense of personal control over what is happening or will happen; gestalt--gaining closure (satisfaction) through  positive frustration and explication; identity--a feeling of self-worth, self-esteem, and ego identity; context-learning to understand communications through general semantics and environment; and evaluation--eliciting individuals' opinions concerning values.

The task of the journalism school is to keep up with the demand for more and better graduates with basic news reporting skills. To achieve this goal strict requirements should be maintained. Today, as a result of curriculum changes and new policies, the journalism graduate is not as well prepared as were his predecessors of a decade or more ago. Not only do the  journalism schools no longer have the solid and purposeful curricula they once had, they no longer have the highly qualified faculties of years past.

Previous studies have treated the growth of circulation figures by utilizing gross national data and have indicated the role newspaper circulation plays in defining the limits of major urban centers. In one study a number of test newspapers were coded by strata, census region, level of newspaper competition, and level of local competition. The regions involved ranged from suburban to large metropolitan areas. Over 39 percent of each stratum as sampled on a random basis. Findings show no important variation in penetration of the newspaper dailies from 1940 to 1970. In 1970 newspapers were reaching about the same percentage of homes  as they were in 1940, although there were variations in the regions. The biggest decline was in the circulation of daily newspapers in the highly populated areas, although revenues in the same areas were up. Sunday editions registered a gain of about 10 percent. Despite the stiff competition from television and other media, the daily newspaper in the United States is still flourishing. (DS)",

When approached from the point of view of the students' experience, this oral tradition can be an effective springboard for discussion, reading, and writing in the classroom. Brass band funeral processions can be viewed as a close structural parallel to the form of classical elegy and a study of commemorative poetry written by or about blacks can be used to complement the jazz funeral-elegy comparison. Tracing the development of a character in oral literature such as Brer Rabbit can also be an effective approach; or one can trace the theme of what makes a hero. One successful unit was developed from a historical perspective to trace the black man's  philosophies of freedom using folk music and poetry. The oral literature of the black community explains the present condition as the result of the past and establishes a definite relationship between the actions and reactions of the black man's ancestors to the conflicts in their lives. The oral literature is a continuing tradition, so that much of the teaching material can consist of the experiences and knowledge of oral literature that black students bring to the classroom.

In fact the average classroom offers a vast supply of information about nonverbal communication that remains relatively untouched in scientific studies. The processes of acceptance and understanding of ideas and actions on the part of both students and teachers involve expensive nonverbal elements. The teacher interested in improving his own communication skills will find the classroom a place for practice and exploration. Some possible areas of concentration include an examination and interpretation of different students' reactions to questioning techniques, the development of groups and social interaction  in the classroom, the examination of cultural clashes that occur as a result of different uses of nonverbal behavior, the study of the effects of dress and hair styles on teacher-student interaction, and the analysis of seating arrangements and architectural design as it affects classroom communication.

At the conclusion of these units the first electives are offered: three electives in the language skill area, two writing electives, and novel and drama electives including a unit on science  fiction. Electives are usually three weeks long with the student returning to the home-base teacher for conferences at the conclusion of the elective. A common period for teachers involved in planning, coordinating, and executing mini-mod electives is also arranged.

        "description":"The purpose of the project was to develop and validate a computer-assisted literacy development program for career oriented youth, ages 14-24. This goal has been accomplished so that there now exists a model for a total computerized reading program for young adults. The end product of this program consists of adult diagnostic reading level tests, an occupational interest inventory, and instruction in literacy and occupational information. Several stages of development were required to produce the LITE program on the IBM 1500 Instructional System. The summative evaluation of the program showed that students participating in the LITE program made considerable gains in their literacy development and outstanding gains in their knowledge of career information. The attitude of students  in the computer-assisted instruction (CAI) mode of the program was significantly better than the attitude of students taking a programed text version of the program. Since the LITE program is successful, it is suggested that funds become available to bring the program to a large number of students, that materials on the world of work and code-breaking skills be brought to special education and adult basic education persons, and that the career information areas be further developed to meet the vocational needs of career-oriented youths.

Upon entering school, the child should be taught through the medium of his own language and should have a special intensive English (as a second language) course as well as a special course in Spanish for native speakers of Spanish. When the student's command of English reaches the point where he can study other courses in English, the shift can begin, usually with math and science, but the sequence of courses in  Spanish for native speakers should continue throughout the school years. And in a truly bilingual setting, the English-speaking child should study oral Spanish and later study math or science using Spanish as the medium of instruction.

The novel's structure is somewhat elusive in the character study seems to be the controlling factor, but the concept of time also plays an important role in its development. The novel is historical and records detailed events,  human sensibilities, emotions, and conflicts, and thus requires that the interpretative reader have extensive background information. The reader who interprets this novel must use his imagination to convey a feeling of its humorous and poignant testimony to human endurance. (RN)",

The Populist Party thrived in isolated rural areas, particularly the Dakota territories, at a time when residents were seeking political force to organize for statehood. The party also served as a platform for farmers to express their dissatisfaction with the distant industrial, business, and economic interests that they felt controlled them. Persuasive appeals were based on political and economic discontent, a fear of natural conditions and failure, and the isolated farmers' needs for social interaction. As community centers were established, there  were increasing occasions for face-to-face communication. Persuasive dialogues occurred during such meetings as summer encampments and conventions, chautaquas, lyceums, and particularly political rallies. As a reform movement, populism reached its climax in South Dakota in 1896 when the party slate was elected. (RN)",

The primary purpose of women's studies is the eventual elimination of sexism in both academia and society.

The communication strategies of the women's liberation movement reject standard rhetorical traditions of formal addresses by experts and an elected leadership. The movement instead favors leaderless structure and &quot;consciousness raising&quot; small group discussions. The women's liberation movement in speech communication courses should, however, involve more male participation because courses taught by  women, about women, and for women cannot reverse sexist trends in the educational system.

Instructional technology must also be interactive so that students' questions and statements can be related to the technological devices. In addition, liberal arts instructional methodology must provoke an understanding and criticism of the socio-political environment and allow students some degree  of reflective distance from specific topics (as provided in writing assignments or analyses of film, video, and audio recordings).

Further, they have an emotional impact that is often greater than that of language. It is essential that the teacher of English deal with this non-language bias since it is his job to help students develop the capacity to analyze, understand, and use the media through which society communicates. It is essential that the teacher allow the student to be placed in the position of making some hypothetical decisions that will result in a biased picture; that he encourage participation in the kinds of activities that will develop a student's ability to use the non-language elements of mass media in communicating  a message or describing people and events; that he request the student to compare and analyze his own decisions and those of other students who participated in the above activities; and that he encourage the student to critically analyze cases, patterns, and possible effects of photograph selection by the mass media.

The major question explored how much variance of immediate recall and student-teacher interaction is attributable to course attitudes and instructor valence. Student grade point averages were used as a control. Two propositions were tested: (1) that dimensions of course attitudes, instructor credibility, attraction, and homophily are significantly related to immediate recall, and (2) that dimensions of course attitude, instructor credibility, attraction, and homophily are significantly related to student-teacher interaction. Involvement, competence, homophily, task attraction, and grade point averages were  positively related to recall; social attraction was negatively related. Out-of-class information-seeking interaction between student and teacher was found to be positively related to involvement, character, extroversion, and social attraction, but negatively related to importance, competence, and homophily.

Semiotics and structural analysis promise some advances in media studies, but these methods are limited when applied to peculiar qualities of time in film and television. A more fruitful approach includes a consideration of existential and experiential media phenomena. If existential phenomena (light, space, time, motion, and sound) are juxtaposed with the experiential (the instantaneousness and irrevocability of \"media moments,\" the irreducibility of experience, and media event context), it is possible to begin to make deeper, meaningful observations about the basic theory of various forms of media.

        "description":"The creative and accurate interpretation of phenomena is central to achieving an understanding of the world and our fellow man. However, the process of interpretation is little understood by behavioral scientists and educators. Hermeneutics promises greater insight into the nature of interpretation of phenomena since the foundation of a hermeneutic stance transfers the point of attention in analytic tasks from causal, psychological explanations of behavior to a position which keeps clear an understanding of the existential nature of the self within social environments. Research into interpretive understanding must adopt such a hermeneutic stance in order to expand current conceptions of human psychology. (CH)",

        "description":"Irregularities in oral fluency, or &quot;disfluencies,&quot; are common in the speech habits of both children and adults. Disfluencies can take the form of hesitations, revisions, repetitions, or interjections. Most disfluenceies do not occur at random, but are directly linked to other factors such as verbal planning--the combination of decisions a speaker must make during the communication process--word choice, grammatical structure, and the level of abstraction, or &quot;ideation level,&quot; whereby statements are classified as a simple enumeration of objects, a verbalized description of objects, or an interpretive conclusion. Forty preschool children were asked to describe what they saw in a series of photographs, and their responses were analyzed on ideation levels. Results indicated that  verbal planning is directly related to the frequency of speech disfluencies and that more disfluencies occurred at the descriptive level than at the interpretive level. Differences at the enumerative level were not significant. Differences between males and females or middle class and lower class children were not significant, although middle class males produced more disfluencies than middle class females. (RN)",

Editorial comments are included, as well as issues where a firm decision had been reached in order to reflect the thoughts and feelings of the educational field should these issues be reconsidered at some point in the future. In addition, a summary of responses is provided for each major interest or occupation area represented, such as educational researchers and school board members to determine any major differences between areas and to make data available regarding the particular  concerns of such groups. The major issues of concern as summarized from all the replies resolve around the structure of NIE--its organization and its relationship to existing agencies and the director and staff. Concerns regarding the substantive plans for NIE center on educational research, the linkage of research and development with practice, the objectives of NIE, and the education of educational personnel. Those issues receiving little attention were the evaluation of NIE itself, curriculum, comparative education, higher education, foundations of education, and the transition from NCERD to NIE.

This direct data source, in conjunction with the Rand experience in the field of analysis for educational planning and resource management, provides the base for the substance of this report. Three major management considerations are identified: (1) planning the performance contracting program, (2) organizing to effectively  manage the operation of the program, and (3) developing the capability to evaluate the results of the program in terms of its comparative cost and effectiveness. The paper includes a summary description of the experiences in several districts and a discussion of the role of three State departments of education.

The main proposals are (1) income tax deductions as an incentive system for more equal educational opportunity; (2) an experiment in voting methods designed to improve the level and composition of resources in education; (3) the improvement of public control over resource allocation in education; (4)  the collection, evaluation, and dispersion of education information; and (5) a program for full-costing of higher education.

Educational problems and needs that were culled from a variety of sources are categorized as being either chronic, acute, or adaptive in nature. The reasoning underlying this approach is that while chronic problems need some attention and acute problems seem most demanding, the prevention of problems from becoming acute should be a key consideration in R&amp;D programing. The importance of adaptive  problems (the stresses resulting from the rapid rate of change in virtually all sectors of society) is that they offer identifiable areas that have not yet, but that are likely to, become acute without corrective attention.

Approaches are needed that will both decentralize the conduct of educational R&amp;D to the extent feasible and educate for flexibility, a high degree of tolerance of differences, and the ability to cope with varied cultural norms; (2) the anticipation of &quot;adaptive&quot; problems that have not yet become acute is a  necessary part of R&amp;D planning, given the long lead-time required before R&amp;D products become mature; (3) many of the most critical problems of education and society are systemic in nature, hence may well be intractable by conventional piecemeal or centralized &quot;top-down&quot; approaches involving only one sector of society; and (4) coordinated public-private and multiagency approaches are therefore likely to be increasingly necessary. The report focuses on the development of research programs in the societal context of education; increasing the effectiveness of the educational R&amp;D system; multiorganizational coordination; and anticipatory identification of education-related problems.

In order for National Institute of Education (NIE) to effect change, there must be a true dialogue. In other words, the research users, parents, students, teachers, and school officials must have a chance to give NIE their ideas. While the author believes that NIE planners are committed to utilization in some sense, he is concerned that there is no coherent plan for actualizing this commitment. Although no master plan is submitted, some principles that such a plan should incorporate are proposed. (Author/JF)",

It considers the educational goals to be achieved, variables that can be manipulated to reach the goals, the current practice and status of R&amp;D on the variables, new R&amp;D programs that might lead to goal achievement, and NIE management and budget recommendations for programs. The research and development programs are divided into basic research, improvement of current educational practices, activities to build R&amp;D capability, and programs to solve major educational problems. The paper provides a detailed discussion and analysis of broad educational goals that are further divided into learner goals, enabling goals, and system goals. The  criteria for selection of new programs for NIE is also presented. The document gives a detailed description of specialty area and comprehensive NIE programs along with an estimated budget allocation for fiscal years 1972 and 1973. The programs described cover such topics as instructional personnel; curriculum; organizational change; planning, management, and evaluation technologies; experimental schools; career education; home-based early education; learner-controlled education; &quot;unbundling&quot; of higher education; and community education agencies.

It first examines the domain of education in the United States, considering the objectives of education and the role of the formal educational system in its relation to all the societal sources of education. Brief presentations are made of the evidence in the most serious areas of failure to meet educational goals. NIE subgoals to help improve the quality of education -- providing a rigorous intellectual challenge, expanding opportunities for students to experience effectual action, reintegrating schooling and &quot;real life&quot;, fostering educational diversity, and encouraging  articulation of the goals and process of education -- are then defined and examined. Examined next are NIE subgoals for acquiring more authentic knowledge of the poor child; adapting educational practices to the realities of home, community and peer interactions; and responding to heightened awareness of educational deficiencies. Problems involved in attempting to improve resource use in education are examined according to internal efficiency, external efficiency, and distributional equity. The document briefly examines some constraints and limitations to R&amp;D in education and suggests several strategies for overcoming them. In conclusion, the suggested program initiatives are summarized in terms of the educational goals they address. A 15-page bibliography is included.  (Author/DN)",

Administrative management activities for NIE are personnel, budget, finance, general services, contracts and grants, and overall administrative management. Management information is included in this list of activities, especially where the information or data are derived from administrative sources, such as the finance or personnel systems. In this report, administrative management activities are described in terms of (1) the policies governing NIE as a federal agency, (2) the management policies recommended for NIE, (3) the operational procedures recommended for NIE, and (4) the management and program decision process of NIE as an  agency. The report identifies documents and issuances that are to be developed for actual use by NIE as an agency, but which are not appropriate for inclusion in this report. Examples of such data are the document flow of personnel actions, travel orders, and contracts; a staffing pattern; the Common Accounting Number structure (CAN book) to be used for NIE accounting; and the allotment of funds (both program and administrative) for NIE operation during FY 1973. The objective of these administrative management measures is to provide an appropriate management structure for the NIE director and his managers to use as an instrument, effective July 1, 1972, to develop NIE into a fully operative agency; to fashion the FY 1973 program of R&amp;D funding; and to execute that program.

In presenting these strategies the authors first discuss some basic elements concerning organizational and managerial design and some of the most attractive combinations of these elements. Each of these combinations is called a strategy for the NIE. To add concreteness, each strategy is used to generate a fully detailed model of management procedure and organization for the NIE. The  models are not intended as blueprints for implementation in a sequence of formally outlined steps, but rather as concrete examplars of the alternative strategies proposed for organizing and managing educational R&amp;D.

        "description":"The reported project attempted to determine if formal inservice training improves the performance of paraprofessional aides in the classroom. Ninety-two teachers at four elementary schools examined the administrative, clerical, supervisory, instructional, and housekeeping duties most frequently performed by paraprofessionals and rated them on the effectiveness of their performance by responding to a questionnaire. The results indicate that paraprofessional aides who participate in a formal inservice training program and those who receive incidental on-the-job training basically perform the same kinds of duties, with their performance differing in frequency, variety, and competence. It was further revealed that formal inservice training programs place great emphasis on specific  duties, which tends to restrict the aide to tasks within the scope of that training; while incidental on-the-job training programs promote the performance of a greater variety of tasks. The investigation suggests that, to be practical and effective, inservice programs for paraprofessional aides should be designed at the local school level and should involve both the formal and the informal aspects of training.

Independent variables for data analysis consisted of the organized procedures for curriculum planning and implementation functions, the specific actions taken by teacher personnel in execution of the procedures, and leadership actions. The specific objectives of the investigation were to observe the effects of treatments on (1) general teacher attitudes, (2) attitudes of teachers toward  participation in a curriculum system, and (3) actual behaviors of teachers as participants in curriculum functions.

Sixty families, whose children had been attending school under the 45-15 plan for two years, were randomly surveyed. The primary conclusion of the interview survey was that parents perceive year-round education to have only a minor impact on the social, religious, economic, family life style, and health activities of their families. The majority of parents polled perceived changes in vacation plans, better education, and increased exuberance of children for school attendance as the greatest products of year-round education. Increased costs for recreational and vacation activities and school clothes, and the boredom of children during the 15-day period off were the  greatest negative results perceived.

An enrichment program, based on new experiences for the children and the acquisition of skills not regularly included in the elementary curriculum, was provided for 600 pupils in grades 1 through 6, utilizing the assistance of parent volunteers. The program, financed by a small appropriation from the local Parent Teachers Association, occupied one hour each day for five consecutive days. A total of 23 offerings were presented to the pupils who submitted first and second choices after consultation with parents. Techniques used in the program included multigrading and team teaching for the larger groups. The  program generated enthusiasm for school among pupils and parents, reduced absenteeism, and promoted communication among staff members previously reluctant to discuss classroom activities. The author states that the program could serve as a model for other elementary schools in need of generating enthusiasm within the school body or the community. (Photographs may reproduce poorly.)

Three assumptions were tested: (1) children will assume greater initiative in resource use, (2) teachers get to know the children better, and (3) team teaching in open space classrooms contributes to better academic success. For this study, two schools were selected that resemble each other in a number of variables to minimize effects from socioeconomic, racial, or ethnic differences; mobility of families; or length of membership in the community. Study data were collected through (1) a Child Study Security Test, administered to all subject children on two occasions; (2) a teacher rating questionnaire and a correlation matrix;  (3) scores on four subtests of the Canadian Test of Basic Skills; and (4) student I.Q. scores. The findings indicate, in part, that while a general improvement was shown in security, consistency, and independence scores for some students, each grade level in both schools showed a constancy or stability for each of the three security measures; the belief that students in open space classrooms increase in developing their feelings of self-confidence, work habits, and desire to work independently was not supported; teachers working in open space classrooms show some slight advantage over teachers in traditional classrooms in their ability to rate students in accordance with children's self description on a personality test; and that, based on tests of grade six students, students in  traditional classrooms do better academically.

A test program was conducted in temporary quarters with an experimental group of 25 randomly selected seventh grade students and a control group of 25 students from the regular junior high school building. The Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills, administered to both groups, showed no significant differences in cognitive achievement between the groups. An attitude test, drawn up by the teaching team and administered to the experimental group only, showed a high level of favorable student attitude. The teachers found both advantages and disadvantages in the open space arrangement, but  that the disadvantages were largely of a nature to respond to corrective measures. Those people involved in planning, implementing, and evaluating the open space program concluded that it warranted expansion into the new building, but that study of the concept should be continued, using additional methods of evaluation.

It offers suggestions for increasing the effectiveness of the process of international assistance. The author begins with a description of international educational development in the 1960's and then considers the educational needs of and the objectives for the 1970's. The publication documents the present flow of financial assistance by examining the assistance distribution and type and the aid administering agencies. Some of the problems and difficulties inherent in current educational assistance considered here include the fundamental questioning of the value of educational assistance, operational difficulties  faced by the aid agencies, and organizational problems in the aid chain. The author suggests strategies and criteria, as well as measures of redeployment, in the planning of educational assistance. The discussion concludes with a summary of all suggestions presented.

        "description":"This report describes a pilot program set up to test the feasibility of a student out-of-school tutoring service for 4th and 5th graders as a means of providing remedial instruction for potential dropouts. For testing purposes, a small-scale 5-session program was set up, using as tutors 9th through 12th grade volunteer students, from a local private school, participating on an after-school-hours basis. The program involved 10 tutors and 20 \"high-risk\" students. The tutoring service concentrated on the basic skills in English, reading, spelling, and mathematics for five consecutive Thursday evenings for one and one-half hours each. A tutoring design team developed the plans and format; and identified objectives, tasks, and evaluation strategies. The project was evaluated on both  the process and the product, and resulted from responses of tutors, and students and their parents to formal surveys. The results of the pilot program indicate that student volunteer out-of-school tutoring for high-risk students is feasible in terms of time, effort, and results; and that well-achieving high school students, if given proper direction, can be effective tutors for 4th and 5th grade students.

The desirability of a comprehensive volunteer plan was presented in a 10-point summary by an ad hoc committee, and a 17-member committee was charged with designing a volunteer aide program. The program was carried out in seven phases during the 1972-73 school year. Ninety-five types of activities that would be performed by aides were identified and further classified as resource or regularly scheduled activities. A full-time specialist was employed to coordinate recruitment, training, evaluation, and other elements of the program. As a result  of the program, the school system added 900 volunteers to its classroom personnel during a 15-month period. Performance and attitudinal evaluation indicated that the process and performance objectives of the program were successfully achieved. (Author)",

        "description":"During the 1966-67 school year, as part of its efforts towards decentralization, the Board of Education of New York City created an autonomous district located in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville area of Brooklyn. The newly formed local board experienced some difficulty in staffing the new district and eventually transferred 19 &quot;uncooperative&quot; teachers to the Central Board for reassignment. This summary action aroused the ire of the United Federation of Teachers and eventually led to a series of strikes in the fall of 1968. These strikes brought on a crisis in the educational life of the city. As the research and development arm of the U.S. Office of Education in New York region, the Center for Urban Education was tied to the school system through its programs in nearly 100 schools. By  nature of its contract, it was incumbent upon the Center to respond to the crisis. The Center's approach was established after numerous discussions and decisions arrived at by its Board of Trustees and its Management Group. These decisions are recorded in this report along with descriptions of six action projects engaged in by Center personnel. These projects were: (1) creative energy workshops in the arts; (2) television instruction; (3) training of parent-instructors; (4) workshops on post-strike problems; (5) descriptions by two superintendents of events during strikes in their districts; and (6) a survey of community attitudes in one district. Also included are reflections on the strike situation excerpted from the Center's leading publications. (Author/JF)",

A relatively simple and economical system of visually unmistakable signals was introduced so that decisions, especially at managerial levels in a large urban school system, would not have to be made in a vacuum -- that is, without clear indications of schools and grades where unusually high or low performances were being achieved. The introduction of the signals during the 1972-73 school year, with excellent cooperation by Atlanta school personnel, found in part that school  officials readily accepted the signals as an understandable mechanism that they could use to diagnose performance; personnel division staff used signals to improve procedures for screening new applicants; but that signals seemed to play little or no part in decisions regarding instructional programs and textbook adoption. One major implication of the findings for large urban school systems is that decisions concerning the operation of the school which are made higher up in the administrative structure are generally made without information regarding performance at the classroom level.

In particular, there is the need to understand how institutions and their clients relate to one another; how different patterns of formal and informal interaction affect the legitimacy accorded to these institutions by clients; and what the relationships between patterns of interaction and client-perceived legitimacy imply for the stability of these institutions. The School Attitudes Study is an effort to analyze these underlying forces and relationships in New York City's schools. The primary concern is determining the extent to which feelings of legitimacy are related to perceptions of effectiveness, responsiveness, and trust.  Additionally, the study probes into whether the processes that generate legitimacy vary in different school-community contexts (e.g., whether trust is the most salient determinant in some contexts, effectiveness in others, responsiveness in others, and particular combinations of these factors in still others.) The report first states the problem under investigation, then explains in some detail the procedures used, and finally reports preliminary impressions of trends and patterns in the data. (Author)",

The study investigated only public school districts in the United States in which a year-round feasibility study had been completed during the period 1963 through May 31, 1973. Findings indicate that the attitudes of teachers, administrators, parents, students, and the business community toward implementation of year-round schools is important in predicting whether or  not year-round programs will be put into operation. The author contends that no list of characteristics of school districts could be made that would be valid in predicting whether or not a district would implement year-round schools after a feasibility study.

        "description":"The year 1973 was marked by uncertainty and frustration regarding the federal role in education. The Congress and the President were deadlocked on key education issues. Administrative impoundment of funds and delays on appropriations forced State and local officials to struggle with day-to-day continuation of federal programs rather than focus on planning and implementing an integrated use of federal, State, and local programs and funds. Significant changes must be made in 1974 if the most effective use of federal resources is to occur. In this brochure, the Regents examine existing programs providing aid to elementary, secondary, and higher education and make recommendations on the educational issues now before this session of Congress.

        "description":"This paper provides an overview of selected simulation models pertinent to the problems of educational facility planning. Emphasis is placed on computer simulation models partly because of the greater potential utility of computer simulation models in coming to grips with facility planning problems. The overall objective is to document the state-of-the-art in simulation research as it relates to the planning of educational facilities and to help administrators and planners assess what simulation can and cannot do for them. The use of simulation models for school facilities planning has lagged far behind their use in other fields. This lag is no doubt a consequence of the current state-of-the-art in school facilities planning with its heavy emphasis on check lists and procedural  guidelines at the neglect of the model building approach. Consequently, it can reasonably be expected that as the field of educational facility planning becomes more systematic and scientific, the use of simulation models will increase. A selected bibliography of simulation works pertinent to the problems of educational facilities planning is provided in four parts: (1) general works, (2) university planning, (3) school planning, and (4) urban planning.

This section also contains reports on the involvement of students, parents, and the community in needs assessment and educational decisionmaking. The second section examines the tools available for decisionmaking, including that of information  systems.

        "description":"Montana, like other States throughout the nation, is trying to improve the quality and effectiveness of education. Currently, education in Montana is prescribed by State statutes and standards for school accreditation, which statutes and standards are also integral to school funding. The State Board, concurring with the Senate, concluded that since the statutes and accreditation standards fail to define adequately a basic quality education, &quot;interested persons and groups&quot; should be consulted for assistance in developing a definition and goals. The ideas generated by and from people in all of the meetings regarding a basic quality education indicate that the participants want schools to help students acquire basic skills and they also want schools to help students in their  personal development. Further, they see that the two must happen together, and that the school and the community share responsibility. These ideas, combined with others derived from the educational statements, provided a basis from which a definition of a basic quality education was formulated. The goal-setting process is based on the premise that if schools can determine what students should learn and can determine how they measure that learning, then questions of accountability can be more readily answered. The goals are therefore used to formulate measurable performance objectives for students at various grade levels. A selected bibliography by publication type and a list of the relevant publications of 24 States are included. (Author/WM)",

Results indicated that computerized scheduling saved both secretarial and teacher time, the majority of schools had smoothly operating timetables within the first two weeks of school, and class lists and textbook rental receipts were the most widely  used extensions of the computer scheduling system. Analysis of the course masters confirmed that the class size balancing was good. While no significant relationship between the number of simulate runs and the conflict rate could be found, it appeared that additional simulate runs were advantageous. Schools with extra simulate runs were, in general, operating smoothly earlier. (Author/WM)",

        "description":"The Parent Child Center Management Information System, the first operational MIS for a social action program relating to child welfare, consists of three interlocking components: a standard set of recordkeeping forms for the local Parent Child Center; a set of quarterly reporting forms that interface with the recordkeeping forms; and a series of management reports that can be produced from data that are reported on the quarterly reporting forms. The system links data reporting directly to management decisionmaking. It focuses, standardizes, and channels the flow of information needed for making rational decisions about funding, budgeting, program evaluation, contract compliance, and program planning; and the timing of the flow of this data is geared to cycles of important  management decisions. The system is seen as a potentially valuable means of maximizing the benefits from limited resources by timely reduction of managerial uncertainties. Additionally, it links costs to services, permits management to see how human resources are being used in a labor-intensive program, and acts as an early warning system and makes hard facts available for appropriate corrective action so that management-by-purpose can replace management-by-exception.

Next, it details the factors that affect city school finances, those to be considered in any significant school finance reform intending to aid urban school districts. The study examines what States have done in response to urban fiscal needs and presents an analysis of a suggested school finance reform measure, which can provide  more broadgauged fiscal equity -- particularly for urban schools. The document concludes with suggested general policies that could be followed by large city and other fiscally disadvantaged school districts to make the most of future reform opportunities.

The strategy is one that thinks of instructional changes as those that promise to make significant differences in instructional outcomes and then determines whether or not these changes fulfill their promises. The document cites evidence that supports the need for improvement in normal instruction, and then describes the author's strategy in three steps. The educational change strategist is enjoined to first define, classify, and schedule instructional objectives in terms of student performance; then analyze the performances to produce a specification of the demands they make on learners and to find analagous nonschool tasks that make these same demands (these tasks can also be used for  research purposes); and finally formulate and test hypotheses that identify the principal sources of variance in attaining mastery of these tasks. The author then considers two hypotheses about the principal sources of variance in attaining mastery of tasks and speculates as to what instruction might be like if research were to produce evidence of their viability.

        "description":"This study deals with the urban school system as a contracting agency which must negotiate with an organized group of employees who formerly were relatively powerless in presenting demands. The focus of the study is on the contracts drawn between the boards of education of New York City and Detroit with the respective teachers' unions in these cities following strikes in 1967-68. Part of the study deals with the impact of the contracts on teachers and principals in each city, and a search is made for some of the factors related to the climate for board-union negotiations in the two cities. A key finding of the study is that a qualitative difference in the climate for negotiations exists in the board-union relationship in each of the cities. Questionnaires completed by samples of  teachers, principals, and the union's building representatives were the major instruments used to get at the questions in this study. Information was also gathered from detailed examinations of the two contracts and interviews with selected spokesmen for the boards and unions in the two cities. (Author)",

The author begins by outlining criteria for organizational success. He then discusses two variables that have been found important in assessing readiness to profit from organizational development; i.e., readiness for collaboration and ready access to novel ideas or the \"variety pool.\" The author suggests that schools must adapt any organizational development strategy to meet local problems. Consequently, \"failure\" to adopt prepackaged innovation is often a successful use of resources in meeting a local problem. Systematic effort by a client does not always require \"success,\" but only that the school feel it has learned something and is likely to spend less effort than  before on working toward desirable outcomes. The author concludes by suggesting that the most \"innovative\" schools are not necessarily the most effective. (Author/DN)",

The guide, prepared by the Opelika (Alabama) schools, is said to be based on assumptions such as the values of structured individualized learning, use of materials which do not require reading ability, and development of feelings of competence. Noted is the belief that special education students can learn more in less time if provided with an appropriate curriculum. Major knowledge and skill groupings are presented as either a stimulus-response training sequence or as a continuum of sequential education units. It is stressed that the multi-level program provides for differences in learning pace through achievement of  objectives at six sequential plateaus. Briefly considered are a procedure for instructional placement, differences between training and education components, and meanings of terms such as percept, generalization, and competency. Provided for oral, pictorial, and written communication skills are 198 objectives. Approximately 450 arithmetic objectives are listed and coordinated with commercial programs for the subject areas of location and direction, measurement, time and motion, money concepts, numbers and grouping, fractions, and geometric forms. The 525 science objectives deal with concepts about the earth, plants, animals, people, and matter and energy.

Described is the delivery of mental health services to the SSSS, and identified are normative coping behaviors characteristic of the SSSS. Also discussed are test assessment of personality and intellectual factors and the  academic performance of SSSS school children. Other topics considered include the effects of prejudice and discrimination, cooperative and competitive behaviors, and the social and psychological implications of bilingualism. Among conclusions of the analytic review is the paucity of research on the mental health of the SSSS, the need for longitudinal and multidisciplinary research methods, the need for programs emphasizing prevention and rehabilitation, and the need for research which controls significant variables such as socioeconomic status.

It is stressed that a child in a low income family is more likely to be retarded than a child from a higher income family and that this interrelationship perpetuates a cycle of poverty. Previous experience is said to have taught that traditional enlistment approaches discourage participation in ARC programs by low income groups. Emphasized is the need to find out what low income residents desire in mental retardation programs. Provided are sociological facts and statistics from the federal poverty guidelines useful for persons dealing with low income families. Suggested are ways to contact families  through churches, schools, clinics, recreation areas, and social agencies. Contacts are seen to serve as bridges between local ARC chapters and the poor. Recommended are local ARC projects such as providing a service not previously available to demonstrate ARC effectiveness in dealing with problems of low income families. Suggestions for involving low income members in ARC chapters include helping meet transportation needs and simplifying parliamentary procedure at meetings. Encouraged is the participation of youth in ARC chapters. A major function of ARC is thought to be service as a catalyst to broaden existing services to the retarded. (DB)",

Topics covered in an overview of art study are criticism of student art, art as a synthesizer, awareness as a source of art, identification of roles, and development of expression through techniques such as keeping hands under a cloth while sculpturing. The function of art is examined in relation to the artist and the viewer, a system of symbols, forces of design, transformation of an encounter to a visual statement, and art as a process of abstraction, symbolism, unification, and awareness of self and  society. Approaches to the study of art are given to include elements such as line, artistic skills such as use of tools, presentation of art content such as varieties of textural experiences, and affective involvement such as study of Grecian art and philosophical concepts. Considered in a discussion of creativity and the study of art are cognitive synthesis, the process of transformation, abstraction and fluency, attributes of the gifted child, teaching methods that foster creativity, evaluation of art projects (a checklist is included), and development of human potential.

The recommendations given include provision for on-campus work training; opportunity for off-campus employment for students 16 years of age or older; employment placement based on readiness and need after assessment by the work-study coordinator, parents, and students; program development according to students' needs; and contact with students by a work-study coordinator who is both knowledgeable about special education and is given time for the coordinator role. Other suggestions are made such as scheduling for students to take part in extra curricular activities and regular class programs, organizing so that students can meet minimum requirements for graduation with a  high school diploma, and integrating the classroom and work training program within the total curriculum structure. It is maintained that the program should involve as many school personnel as possible, that students should be placed selectively, that a task force of community leaders should be empowered to make decisions, and that the importance of evaluation should be communicated to employers, students, and parents. Stressed is the necessity for compliance with the education code and labor laws at each governmental level. Advised are a work-hour arrangement based on factors such as type and degree of handicap, health, school and home schedules, and employer need; and student pay at the minimum wage for off campus productive employment, and by class credit for employment during school  hours. Emphasized is the crucial role of a professionally competent work-study coordinator in representing the school to the community. (MC)",

Two trainer consultants, five teachers, 15 interns in training as well as instructional aides and community volunteers participated. Equipment such as tape recorders and language masters were used. The program specified objectives such as appropriate grade level gains by identified handicapped children (HC) to equal or exceed gains of a control group. The HC were identified through diagnostic tests, and were evaluated daily by behavioral rating measures. Results indicated no differences between gains  of the HC and gains of the control group (students in another school receiving help in a resource room) for the first year, gains equal to gains of the control group during the second year, and gains equal to or greater than the total grade level group for grades 3, 5, and 6 in reading, and for grade 6 in mathematics during the third year.

The LTI is reported to have been set up as a result of an Office of Education (OE) report to Congress which recommended national LTI's. The first of the three planned LTI's is reported to have been attended by teams from 17 states, one region, and one foreign country. Listed are objectives  established for the LTI such as development and dissemination of appropriate publications and guidelines for the selection of participating states. It is explained that state teams consisted of the state education association's director of gifted and talented, a representative of a local education association, and two other interested individuals. Training sessions are said to have varied from large groups to small groups to independent study. It is noted that every participating state team developed a state plan while at the institute. Participants' evaluation of the LTI are reported to have been highly favorable. Among outcomes of the first LTI discussed are regular communication with OE and development of consultant services.

The study involved a literature review, interviews with special educators, visits to the two residential schools, visits to selected Ohio day programs, visits to selected out-of-state residential and day programs, and consultation with experts in the field. It was concluded that there is a need for both residential and day programs, that the day program has the potential for greater success with most handicapped students, and that the state needs to develop a comprehensive plan for educating the hearing and visually handicapped. The following were among recommendations reported: retention of  the residential schools for students who would be better served in a residential setting, elimination of residential placement due to the lack of a local day program, improvement of the quality of day programs, development of a state plan for educating Ohio's hearing and visually handicapped children, up-grading of cottage parents in residential schools, development of a research center at each of the two residential schools, assignment of day students to special short-term courses at the residential schools, and provision of preschool facilities for children and parents within a reasonable traveling distance of the handicapped child's home. Additionally suggested were areas for research such as the development of an effective cottage parent program and followup studies on blind and deaf  high school graduates. (DB)",

A systems approach used throughout the project analyzed inputs, processes, and effectiveness of the following demonstration goals: the four school systems' cooperation in providing a quality program, the 3R educational model (based on the Re-Ed model of N. Hobbs and the reality therapy model of W. Glasser), an inservice teacher training program, public school/university collaboration to train personnel, and project measurement by evaluative research. The organizational structure included a director with responsibilities such as  facilitating communication. Goals were evaluated in terms of effort, effect, adequacy, efficiency and process. Main findings showed that the cooperative strategy effectively reduced pupil costs (special unit cost per child of $1500 opposed to residential school cost of $9000) and fostered geater student academic compentence; that the educational program effectively improved 12 of 14 rated behaviors, fostered gains in IQ points, enabled 32 of 33 students to return to regular classes; that the teacher training program for over 700 teachers was adequate for cognitive understanding and inadequate for skill development/application; and that research was not conducted due to federal funding limitations.

The following were among effective project outcomes:  employing speech and hearing clinicians for diagnosis and remediation, conducting remediation classes in project schools so the Ss could remain in regular classes, providing workshops on auditory learning problems, and conducting inservice training for project teachers and clinicians. Findings from tests such as the Wepman Auditory Discrimination Test indicated comparable gains by experimentals in all schools. Findings from the demonstration class showed gains greater than regular first grade gains on tests such as the Metropolitan Readiness Test. Visitors wrote impressions of the project.

The recommended FY 1964 program is said to reflect an increase of about 75% of the total budget estimated for MR activities for FY 1963. It is noted that FY 1964 activities proposed are in accord with the President's special messages to the Congress and recommendations from the report of the President's Panel on Mental Retardation. Activities for 1963 are listed in terms of research and studies, professional preparation, services by government agencies, construction of facilities, and income maintenance such as public assistance payments to MR persons. Expanded and new  activities, authorized by legislation proposed for 1964, are described to include programs such as child welfare research and demonstration projects sponsored by the Children's Bureau, and research in learning processes sponsored by the Office of Education. Described to require enabling legislation are proposals for the following activities: comprehensive action to combat mental retardation; increased maternal, child health, and crippled children's services and research; maternity and infant care; construction of research centers for mental retardation and human development; construction of facilities for MR persons; Vocational Rehabilitation Act amendments for expanded rehabilitation of handicapped persons; education of special education teachers; and special projects to aid urban and  rural retarded children. Included is a financial summary of Department of Health, Education, and Welfare agency programs for the 2 years. (MC)",

Mental retardation is defined to be a condition characterized by faulty intellectual development which impairs learning ability and adaptation to societal demands. Discussed are aspects such as degrees of retardation, etiology, the problem's scope such as the percentage (3%) of retarded children born yearly, national concern expressed in efforts such as diagnostic services, and future trends based on factors such as longevity and changing patterns in U.S. family life. Summarized under the categories of research and studies, professional preparation, services,  and facilities and construction are mental retardation programs administered by the following organizational units of DHEW agencies: the National Institute of Mental Health, National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness, Center for Research in Child Health, and Bureau of State Services, and Bureau of Old-Age and Survivors Insurance of the Social Security Administration; the Office of Education; and the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation. Discussed are tasks of the President's Panel such as exploration of ways to prevent and cure mental retardation. Panel members are listed.

It is noted that undergraduates and the 16,500 clinicians with bachelors and masters degrees need a quality career education to meet needs of more than the 50% of children with communicative disorders now being served. Described is development of the alliance system in 29 regional workshops during 1971-1972 for school speech pathologists, audiologists, university personnel and state consultants. Noted is the role of the American Speech and Hearing Association  to assist school districts, universities, and state departments of education in establishing formal alliances. Discussed are participating groups such as school speech pathologists; purposes such as planning for school related research; the structure involving a coordinator; regional alliances comprising several universities and school districts; and organizational structure including a state alliance coordinating team. Listed are goals and objectives such as development of uniform procedures for evaluating children's progress in therapy. Noted are different kinds of alliances such as an interstate alliance located on a state border. Funding possibilities are given to include school districts' budgets for items such as education and research planning, local service groups, and private  foundations. Other aspects considered include evaluation through questionnaires, times for meetings such as after school, and periodic changes in objectives and procedures. (MC)",

(Those verbs which change their stem vowel from \"e\" to \"i\" do not fall into this category.) In a survey, 107 mostly young people from many locations were interviewed. There was an oral and written test of 14 verbs; results revealed that the use of the singular imperative (the \"Du\"-form, in the group of verbs used) follows the tendency to drop the suffix only to some extent and in differing degrees. Those verbs which change their stem vowel always show a zero ending in the imperative.  However, some verbs, particularly those with consonant clusters in their stems, adhere to the traditional rule for the singular imperative of infinitive stem plus \"e.\" Other verbs reflect the tendency toward omission of the suffix. Texts should be updated on the basis of the standard language as used by the educated German public. (Author/HW)",

The segmental phonetic units of human speech, according to this view, are supposed to convey linguistically relevant information, e.g., the vowel distinction that differentiates the English words \"bit\" and \"bet.\" Emotive, paralinguistic qualities are supposedly transmitted only by means of prosodic modifications like fundmental frequency, amplitude, and tempo as well gestures and facial expressions. Animals, according to this view, make use only of these \"paralinguistic\" parameters. This distinction is false. The same phonetic feature space is used for both  paralinguistic and linguistic communication, and the semantic boundary line between these two aspects of human communication is not sharp. The foundations of human language can be seen in the paralinguistic aspects of human communication and in the vocal and gestural aspects of the communications of other animals. (Author)",

Such an eclectic combination of the two theories is not new either in the field of general linguistics or in Vietnamese. This paper recognizes the hierarchical levels in syntax and the grammatical unit or tagmeme as composed of a slot and a filler class; it recognizes the case relations between various nouns and the predicative verb in the clause; and it also recognizes the centrality of the verb. Lexicase introduces both overt case realizations and covert case relations into the grammar as syntactic features assigned to nouns by verbs. The data presented here include: 12 covert case relations in Vietnamese; 11 overt case realizations; a  two-dimensional matrix yielding 25 possible combinations of covert case relations and overt case realizations (25 tagmemic slots); 14 verb groupings classed according to their hospitality to case-marked tagmemic slots; five clause types classed according to their identificational-contrastive features such as the nuclear tagmemic slots; 13 clause classes; and a bi-dimensional matrix of the clause types and the clause classes giving 64 possibilities or clause units, of which only 51 are grammatical in Vietnamese. The intention is to present the data rather than to defend the linguistic models used. (Author)",

Such rules as might be devised for specification of segment length would have to take into account, among other factors, the lenis/fortis nature of the segments at syllable margins, degree of stress, the relation between a given syllable and others in the same rhythm group, the same relations within the word, possibly the overall utterance length, and certainly the overall tempo. For the purpose of the piece of research under discussion recordings were taken of the first mode, stress-unstress, with the open front vowel /ae/. It was already known that duration figures for all segments would be different with various syllable nuclei and that they would vary systematically. The intention was to find out what relations existed between syllable  nuclei and syllable margins, what difference in terms of duration occurred when there was a falling pitch movement of the final stressed syllable, and what evidence was there for compensation withing the syllable and within the word. If it can be proved that major durational regularities exist in mathematical terms, then a description of broad classes of sounds, such as fortis stop consonants and peripheral/tense front vowels, in terms of standard duration, would have predictive value.

An automatic precedure for detecting constituent boundaries and maximum Fo positions in constituents, and sonorant energy and Fo functions, provided input data for an algorithm for locating stressed syllables. The first stressed syllable of a constituent was associated with a high-energy-integral portion near the rising Fo into maximum Fo position. Other stressed syllables were associated with high-energy-integral  portions near local increases in Fo above a steadily-falling \"archetype line\" from the maximum Fo position to the end of the constituent. For over 400 seconds of speech, including written texts, questions, commands, and declarations for man-machine interaction, over 85% of all syllables perceived as stressed by a panel of listeners were correctly located.

        "description":"Acoustical correlates of stress can only be evaluated in comparison with some \"standard\" specifying which syllables are actually stressed. The Standard should be consistent from time to time, and largely independent of talker and listener idiosyncrasies. Three phonetically-trained subjects listened to repeatedly spoken texts and spontaneous sentences until they could categorize each syllable as either stressed, unstressed, or reduced. This procedure was repeated three times for each speech text and listener. Two listeners differed from each other on only 5% of all syllables as to whether they were perceived as stressed or not. Each showed about 5% confusion in decisions about stressed syllables from one trial to another. Unstressed and reduced levels were confused more  frequently. The third listener gave less consistent results. Subjects' judgements of stress when given only the written text were of comparable consistency but did not correspond well with perceptions with speech, if the speech was spontaneous rather than spoken texts. Stress perceptions consequently may be suitable for evaluating acoustical correlates to within a 5% tolerance in overall location scores. Pooling the perceptions from several trials and several listeners may improve the stability of this \"standard\" for stress assignment. (Author/DD)",

        "description":"Automatic speech recognition is expected to be more successful when syntactically-related information is incorporated into early stages of recognition. Phonemic decisions, in particular, are expected to be more accurate and less ambiguous when contextual information is considered. A computer program detected about 90% of all boundaries between major syntactic constituents from fall-rise fundamental frequency (Fo) contours in the Rainbow Script as read by two talkers. A procedure was devised for locating stressed syllables, in constituents, from (1) high-energy and increasing-Fo portions near the peaks of Fo contours and (2) local increases in Fo from an archetype falling contour. The procedure succeeded in locating most syllables which had been perceived by listeners to be  stressed. A recognition strategy is outlined for using detected syntactic boundaries and stressed syllable locations in estimating distinctive features of some phonemes in connected speech. Vowel and consonanat recognition would be attempted first in the stressed syllables. Other readily-detected segments, such as coronal strident fricatives, would be found. A pilot study showed that front/back decisions for vowels are more reliable in stressed than unstressed syllables. (Author/DD)",

        "description":"At vowel onset following unvoiced consonants in /h-cvc/ utterances spoken by two talkers, Fo began high and fell about seven percent in the first five centiseconds. At closure of voiced oral obstruents, Fo suddenly dipped about ten percent, remained flat, suddenly rose about twenty five percent at opening of closure, and, after vowel onset, gradually rose. The high/low feature of the vowel, and manner and place of prevocalic consonant articulation had progressively less effects on vowel Fo values. The final consonant had no apparent effect on Fo values in the vowel. As previous synthesis work has suggested, the fall or rise of Fo in the initial portion of a vowel appears to be a cue to the state of voicing of previous consonants. Initial and peak Fo values in the vowel also can  indicate state of consonant voicing. However, Fo contours in bisyllabic words with contrasting stress patterns and similar phonemic sequences showed that: (1) an initially-falling Fo in a vowel may indicate either previous unvoiced consonant or an unstressed vowel, and (2) a rising Fo contour may indicate either a word-initial vowel, a preceding voiced consonant, or a stressed vowel.

Primary is the prediction that two or more grammatical devices may not apply to achieve antagonistic purposes in terms of theme-rheme distinctions. That is, no grammatical device may be used to indicate that an element of a sentence is the theme (or rheme) if another device has already been used to indicate the opposite. (Author/DD)",

Children employ substitutions and deletions in highly systematic ways; child pronunciations reflect a set of simplification strategies. The major common processes of both normal and abnormal child phonology result in simplification of either linguistic output or the underlying phonological system of the child. The processes include: (1) cluster simplification; (2) final consonant deletion; (3) assimilations of various sorts; and (4) processes of category collapse which include liquidation (liquids and glides become glides), voicing avoidance (final voiced consonants are collapsed with the unvoiced category), and stopping (initial fricatives, affricates, and stops become  stops). Even some processes which apparently result in complication of the child's output (viz., when the child adds phonetic elements to adult forms) are, in fact, simplifications since they reduce the child's speech effort by maximizing the production of certain preferred syllable shapes.

The preliminary results of a pilot study of rising intonations in French, in which average curves were obtained from spectrographic measurements of fundamental frequency, are also reported. In conclusion it is found that the preliminary set of average curves presented here lend support to Pierre Delattre's description of three of his ten basic intonations of French: Yes/No, major continuation, and implication. The method described for deriving these average curves from spectrographic measurements is seen as a sound one, promising worthwhile results in future studies. Finally, in a discussion of the  results of Allan Grundstrom's experiment with synthetic speech, it is noted that they seem to confirm the assumption that fundamental frequency is an effective cue for the perception of intonational distinctions. Perception testing of synthetic intonations is emphasized as a fruitful technique for acoustic description, which will eventually provide an adequate acoustic description of the distinctive intonation contour for Yes/No questions in French.

The objective of the study was to conduct an accurate inventory, by specialty, of physicians in active practice in Florida and to identify gaps in the supply and distribution of physicians. The inventory was compared first with the physician staffing patterns of several major group health plans, ratios that have frequently been used for comparison with the number of practitioners in certain populations. This comparison developed an &quot;excess&quot; of physicians in primary care and in most specialities for the  state. Such a finding is markedly inconsistent with the availability of physicians that actually pertains in Florida today. Under the conclusion that the group health plan ratios do not apply to the system by which health care and physicians' services are delivered to Floridians at this time, the author of this report has developed a set of recommended baseline physician ratios and has compared the inventory with those.

Students in a liberal arts college rated faculty on two typical teaching evaluation instruments and on a semantic differential form. Data came from 1,500 student judgments on 108 faculty (86 percent). Factor analysis, analysis of variance, and multiple regression analyses showed that (a) personality and teaching effectiveness were highly correlated (.77), (b) factors derived from the semantic differential predicted a multiple R= 0.88 for teaching effectiveness, and (c) dynamic, pragmatic, amicable, and highly intellectually competent faculty received statistically significantly higher teaching competence ratings than did professors tending toward  the opposites of these traits. The findings suggest that improvement of teaching effectiveness may depend more on changes related to personality factors than on those involving classroom procedures. (Author)",

This document describes one course of action illustrated by current efforts to increase the supply of health personnel by a shortened curriculum in professional schools. Usually these programs offer only about 3 months less coursework than traditional programs but, by foregoing summer vacations, students can graduate in 3 years. Maldistribution, or the fact that physicians and other health personnel tend to congregate in urbanized areas and to avoid rural ones, is also a major factor in the delivery of dental care. The problem in nursing is the attrition rate, one of the highest of all professions. Given the expense of educating health personnel, the  future of American health care appears to lie not in increasing numbers, but in a change in the working patterns of health personnel, patterns related to patient care and to others of the health care team. Preventive, comprehensive care; expanded roles for nurses and utilization of auxiliary personnel; and a team approach to health care--all applied within community settings--spell the future of American health care delivery, and the foci of many Southern curricula presented in this report.

Higher education is crowded with tasks solely within the competence of the individual college or university such as equal access for all ages, improved career training, and curriculum development. Instead of lamenting the lack of governance on campus, higher education should become involved in what can actually be done on campus. (PG)",

Incorporating several design features not found in previous studies on this method, it was found that all of the basic elements of the Keller method contribute significantly to its overall effectiveness in learning (course exam) and in retention (3-month follow-up) of material. These results are consistent with others that recommend this approach as a promising method of instruction, particularly at the undergraduate level. (Author)",

        "description":"A personalized system of instruction (PSI) was used to teach an undergraduate course in the principles and procedures of behavior modification. In most courses utilizing PSI, proctors grade quizzes and discuss the incorrect answers with the students. This study investigated the effect these discussions had on the students' quiz performance. The results indicated that the discussions produced only slightly higher scores on initial attempts at quizzes. However, students had to retake only 3% of their quizzes when they experienced discussion, whereas they had to retake 18% of their quizzes when they had no discussions. In addition, students answered questions concerning the general application of the principles and procedures of behavior modification both before and after taking the  course. Their answers were then compared with the answers of a group of students who did not take the course. This comparison was made in order to see if a PSI course would produce a more general verbal repertoire than that which the course specifically required. The PSI students' answers to the general questions improved relative to their initial answers, whereas to other students' answers did not improve. (Author)",

At Empire State College, the learning contract is a term used to imply a solid commitment to a plan of study developed by a student and a faculty member after whatever deliberation both deem necessary. The learning contract specifies the learning activities to be undertaken, the duration of the study, the criteria by which the work is to be evaluated, and the amount of credit to be assigned. The learning contract addressed itself to various dimensions of learning: the long range plan(s) of the student, specific purposes or topics, the learning activities to be undertaken and the means and criteria of evaluation. The student should clearly state his or her long-range  plans, aspirations, or goals. These interests provide a conceptual framework around which a sound degree program is developed. Thus, each contract should relate to the degree program and should be an avenue leading toward the attainment of a degree. This guide presents the framework and the problems inherent in writing a learning contract. (Author/PG)",

Four general strategies are outlined in the paper that are intended to: (1) yield information directly applicable to policy issues and decisions; (2) yield information in a timely fashion; and (3) be implementable, in the sense of practical feasibility. The four plans briefly outlined, are the following: (1) Senior Assessment; intellectual competence focuses on the development of a number of intellectual and academic attributes while taking into account the general academic  ability of the student at the time he enters as a freshman. (2) Sophomore Assessment: intellectual and/or vocational: affords a method for evaluating institutional effectiveness in either general education or vocational training programs during the first two postsecondary years. (3) Cross-sectional: intellectual and nonintellectual, generated by all the information yielded by 1 and 2 as well as intellectual criteria. (4) Alumni survey permits taking freshman ability into account in assessing postgraduate achievement. (Author/PG)",

Students were asked to describe their reactions to the University experience, attitudes and opinions about the University, involvement in University life, and attitudes toward faculty and course work. They saw the functions of a university as fostering personal development of students, providing academic experiences, service to community and society, and vocational preparation. They regarded the University atmosphere as liberal, academically competitive, and conducive to their maturing. Most of these students reported some out-of-class contacts with faculty and said that such student-faculty  relationships enhanced learning by making it less impersonal. In looking back over their four years, a majority reported that academic experiences were a source of satisfaction, that their personal development was the most valuable of their experiences, and that interpersonal relationships were the most meaningful of their experiences. Their most frequent advice to a high school senior was, &quot;Go to college.&quot; (Author)",

This report is concerned with the transfer student's capability to succeed at the new institution. In encouraging flexible movement of students among institutions, one must find equitable ways to maintain standards. The grade-point average is too much of a differential to be the only factor in deciding a student's ability to transfer. The emphasis of this paper is on the fact that there are different ways to approach the problem of transfer standards and that various mechanisms may be appropriate for various institutions and for different types of transfer students. Four general mechanisms are described to monitor the movement of transfer students in ways that  are reasonable from the standpoint of the student, the institution, and the public. They are: adjusted grade, standardized examinations, competency standards, and accreditation. The author then articulates the varieties of transfer: articulated vertical transfer, traditional horizontal transfer, nontraditional transfer, reverse transfer, open-door transfer, double reverse transfer, and vocational transfer. The conclusion suggests the need for exemplary program models concerning transfer students. (Author/PG)",

This has been an activity of man since his earliest days, when primitive man first classified animals and plants in the interest of food. Philosophers, including Aristotle and Roger Bacon, have always been concerned with the arrangement, not only of objects, but of knowledge, into definable catagories. Library classification--practical systems for the arrangement of books on shelves--has also existed since ancient times. Librarians have relied, in their arrangements, on the knowledge schemes created by philosophers. As knowledge, and the number of books, have increased, new library  schemes have been developed. The 19th Century saw many such schemes, notably the Dewey system. Because of the dynamic nature of knowledge itself, library classification schemes are unlikely ever to be stabilized. At present, librarians are attempting to fill the gaps by creating special systems for individual subjects such as business and medicine. (SL)",

        "description":"The state of the art of the educational publishing industry is reviewed. The points are made that the industry is highly competitive and diversified and that sales of all media amount to $1.2 billion annually. Publishers are defined as individuals who assist in the communication of ideas and whose functions include the creation, editing, production distribution, serving and financing of materials. Diversity is insured by the large number of companies in the field, but this fragmentation also prevents basic research on a large scale. Publishers cannot yet be held accountable for the success of their materials because control over the selection and assignment of materials is held by state and local committees and control over their use remains in the teachers' hands. Thus, market  penetration and profitability are the best available criteria of success. Publishers do conduct a limited amount of pilot testing and in-service teacher training and the Association of American Publishers stands ready to cooperate with the National Institute of Education (NIE) in programmatic, problem-solving projects. These efforts, in conjunction with NIE's basic research, will help to promote more effective education. (Author/PB)",

Since the National Institute of Education (NIE) will be judged in terms of the degree to which educational practice is improved, it must assume responsibility for the implementation of new findings. Thus, NIE must conduct a three-pronged operation. First, it must analyze and remain sensitive to user needs, without becoming captive to the users' immediate desires at the cost of abandoning long-range basic research. Second, NIE must continue its research and development activities. Finally, the Institute must oversee the dissemination and utilization of the products of its research. This will require research on strategies for effecting the diffusion and  implementation of new ideas, cooperating with other educational agencies, and extra funding for these post-research and development activities. It appears that the best way to insure the smooth development of innovations from need analysis to implementation is to make the same group responsible for an entire project from inception to completion. This will require the integration of both personnel and functions to a greater degree than has previously existed. (PB)",

The National Institute of Education (NIE) has adopted the last posture, whereby the agency advocates a strategy of implementing change by sponsoring a sequence of activities including need and capability assessments, trial of alternatives, evaluation and implementation. Within this context, NIE's dissemination and utilization efforts involve a knowledge production sector, multiple communication channels and a knowledge using system. Trends influencing dissemination include the growth of education as a community-wide lifelong concern, decentralization, and the increase of educational conflicts. If educators are to be free to choose among alternatives, NIE's dissemination efforts must  recognize that dissemination dynamics are generalizable across settings, that the lasting effect of change is upon people, not things, and that adaptive behavior is more common than adoptive behavior. It is recommended that NIE: 1) support change processes, not products; 2) stress need and capability assessments and long-range planning; 3) attend to the implementation procedures which intervene between dissemination and utilization; 4) promote cooperation among agencies; 5) adopt new communication technologies; and 6) conduct research on the dissemination and utilization of innovations.

Needs were surveyed, interviews conducted and literature reviewed. Following this, 33 objectives were identified and the book, &quot;ITV: Promise Into Practice,&quot; was written and evaluated by three judges and a random sample of Ohio educators. Analysis of the data showed that 30 of the objectives were attained. Readers judged that the book provided the  needed background for making rational curriculum decisions relevant to ITV.

This, in turn, requires the building of testable theoretical models and the formulation of strategic propositions to test their validity. An example of the process involved is as follows. Focusing upon the domain of what people learn at the cognitive and affective levels from participating in a simulation game with a discussion component, one can identify the four major attributes of: individuals, group participation, simulation game-with-discussion, and learning outcomes. Specific variables within each of these attributes can be identified and laws of interaction devised, such as that learning variables are dependent upon  game-with-discussion variables. Strategic propositions are thus generated; e.g., that participants in game-with-discussion demonstrate higher cognitive learning outcomes than participants in games-without-discussions. Specific hypotheses can then be devised and tested; for example, that subjects experiencing games-with-discussion will score higher on an immediate true-false posttest of knowledge of the game, than will subjects who experienced the game without discussion.

Second, the Board denies the accusation that the State Education Department's programs are of poor technical quality and weak in content, and offers evidence to the contrary. Thirdly, the charge that the SED's supervision of local station operations has been minimal is countered with evidence which indicates that the Department has operated to the limits of its actual  authority and resources.

Comparative functional profiles of each unit were first developed and revised to constitute a consensus self-portrait. Next, data on the research utilization networks of two of the units were obtained from questionnaires. Subsequently, two interface conferences were convened involving sub-samples of those surveyed in the network study. A theoretical model was then developed to describe a resource-user problem-solving dialogue within which it was possible to analyze all functions and activities of diffusion and utilization agencies. Communication network maps were drawn to depict the types and flow of information.  Major findings were that: 1) research information was rarely sought in crises; 2) attitudes toward dissemination and utilization were dominated by ideologies termed &quot;linkage&quot;, &quot;user-centering,&quot;&quot;Research Development&quot; and &quot;capacity&quot;; and 3) the most important elements in the dissemination and utilization system which needed improvement were a) linkage, b) diagnosis of user needs, and c) planning and organization of the overall dissemination and utilization system.

A predictive test battery which consisted primarily of content-related tests and mini-lessons that were directly associated with a training course, proved to be better than general aptitude measures for predicting course completion time; a strong linear relationship was found between predictors and completion time criteria. Step-wise linear regression analyses were used to  develop predictive functions and to determine potentially useful predictors. Computer programs and nomographs were constructed to display the predictive equations and were recommended for use. Since there were significant inter-group differences in learning rates depending on the media used, the development of media-specific predictive equations was recommended. (Author/PB)",

The main purposes of the simulation are: 1) to introduce, as attributes for individualizing instruction, information processing variables with their associated reinforcement contingencies; 2) to model the learning environment resulting from the adaptation of instruction based on such attributes; and 3) to specify a computer-based adaptive instructional model which selects treatments dimensioned on the attributes of information processing variables and which provides for the control and monitoring of learning. The simulation is part of an overall effort to apply the  results of psychological research to educational needs. Phase one of this effort simulates a learning environment based on knowledge gathered from 1) cognitive psychology and 2) from the experimental analysis of behavior. The second stage will involve a review of the relationship of these two areas and of individual differences useful in adaptive instruction, while the final phase will attempt an empirical evaluation of the simulation.

Theories range from punitive to religious, humanitarian, educational and legalistic. The therapeutic theory of library access for inmates would further advance library service, but it is as yet unaccepted. The history of prison libraries up to 1950 shows that the punitive, religious, humanitarian and educational theories variously held sway. In the late 1950's and early 1960's, although some encouraging events took place, only three successful library programs were reported; all other projects were in the form of surveys, speeches and plans. More recently, the prison law library has become a hot issue, and it has  introduced a new basis for library access to inmates--that of legal right. The basis of library service to prisoners should be changed from legal necessity to rehabilitation. One must refer to the literature of bibliotherapy to find an explanation of how books can be therapeutic and to find suggestions of programs and methods. There are significant projects for correctional institutions that demonstrate that bibliotherapy is one means to a truly rehabilitative phase of correctional library theory. (JB)",

The question of whether or not they should function as propaganda arms or information centers still remains a polemical issue. The USIA became an independent agency of the executive branch of government in 1953. Since then, the number of U.S. Information centers has grown to its present level of 133. Each Center tailors its programs to meet the special needs of its own community. Generally, the Information Center Service maintains four types of programs: 1) libraries or cultural centers for the study of the U.S.; 2) a commercial book program to place more American-written books in bookstores and  classrooms; 3) teaching English; and 4) exhibits of American achievement. Moreover, the Centers assist the Informational Media Guaranty Program and Binational Centers around the world. Since 1961, a policy has been made to withdraw funds from Western Europe and to use them in the developing nations. Funds are appropriated each year by Congress. The future of USIS libraries is as uncertain as ever-changing world politics, the availability of funds, and the predispositions of the current administration. (CH)",

Results showed that subjects receiving the easy-to-hard sequence did significantly better on the performance test than did those receiving the hard-to-easy sequence. Also, the memory support treatment groups had significantly fewer errors on the performance test than did the nonmemory support groups. The instructional condition of easy-to-hard sequence plus memory support was the optimal treatment and provided manipulatable variables for  applied usage. (Author)",

Between July 1970 and June 1972, four nonprofessional library representatives made monthly visits to homes, to provide books, to stimulate interest in the library, and to discover local needs. The representatives completed a six-week training course in library services and collections and in visitor techniques. Using the social work caseload approach, each visitor was assigned about 250 families, who had agreed to participate in the Project. The target families represented a socio-economic cross-section of the community, and included both library users and non-users. Toward the end of the project, a  questionnaire was distributed to the patron families. It was found that the personal caseload service often stimulated interest in reading, but not necessarily in library use. A need for library service was established for a previously unserved group--the &quot;functionally homebound&quot; who, while not handicapped, are kept from the library by lack of transportation or family responsibilities. But the caseload approach proved to be a prohibitively expensive technique for library extension. (SL)",

The major findings were that non-resident use of reference services ranged from 1.4 to 49.1%, that students and teachers comprise 50.8% of the reference clientele, that in-person reference use was 76% and telephone inquiries 23% of the total and that Monday afternoon was  the busiest time of the week. The majority of inquiries were subject searches and ready reference questions with the most popular areas being history and biography. The card catalog and the non-fiction circulating collection were found to be the most heavily used materials.

A scenario technique based on Delphi surveys is used to predict automation in the knowledge transfer process. The morphology of the growth of information is examined, and a general diagnosis and recommendations are offered. In the author's opinion, the problems of information transfer have been largely underestimated. He predicts a great technological innovation and revolutionary change from 1980-90 will have a  profound impact on society and insists upon an immediate effort to set objectives and priorities. He recommends and provides guidelines for setting up international machinery for monitoring and assessment and an Institute for Information Science and Technology for training purposes.

        "description":"An overview of relevant literature reveals that residents in urban areas apparently have a multitude of nonoccupational information needs which are not being satisfied within the constraints of existing information resources and systems. A conceptual framework was drawn, focusing on four basic components--urban residents, their needs, sources of information, and solutions--and linkages or interactions among them. The Baltimore Urbanized Area was chosen for the investigation, and extensive exploratory work was undertaken towards the end of obtaining data. A survey instrument was developed and pre-tested, then was utilized in gathering data from a cross-sectional random sample of residents. The great quantity of data elicited were analyzed in terms of information needs,  information-seeking strategies (behavior), and search outcomes. In a final exploratory testing phase an attempt was made to develop a methodology for assessing the capability of library and information agencies to deal with the problems/questions identified by residents in the earlier survey phase.

The main objectives were to determine 1) if, after having received CAI, the dental student could determine whether a patient had a clinical need for space management and 2) if the dental student's attitude toward CAI and space management remained favorable. Senior dental students and dentists already in practice took cognitive and affective pretests and then received the CAI product in which pediatric space management cases were presented via various media. A typewriter terminal connected to an IBM 360/50 computer provided control of the instructional sequence and immediate corrective feedback to the subjects' typewritten diagnoses. The computer program was written  in the PILOT author language. Posttest results indicated that both objectives were successfully achieved, for the subjects met the minimal standards for diagnosis and their attitudes remained as positive as they were at the beginning of the project.

        "description":"A research study investigated the effects on student performance and attitude of three different strategies for selecting lessons in a course in computer programing presented by computer. Sixty college students were randomly assigned to the strategies of student selection of lessons, program selection in the light of the student's past performance, and forced selection independent of the student's history. Several aptitude, performance, and attitude measures were applied, and no significant inter-group differences were found. These findings run counter to the common belief that students who control their course of study perform better and have more positive attitudes. The possibility exists that the particular computer programing course used in the experiment, since it was  essentially linear in nature, did not lend itself to student control and that this tended to obscure differences which otherwise would have been manifested. To test this hypothesis, an additional experiment involving a nonlinear instructional-experimental environment is being planned. (Author/PB)",

The agenda included the following topics: 1) copyright models; 2) copyright policies; 3) effective use of materials; 4) educating users; 5) developers as distributors; 6) distributors as developers; 7) special products; 8) clearinghouse functions; 9) evaluation, review, and revision; and 10) royalties. The conference report first presents a conceptual framework for  the related tasks of research, development, evaluation, demonstration, distribution, and implementation and then articulates seven principles upon which dissemination and copyright policy can be based. A total of 63 applications based on these principles and designed to produce more effective widespread use of NIE-sponsored products concludes the report. (PB)",

In Pennsylvania, as in other states, there is a need for a systematic approach to coordinating CATV with other educational resources. The Pennsylvania Department of Education can promote the more effective use of cable by: 1) identifying the educational needs which can be served by CATV; 2) maintaining current information on available cable facilities; 3) designing a plan to provide cable channels to education; 4) encouraging the development of educational programing; 5) providing evaluation services for cable-related activities; and 6) fostering research on new uses of CATV. Cable's technology is powerful and its potential great, but  educators must begin to make use of this promise or cable's channels will be given over to other purposes. In order to actualize this potential, educators will have to develop subject matter programs, have their schools wired for cable, explore cost-sharing and facility-sharing options, and confine their requests to realistic programs.

Seventy-one behavioral objectives were identified and videotapes and worksheets prepared for each; mini-tests were given after each lesson and a final exam administered at the conclusion of the course. Students checked the skills required in each lesson and then elected either immediately to &quot;test out&quot; of the objective or to seek instruction before testing; this latter alternative involved the options of studying worksheets, viewing videotapes, or interacting with tutors or the instructor. SCIMP was regarded as successful; completion rates were 50% higher than in traditional courses, learning was 11% to 18%  higher. There was more efficient use of teacher time and students enjoyed the course. Since all students had to acquire to criterion each of the same skills and concepts, there was homogeneity of output; the feedback provided by the mini-tests led to early diagnosis and remediation of problems and frequent testing also aided retention. Finally, the modular organization of the course also facilitated both student grasp of specific concepts and easy modification of the instructional program. (PB)",

The project borrowed its major ideas from television news cinematography, shooting only color film with single system optical sound equipment. The basic production steps of preparing scripts, shooting and processing originals, editing, making release prints, and distributing copies were followed. Short single concept films were shot on location to educate and entertain villagers and to demonstrate  improved agricultural methods. The project was successful, for costs were kept to less than $27 a minute (excluding labor), the films were shown to one-third of the country's population each year, and a Malawian staff took over the operation of the film unit after 18 months.

        "description":"The Institute on the Automation of Bibliographical Services was held at the University of Maryland, 10-21 June 1968, conducted by the School of Library and Information Services, assisted by the Library of Congress Information Systems Office and the University Computer Science Center. Thirty-nine participants from academic, special, and public library systems attended and were taught by a staff drawn from the University faculty and from libraries cooperating in the MARC experiment. The Institute program consisted of lectures, seminar discussion and practical exercises in two laboratory sessions; one on the preparation of bibliographic data for input into the computer, demonstrating the conversion of information to paper tape; the other on computer manipulation of MARC tapes for  various purposes. Participants in the Institute stated that exposure to the first hand detail and experience of the MARC experiment had given them a very real understanding of the problems and processes of library automation. Many were confirmed in the acceptance of the Library of Congress tapes as a basis for future operation. (Institute materials are presented in the appendixes.) (Author/SL)",

        "description":"To prepare for an increased interest in Black Studies, Afro-American Culture, and materials about the disadvantaged, the Institute on the Selection, Organization and Use of Materials By and About the Negro conducted a concentrated six-week program for 26 academic librarians. The main objective was to prepare the participants to select, organize and disseminate materials on the Negro and to coordinate the services of the library with the requirements of new curricular and research programs at the area. A highly qualified staff of lecturers dealt with four specific topics: 1) selection and utilization of Negro resource materials; 2) organization and preservation of special collection materials; 3) bibliography of the Negro; and 4) administration of Negro collections. Field trips,  readings, and interdisciplinary seminars were provided. The evaluations of the participants and staff showed that the institute accomplished its purpose. However, two major weaknesses were found; the programs were too full, allowing insufficient time for reading and individual projects; the interdisciplinary approach made some participants less interested in the lecture topics. (Appended are lists of participants, a proposal for a publication of the Association of African-American Bibliography, and handbook for the Organization of Black Materials. (Author)",

Since data centers which codify and evaluate physical properties need to use this conventional symbolism, it is recommended that they adopt the symbols and terminology specified by the various International Unions, both for manual operations and for the creation of machine-readable data bases. It is demonstrated that these conventional symbols can be produced by communications devices which are compatible with the international standard codes for information exchange. A set of characters suitable for representing scientific data and text is presented and proposed as an extension of the International Organization for Standardization(ISO)  information interchange code. The use of this extended character code by computer oriented data centers at the National Bureau of Standards is described. In addition, the kinds of equipment needed for this level of performance and criteria for their selection are outlined. (Author)",

The study examined the developmental steps which preceded the production of Sesame Street by Children's Television Workshop, of the Chicago TV College, of Telekolleg of Germany, and of the Advocates; the aim was to identify developmental models to be used in connection with the creation of a new career education program aimed at women in the home and sponsored by the United States Office of Education. The first section of the report describes a general model of program development which includes the common phases of planning, development, operations and evaluation. Following this, summary case studies of the four individual programs are provided. The conclusion is reached that if a  program can be based upon an existing organization, if it requires neither extensive research nor complex programing, and if objectives, target audience and methods are known in advance, then an effective television-based educational program can be developed in a short time. If these conditions aren't present then the developmental phase will be long and costly. (PB)",

The objective was to impart an understanding of language and communication and enough command of scientific method and skills to mitigate the alienation from science found in so many students. The impact of the course on student attitudes toward science is examined, and the selection of course content, instructional methodology and grading patterns are discussed. Software and hardware used in the course are analyzed and a review is made of the problems involved in moving from  experimental services to routine institutionalization. Attention is called to the needs to: 1) develop accounting procedures capable of projecting and comparing costs; 2) provide a better managerial structure for experiments; and 3) develop procedures which permit the handling of longitudinal data.

Successful simulations of the Drill and Practice Model, the Pacing Model and the Monitoring Model were accomplished and operational feasibility was demonstrated. In addition, a User's Guide was prepared and a single integrated technical package developed to describe how the models operate. It was recommended that simulations of at least two additional models--Concept Acquisition and Dynamic Programing--be made and that empirical validation of model  effectiveness be conducted employing actual students in real time. Such research would allow the comparison of alternative instructional strategies, assess student attitudes toward computerized instruction, and provide a means of gaining experience in the optimization of instructional strategies prior to widespread Air Force implementation.

The GERIS program, which combines an eight-step process in language skill development with student-created television productions, was used at two schools during the 1972-73 school year. One hundred seventy-two students in grades 4 through 6 and 7 through 9, each of whom was reading at least two years below grade level, were included in the program. Post-test results from the Stanford Achievement Test indicated that students in grades 4 through 6 showed significant improvement in reading for the first time in their school careers; their achievement in both word meaning and paragraph meaning was double that which otherwise would have  been expected. An improvement in achievement significant at the .05 level was not found for students in grades 7 through 9, although the seventh graders did show over a year's growth and did achieve at a rate well over twice that of their previous performance in traditional reading programs. It was concluded that GERIS can effect dramatic improvements in reading among problem readers at the lower grade levels. (Author/PB)",

Five hour-long television programs were broadcast, each of which presented alternatives for the use of a simulated parcel of Maine land. Viewer and leader guides and a land use game were supplied at no cost to viewers who requested them and after each program viewers voted on alternative uses of land via toll-free phone lines. Post-program survey results indicated that viewers of the simulation programs; 1) became better  informed about land use issues; 2) developed an appreciation for the complexity of environmental problems 3) began to debate more actively about land use; and 4) had positive feelings about the worth of the simulation.

The advent of simple, portable video equipment has made it possible for schools to create programing which is age-specific (for seven to 12 year-olds) and directed at the usually neglected urban, non-middle class child. Elementary classes produced eight programs in a year, each of which was broadcast on local cable television. Analysis of the project's results indicated that the creation and cablecast of television programs by children successfully addressed several educational problems since these experiences: 1) transformed a one-way medium into an interactive one; 2) gave individual children an opportunity to pursue  interests and voice their opinions; 3) helped children with histories of failure and poor self-esteem to contribute meaningfully to group activities; and 4) allowed children to learn in alternative ways. In addition, the equipment's simplicity permitted hands-on technical experience and allowed children to take it into the community for on-site contact with the non-school world. (PB)",

Dissemination and adoption are subject to a number of factors, which can be further detailed. Previously innovation was seen as a one-way flow from producer to consumer, but a deeper understanding of the process shows the influence of consumer feedback and participation in product development. Paper Two reviews the growth of educational dissemination systems which were generated by educational research and development (R&amp;D). The atmosphere of the postwar &quot;Big Science&quot; knowledge explosion and the pressure put on American education by the launching of Sputnik  brought about the ERIC (Educational Resources Information Center) which was modeled on the new scientific information systems. This strictly archival system proved inadequate, another formal communication method was added--a series of reports on current topics. However informal communications are also needed, in the form of &quot;extension agents&quot; who can mediate between ERIC and users in the field. Such a system, whether implemented nationally or locally, would make ERIC more accessible. (SL)",

These were divided into competencies which, in turn, were further broken down into behavioral objectives. The major program areas were identified as: instructional design; evaluation and selection; integration; utilization and dissemination; media design and production; administration and implementation; data processing; reference; instruction; and research and development. Standardized terms were specified and the Model of Mastery  was adopted to assist in the development, implementation, and evaluation of instructional materials and programs. This Model allows instructors to evaluate alternative approaches by specifying stimuli, student responses, products of responses, effectiveness, cost and difficulty. Instructional modules based on this approach have been field-tested and the initial results are highly favorable. As a result, additional modules in the area of design and production of media, integration, utilization and dissemination are being prepared. (PB)",

        "description":"Research investigated computer simulations of a hypothetical self-paced training program to determine the utility of this technique as a planning aid for Army training program managers. The General Purpose Simulation System (GPSS) was selected as the programing language and the study was divided into three stages. In Stage I, the daily number of entering and graduating students was computed and displayed in a printout. In Stage II, statistics were added to deal with attrition rates, advanced training schedule comparisons, training load, and completion times. In the last phase, the final simulation program made possible the determination of the most efficient follow-on course location of each student, the medium of instruction assigned to each student, the session attended by the  student, the absentee rate, and additional summary data on student flow through the course. It was concluded that the simulations were useful planning tools, for they allowed training managers to offer advanced courses on a schedule consistent with student flow through basic courses, thus reducing the student's waiting time between courses. The use of the simulations was recommended in planning training programs. (Author/PB)",

During July 1970-June 1971, a total of 477 bibliotherapy sessions have been held with an average attendance of 12 patients. Feedback from the bibliotherapist, as well as from the patients, has aided the ward teams in evaluating and planning ongoing treatment. The program has resulted in an increase in attention span, self-disclosure, emotional stability, and many other positive effects. In addition to its therapeutic value to the patients, the bibliotherapy program has  provided a training experience to social work students in field training at Agnews over the past years. (CH)",

Most patients were returned to the community, where the County would provide the services formerly provided by the state. The new setting was different from the hospital situation; there was a wide variety in the type of the clientele and facility served. The use of a greater variety of materials, more frequent coordinating efforts, and a prolonged contact with the same clientele were necessary measures to readjust the program to the changed conditions. The emotionally disturbed patients in the community were located through the various agencies and assisted  through the use of various library materials and discussion groups. The success of the program was reflected not only by the response of the clientele but also by the support of the community to continue the program under County Revenue Sharing Funds. (CH)",

Tape recordings of dialogues between tutors and students about South American geography were made to discover the strategies used by tutors. Since SCHOLAR is a well-defined program, it was possible to analyze the naturalistic data in precise terms. Individual aspects of the dialogues were analyzed separately and, based upon the analyses, several hypotheses were prepared which described how the tutor related his teaching to the individual student. These strategies were implemented in SCHOLAR, and it seems likely that the analytical method employed could be extended to a wide range of conversational  situations. For example, the use of this method (Dialogue Analysis) would permit psychologists to study questions about the interactive aspects of human language processing that cannot even be considered with traditional laboratory methods.

Because of the scheme's peculiar relevance to the needs of Canadian academic libraries, the status of Latin American studies and relevant library collections in Canada are first considered. The achievement of CILA and its limitations are reviewed in the historic and economic context of the problems involved in the distribution and acquisition of library materials from Latin America. Considerable attention is devoted to a study of these problems, and a brief survey is made of some of the attempts to overcome them. With this background, the purposes and operation of CILA are examined and an attempt is made to  evaluate its contribution to the partial solution of some of the aforementioned problems. Finally, a number of conclusions are drawn from the examination. (Author)",

        "description":"A survey was conducted of the salaries paid to the professional librarians staffing the various libraries of the Florida State University System. The data collected indicated the following average salaries for the seven major types of positions: 1) directors- $24,500; 2) assistant directors-$16,549; 3) branch heads-$14,432; 4) department heads-$12,687; 5) curators and specialists-$12,475; 6) associate librarians-$11,409; and 7) assistant librarians-$9833. A total of 244 full-time equivalency positions was identified; 69 percent of these were filled by women, up from 66.5 percent the previous year. Minority employment was 13.6 percent, down from 15.2 percent the year before. Since the survey showed that a) the salaries paid by the state system were lower, on the average, than  those found in other states and b) that males were paid more than females and minority staff less than non-minority employees, it was recommended that steps be taken to raise salaries to a level competitive with those found elsewhere and to eliminate internal salary discriminations based upon sex or race.

Existing information system inadequacies were diagnosed; a new concept was proposed and empirically tested. The concept was put into effect on a small scale and used to project the requirements of an expanded operation, and a full-scale system was implemented. The system focused upon the information specialists who linked information requirements generated by the curriculum to information resources; task models of courses were constructed and used to derive information needs and to evaluate products and services. The system proved to be effective, for interactions  with librarians rose by a factor of three for students and 14 for faculty. Material provided from off-site sources increased tenfold and the judged effectiveness of disseminated materials was around 85 percent. Professors expanded the range of material in their courses and modified the format of some courses due to the availability of the information specialists, who became the partners of the professors in enriching the educational experiences of the students.

The goals of the reform were to increase enrollments, eliminate tuition in public schools, lower failure rates, retrain teachers, improve the curriculum, and train students for service and technical careers. Changes in the system at least partially attributable to the use of instructional television (ITV) included a tripling of public school enrollments, increased student achievement, the development of positive attitudes toward education and technology, the improvement of teaching, and the general raising of educational aspirations. Other developing nations seeking educational reform can profit by following El Salvador's example regarding strong  leadership and the use of a system approach, but should be cognizant of several attendant problems. These include: 1) the difficulty of providing personnel and facilities to produce ITV programing; 2) the need to uncover better ways of implementing change in traditional societies; 3) rising absolute costs, even when the system is cost-effective; and 4) the tendency of students to maintain unrealistic educational aspirations and to adhere to an outmoded but prestigious academic curriculum.

The modified course aimed to give students the opportunity to solve realistic problems. Ten films were produced depicting typical problems officers encounter and classes receiving training were divided into small groups to discuss problems immediately after viewing the film. A representative of each group then participated in a panel discussion before the entire class. Both students and instructors had positive attitudes toward the new technique. Students' comments reflected a broadening of their points of view in dealing with leadership problems and they gained experience in analyzing problems and showed increased confidence in their judgement. Students  who received the special training showed greater improvement in the quality of their solutions to leadership problems than did students who underwent regular training; furthermore, students from the experimental classes were also better judges of who the best leaders in the class were. It was concluded that the use of the sound film-discussion technique would improve present leadership training. (Author/LB)",

Several types of programs were established to meet the differing needs of local departments: a one-day, 8-hour seminar and a 14-week, 82-hour evening program for smaller departments; a two-day seminar for matrons, a two-week, 80-hour program for medium-sized departments; a four-week, 160-hour program for larger departments, and correspondence courses and video tape training for followup. Ninety percent of the material is oriented toward behavioral science; the remainder concerns record keeping and related matters. The programs were established as accredited courses at the community colleges at which they were held. Response to the training program  for matrons was particularly enthusiastic and greatly exceeded expectations. Response was also overwhelmingly enthusiastic to the \"jailing the jailers\" phase of training conducted to sensitize officers to the reality of imprisonment. The lockup phase was conducted as follows: (1) trainees were processed like ordinary criminal suspects; (2) all lights were kept on and all windows closed; (3) no radios, books or games were allowed; (4) contact between guards and trainees was kept to a minimum; (5) trainees were not told when they would be released (they were actually imprisoned for 24 hours); and (6) a six-hour encounter group was held immediately after release. In one year, 448 persons from 87 law enforcement agencies were trained, totals which more than quadrupled expectations.  (KM)",

The investigation also was concerned with any job stability differences between the four-year college graduates of business-marketing programs and the two-year college graduates, with the need for a close working relationship with the merchants, and with an effective student-job program. The questionnaire responses of 161 (a 55 percent response) retail business firms throughout the U. S. and Canada were analyzed. Personal interviews were used as a supplementary method. The following conclusions were reached: (1) The  two-year junior college retail program is adequate education for students seeking careers in retail mid-management positions. (2) Many retail merchants believe the two-year junior college retail graduate to be more stable than the four-year business-marketing graduate. (3) A number of merchants are unacquainted with the two-year junior college retail program. (4) A high level of industriousness is essential for success in retail management, and there are ample well-paying positions for the two-year retail graduates. (5) Communities should provide two-year junior colleges with retail management programs of high quality and their graduates with suitable employment. (Author/KM)",

During a conference, the student and counselor can enter the courses chosen into the computer system. At the end of the interview, the counselor touches the\"send\" button and the courses chosen are stored by the computer.

        "description":"The Essex County College Learning Resources Center was established within a two-month period in 1968, allowing no time to train personnel, develop procedures, or do organized planning. Consequently, the Director developed a tight central leadership and decision-making system. It was decided that the organization needed a management system that would guide the organization toward pre-set goals, decentralize decision-making, provide performance standards, improve individual performance, increase motivation, and create participative management. The management by objectives (MBO) system was chosen. Staff were trained in MBO procedures. Written objectives were prepared for projects to be executed between February, 1972 and January, 1973. A scheduling board was set up to facilitate  visual followup of the projects. Evaluative procedures for testing the results were also set up. Findings show that there is better planning, since department heads have to prepare objectives periodically. MBO improved the Director's performance by decentralizing his authority. Evaluation is facilitated through the wealth of quantitative and qualitative data offered by MBO. It was concluded, based on one year of testing, that MBO provided considerable administrative improvement. (KM)",

        "description":"A course in post-Civil War U. S. history was offered through a local newspaper during the fall semester of 1973. One instructional unit was presented each week for 13 weeks in the newspaper, and the final exam was offered on campus. Weekly units included behavioral objectives, historical interpretation, self-tests, and bibliographies. The mid-term was given in the newspaper as one of the units. The exam was returned to the college for scoring, but the grade did not affect the student's course grade. Those who passed the final exam were given three hours of undergraduate credit in U. S. history. Optional open-discussion forums were held on campus during the course, and the instructor was available for conferences twice a week. A course evaluation form was included in the last  newspaper unit. A followup questionnaire will be sent in September of 1974 to those who completed the course. By the night of the final exam, 130 people had paid the course tuition fee; 118 took the final exam and 115 passed it. Evaluation questionnaires revealed that 63 percent of those who finished the course were women, over 50 percent of whom were over 30 years old. Over half indicated that an important reason for taking the course was their inability to attend classes on campus. (KM)",

Four groups were studied, those first enrolled in fall 1971, spring 1972, fall 1972, and spring 1973. Results showed that: (1) the attrition rate for full-time students has declined markedly; (2) the attrition rate for part-time students has increased very slightly; (3) for full-time students, the attrition rate over the summer is much higher than between the fall and spring semesters; (4) for full-time non-returnees, the most frequently listed reasons were employment and transfer to another school; (5) for part-time non-returnees, the most frequently listed reason was that they were interested in only one course; (6) the number of transfers and readmits who enroll for the first time is fairly  constant for either fall or spring semesters, while most new first-timers enroll in a fall semester; (7) of the total fall 1971 enrollment, nearly 31% have graduated before fall 1973 (42.5% of the full-time, 12.4% of the part-time); (8) of the new, first-time, full-time fall 1971 students, 26.5% graduated before fall 1973; (9) of the full-time students who were returning in fall 1971, nearly 60% graduated before fall 1973; (10) during the five-semester period of study, 112 students out of a total population of 2,390 dropped out for at least one semester and were then readmitted; and (11) attrition in general remains more constant for part-timers than for full-timers. For full-timers, the attrition rate tends to level off after the first couple of semesters. (Author/KM)",

According to planning documents and the perceptions of administrators and staff at Rio Hondo College, the Exploratory College was supposed to lead students to: make career choices, gain personal development, understand the relationships among academic disciplines, participate in their community, explore various academic paths, and learn what they would in an unpressured environment. It was also to offer faculty a chance to develop new forms of curriculum and instruction and demonstrate and disseminate new ideas. With such a variety and  number of expectations, the college cannot help to meet every expectation. The college has allowed students to explore various academic disciplines but not helped them less to make career choices. The college has allowed participants to learn in an unpressured environment, but has not developed more community participation. In view of the conservative nature of the students at the community college, the exploratory college has been quite successful in attracting between 130 and 150 students per term. The exploratory college is unlikely to expand either its enrollment or its curriculum because by its nature, a program such as this will not attract large numbers of students or faculty. (KM)",

Most PhDs would not be happy working under community college conditions; e.g., teaching only basic courses with virtually not support for research or other professional activities.

To obtain the needed information, answers were sought for the following questions: (1) How successful were the students on the State Board Test Pool Examination? (2) How did the average scores on the five areas of the test compare with the average test scores of the graduates of the classes of 1958-1962? (3) How successful were they in finding employment? (4) What was their earning power? (5) What kind of attitudes  did the graduates have toward the program? and (6) What recommendations, if any, did they suggest for improvement of the program? Questionnaires were sent to the 78 graduates of the 1973 program of which only 18 were returned. The responses are tabulated or listed. These show that the graduates had little trouble finding employment, and in areas of nursing that they preferred. Starting salaries were good. Only two respondents reported that they were currently enrolled in courses to further their education. A comparison of scores between the two groups of graduates showed that the department is preparing students as well today as it was previously. The study conclusion is that the college is providing a valuable service to the community through its nursing program. A copy of the  questionnaire is provided. (DR)",

To implement  CAMPUS/COLORADO on a statewide basis, each institution must first create a data base that is compatible with a common statewide data base. When this has been done, institutional MIS's can be generated from the same data base. In addition, manpower and financial assistance should be supplied to any institution contemplating the CAMPUS/COLORADO model. Institutions currently implementing this model should validate it within the scope of a statewide data base before other institutions implement it. A central statewide computer center should also be established. (KM)",

The study summarizes the development trends of the decade of the sixties and the larger economic and social factors which are expected to influence development during the seventies. The second part of the study reviews some of the  lessons to be drawn from national and international experience in developing those essential social services, and in seeking greater community participation and voluntary effort in their planning and implementation. The third part of the study attempts to bring together the main conclusions bearing on planning for children and adolescents at the national level. The appendix includes a tentative discussion on priorities for children in different regions of the less developed world. (Author/CS)",

Under title IV-A, states receive federal funds for child-care programs to help welfare families move from dependency to economic self-sufficiency. Findings of the study indicate that HEW needs an adequate reporting and control system to effectively administer the program. Contract weaknesses, questionable enrollee eligibility, low attendance, fiscal discrepancies, and problems relating to the local share of program costs have hampered program effectiveness and increased costs. Federal coordination is needed to overcome problems of operating multiple  federal programs which provide similar services in the same geographic areas.

It was also possible to measure nonverbal communication in young children. A second study was designed to replicate the first and to relate  individual differences in expressiveness to other measures of emotional expression.

The performance of preschool children on several oddity tasks dealt with transfer between oddity problems in which stimulus types were Identity-Difference, Identity-Similarity, or Similarity-Difference. Based upon performance in these tasks, children were assigned to either of two groups and the relation of age to acquisition and transfer was explored, using the standard oddity presentation. A final series of five experiments were run with nursery school children investigating the possible  perception of both the perceptual and numerical differences present in a standard oddity task as well as the variables controlling initial acquisition of a numerical difference problem. The data from these studies indicate that considerable cognitive evaluation is possible in preschool children. (Author/CS)",

Current educational research is interpreted and distinctions are made between academic and intellectual goals, between achieving and learning, between performing and teaching, and between excitement and sustained interest. Some principles are suggested for teachers to remember: (1) goals and objectives really count, (2) attend to how children feel, (3) problems in education are also problems in society, (4) support a leader selected because he is competent, (5) identify your own assignment and do it well, (6) when meeting with colleagues and leaders, identify the problem to be solved (not the  personalities), (7) remember the distinction between selling an idea and teaching, and (8) don't expect quick results. Finally, it's more important to inspire a mother's confidence in her child than to do what is pedagogically proper. (SET)",

A detailed discussion of the application of theory to classroom practice is also presented. This is an in-depth statement of the Cognitively Oriented Curriculum centering on the structure of the classroom environment and the sequencing of learning  experiences. The next section describes the classroom program operations and staff roles for the High/Scope model. Parent participation is then discussed, with emphasis on educational home visits, parent group meetings, and parent volunteers in the classroom.

Based upon data available in documents pertaining to children, interviews with scholars involved in research on child care programs, and on-site observations at child care settings in Israel, Sweden, and the United States, this paper attempts to formulate a thesis on the kinds of social environments and interpersonal relationships which are most conducive to learning and academic achievement. Data has been compiled and discussed according to three major topics: role of the child, role of the parent, and role of the caretaker. The most general conclusion that can be drawn about the child care  systems, in the United States and elsewhere, is that they are not providing enough of the kinds of care children need most. A second observation is that increased attention and concern in the United States should be paid to the discontinuities between our values and our behavior with respect to children. (CS)",

Among the factors which must be considered are: the students, occupations taught, cooperating employers, the school district, supporting staff, scheduling, coordinator availability, student supervision, record keeping, and related youth group activities. The teacher-coordinator must have the time and assistance necessary to properly perform essential coordination activities. A class of fifteen to twenty students, prepared training sponsors, and staff of paraprofessionals and clerical workers approach these criteria. Certain competencies must be possessed by staff members, and though there may be some variation among position specifications,  some general categories of competency are: performance, enthusiasism, ability to relate to students, flexibility, creativity, and proper projected attitude. Compensation and evaluation efforts must be examined, and inservice education opportunities should be available. Combining these elements with tested sources for personnel recruitment will contribute to a successful cooperative vocational education program. (AG)",

Answers from the 82 percent of questionnaires returned are tabulated and discussed. Some conclusions were that teacher education institutions need to take more active roles in preparing coordinators as advisors, women need to be recruited as coordinators, and that suggested guidelines be set up for organizations. Further areas of concern indicated were the student population to be served, leadership conferences, in-service coordinator training, and sources of funds. (EA)",

While many of the problems have been present since the founding of the U.S., the expansion in numbers of and need for occupational institutions and community junior colleges have emphasized the problems. A status study of occupational program articulation efforts between vocational-technical schools and junior colleges in four Southeastern States (Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and Tennessee) was made to determine institutional characteristics (geographic proximity of the two types of school, a comparison of occupational programs offered, credit offered, and the administrator's view on program design which could affect the perceived need for articulation); the nature and  extent of present articulation practices; and suggestions for their improvement. The study was limited to public post-secondary vocational-technical schools and junior colleges in the four States. A 90 percent return of usable questionnaires indicated considerable duplication of programs with little articulation realized. Articulation at the local level was apparent, but insufficient in terms of the magnitude of the problem. It was recommended that each institution exert an effort to overcome the identified deficiencies in articulation practices. (AG)",

The difference between the multiple jobholding rates of Negro and of white workers was not statistically significant. Men whose primary jobs were as teachers below the college level or as protective service workers had the highest moonlighting rates. Men who were postal workers on their first jobs also had a high multiple jobholding rate. Most male multiple jobholders held a full-time job while working at a second job, but female moonlighters were about equally divided between those who had two part-time jobs and those who had a full-time and a  part-time job.

A budget study showed that little long-range planning for training and development is carried out at top levels. Disincentives to training  occur as a result of personnel ceiling reductions and restrictions on travel. A study was made of the role of employee development specialists. Indepth case studies were carried out in three Federal agencies representing varied missions, organizational structures, sizes, and grade levels and occupations, by questionnaire and interview. It was found that supervisors and managers train and develop employees unsystematically and mostly for short-term objectives. (MS)",

The ideal planning process begins with preparation for planning (forming and training a planning committee, duties of coordinator and staff, convening the committee). Next the needs for data collection are determined. The district planning model is composed of eight sectors, each representing a major operating center or otherwise active component of a school district. Data collected is then analyzed and goals and  objectives are set. The first series of committee work sessions culminated in school board action establishing short and long term objectives. The second series of sessions leads to the approval of operating plans by the board of subsequent budgeting and implementation. (MS)",

The system developed consists of involving and orienting key groups, analyzing educational systems, defining goals, selecting or creating career education programs, preparing for program installation, implementing a career education program, and  evaluating career education programs.

The Davidson Community College approached the problem by studying management information systems in other North Carolina institutions, searching ERIC, and pursuing leads in journals of education and data processing as the first part of a two-year Occupational Education Research Project. Registration, grade reporting, and student records constituted the bases for the data bank since these areas are the repetitive, large volume bases for any educational management information system. Of the many systems that would serve their needs, they chose one based on the principle of collecting data only once, at the original  source; recording the data on punched cards; and transferring them to computer center random access disk files where access was available by computer terminal. This system makes available data otherwise unavailable, which can have far-reaching effects. The report documents the searches and computer programs studied. Correspondence and sample documents are included in the appendixes. (AG)",

        "description":"This paper presents several aspects of task analyses for maintenance jobs when these analyses are used as bases for the development of Job Performance Aids (JPAs) and job oriented training. It starts with a brief history of the development of task analysis technology and the part that Air Force research has played in this development. The fact that task identification is the first step in any task analysis is emphasized. After tasks are identified, the type of analysis depends on the purpose for which the analysis is being made. Task identification, based primarily on hardware analysis, is the most appropriate basis for maintenance jobs. A scheme or format to accomplish this, called a Task Identification Matrix, is presented and described. Also mentioned are a Task Description  Index and Management Matrix, Task Step Data Detail Test Equipment and Tool Use Form. (The original paper was accompanied by a slide presentation and the greater part of the document consists of reproductions of these slides.

The first four chapters provide an introduction to the subject of career development, reviewing its history, representation in the literature, and philosophical basis. Chapter 5 addresses the first capability through the development of the position specification catalog. Chapter 6 describes an automated personnel information system to meet the second  capability. Chapter 7 suggests a variety of developmental programs to blend needs with resources. Final chapters describe the task force approach, the dynamics of the system, and projections for the second year of the program. Appendixes include an industrial survey, law enforcement survey, position specifications task force manual, and Automated Personnel Information System implementation plan. (MS)",

The sample group consisted of Faculty and Preceptor respondents from dental auxiliary programs in sixteen accredited institutions of higher education in a midwestern State. They were asked to respond to a Dental Task Inventory of 625 dental task assignments to identify the level of responsibility to which they taught the task and the cumulative time spent teaching each task. The responses were keypunched and respondents' reliability determined by analyzing paired statement response. Faculty respondents  had a high level of response stability but had difficulty deciding whether or not they taught a task. The Preceptors showed less response stability, knew whether or not they taught a task, but were unsure at which level they taught the task. No reliable responses were obtained to the question of time spent teaching each task. Task data coupled with biographical data and program profiles resulted in descriptions of the various programs. Approximately 100 pages of supportive material are appended to the document. (AG)",

A series of chi-square analyses  determined that 33.3 percent of the sample were mobile. Discriminant analysis determined eighteen of the best discrimination variables pertaining to personal characteristics, geography, and demography. Those results were also discussed and analyzed to understand mobility of occupational educators in a broader sense. Hopefully, the study will serve as a base for more sophisticated and refined research on the labor market and mobility of occupational educators.

A review of earlier self-monitoring studies suggested controls appropriate to the research design. The devices themselves proved no different from the controls. The accelerations in the last posttreatment baseline proved significantly different from all other phases for two sets of data. A third set of data yielded only a non-significant trend toward change during the last posttreatment baseline. Results suggest that:  students demonstrate limited self-directed change of performance rates with these procedures; terminating the last phase conjunctively with the end of the school year explains the fixed interval scallop; and weighting daily work more heavily may reduce scalloping and assure the longevity of self-control through the end of the school year.

Men, women, and couples who were at the law and order stage of moral reasoning were higher on sex guilt than those at other levels of morality. Male sex experience was associated with morality but female sex experience did not vary with female moral reasoning. The pattern of results suggests that the males' moral reasoning is a better predictor of a couple's sexual behavior than is the females'. Males in mixed morality couples seem to be dominant in setting standards, which women accede to, even if they are guilty about their behavior. (Author)",

        "description":"A group of 24 seventh-grade students was involved in a meditation (zen) experience as a means of assessing the relationship of meditation to learning. Using a simple rote memory task as both a pre-test and a post-test the experimental group (N=16) showed a significant increase (.01) in the number of objects recalled, whereas with the control group no significant increase occured. This suggests that meditation, which leads to greater self-awareness, facilitates greater attentiveness to learning. However, on a second post-test given six months after the meditation experience had ended, no significant increases were noted between the post-tests of either group. The experimental group, though, had not continued the meditation practice after termination of the program suggesting the  process had not been fully internalized during the time they had been involved in the actual meditation experience.

The major purposes of the study were to: develop a package of affective educational materials; train classroom teachers in the philosophies and techniques of the program; and implement and evaluate the programs in the schools involving children, their parents, and community resources. Subjects included 677 elementary school children, in kindergarten through fourth grades, from three socioeconomic groups who were divided into experimental and control groups. Data for the study was collected by several standardized self-report instruments, teacher and parent questionnaires, and on-site observations of the subjects. Conclusions were as  follows: (1) the program can provide significant and positive changes in knowledge of the principals of social causality; (2) social behavior in the classroom can be significantly improved through the program; (3) the program has a tendency to produce positive changes in female pupils, and no change or negative changes in male pupils; (4) subjects in the low socioeconomic group exhibited lower pretest scores than did the high socioeconomic subjects and significantly greater posttest changes than did the control group; (5) parents need to be educated on the philosophies of the program to make it successful.

Twenty-six male and 22 female undergraduate volunteers were randomly assigned to 12 \"human relations\" groups, comprising three replications of four conditions: 1. instructions only (I); 2. instructions plus feedback (IF); 3. instructions plus therapist (IT); 4. instructions plus feedback and therapist (IFT). Ss in all four conditions received instructions suggesting that open, frank discussions were facilitated by focusing on each individual's 'here-and-now' feelings, whether positive or negative, by providing feedback about how actions of the others affected S's feelings, and by empathizing or  trying to understand the other's feelings. Three therapists were assigned to one replication of each of the two therapist conditions, Ss in the feedback conditions were told that the digital counters with attached red lights which were placed in front of them would provide them with information about how well they were following instructions. Analysis of variance yielded significant effects for feedback and therapist, suggesting that operant techniques may be as effective as the presence of a therapist in a group, and also serve as an important adjunct.

A secondary purpose was to determine the effectiveness of the community school (3 to 9 P.M.) in creating for itself an ancillary guidance role to enhance and extend the services of the core program (9 A.M. to 3 P.M.). Subjects were 188 inner-city seventh grade youth from five participating junior high schools in Washington, D.C. Pretest-posttest gains of the subjects were determined by the California Test of Personality. Other participants were subjects' parents, who received the counseling and  applied at home what they learned. There were three treatment groups: structured, unstructured (placebo), and control (nontreatment). Statistically significant gains were observed in the posttreatment awareness of the subjects in selected self-concept centered personal and social life adjustment techniques. The structured group process proved more effective than the unstructured group process for the 13-week period. In the flexible community school program, mortality was minimal. (Author/LP)",

The following six factors, frequently ignored in recent research, receive consideration: (1) identifying the intended target audience; (2) specifying the nature of the relationship; (3) isolating the communication modes; (4) determining the authenticity of disclosures; (5) determining the intimacy of disclosures; and (6) using individual differences data.

In virtually all of the research reported, the positive influence of counselor-led activities is a result of some designated competence applied in a systematic way to a specific need of children, teachers or parents.

In an interpersonal exchange situation, persons who violated the above norms were evaluated less favorably by subjects and were attributed more responsibility for a negative event than non-norms violators. Surprisingly, subjects (1) failed to aggress against unfavorably evaluated norm violators, and (2) evaluated  aggressive persons as favorably as nonaggressive ones.

On these measures dropout from earlier grades was associated with lower marks and test scores and being older in the third grade than dropouts from later grades. Results showed that the strongest predictors of when a dropout will leave school are also among the measures that differentiate dropouts from graduates. From the finding it was concluded that in identifying potential dropouts, one can  concurrently determine the severity of problems that may lead to early rather than late dropout, thus providing a basis for establishing priorities in the need for intervention to prevent future school failure and dropout.

Several major strategies are described, along with basic \"Operators\" subject used to construct and modify hypotheses. An information-processing model of the strategies is described, and its implementation as a computer-simulation discussed. Study two investigates cognitive styles in problem solving. Cognitive processes (strategies) used by 114 male undergraduates were retrieved through cluster analysis of self-reports from Strategy Assessment Questionnaires. The results suggest that \"styles of processing\" do not play a major role in problem  solving, but rather that problem-solving processes are primarily task dependent adaptions. Study three describes the construction of several preliminary learning Strategy Assessment Scales based on specific college learning situations such as reading, lecture processing, and memorization. Subjects were 150 undergraduates. Conclusions are that: (a) cognitive strategies in a variety of learning and problem-solving situations can be reliably measured by psychometrically based scales; (b) a general procedure for constructing such scales can be outlined, and (c) the usefulness to education of such procedures can be discussed in terms of The Aptitude Treatment Interaction Paradigm.

        "description":"This study seeks to discover which aspects of a student's background, alone or in combination with the kind of school attended, play the greatest role in achievement. The paper presents results of a wide variety of analyses that explore different aspects of family background and the school as they relate to achievement of students of differing racial-ethnic and sex-group membership and geographical origin. The individual student is the primary unit of analysis. The principal finding is that, although factors of home and family greatly outweigh school factors in achievement, all the differences in achievement associated with racial-ethnic group membership can be accounted for by considerations that are social in nature and origin. The greatest role is played by a set of  motivational factors that are closely related to child rearing practices. The most important are: (1) the expectations that both the student and his parents have for his school performance; (2) the extent to which families engage in activities that are supportive of these expectations; and (3) the student's understanding of the importance of hard work to success, as well as the possible benefits of an education.

This study was designed to produce comparative descriptive data on Project GO and regularly admitted CSU freshmen samples and to evaluate the efficiency of traditional academic predictors for all freshmen. Comparison of the 1968, 1969 and 1970 Project GO freshmen classes revealed significant differences on predictor variable scores (SAT-Verbal, SAT-Math and High School Percentile Rank (HSPR), as well as significant differences in GPA and persist rates. These differences were attributable to relaxed admittance requirements in 1969. Similar sex differences were found for Project GO and regularly admitted  freshmen, with females having significantly higher HSPR and males obtaining higher SAT-M scores. Project GO students scored lower on all of the predictor and performance measures than the regularly admitted 1970 freshmen. The 1969 GO persisters showed a significant downward trend in GPA with each successive quarter. Regression equations calculated to predict Fall GPA for both both GO and regularly admitted CSU freshmen were strikingly similar and accounted for only a small portion of the variance. This lends support to the contention that traditional academic predictors such as SAT-V, SAT-M, and HSPR need to be augmented by nontraditional variables. (Author)",

Basically, however, childbearing motivations can be divided into four categories: altruistic, fatalistic, narcissistic, and instrumental. Children can fulfill a variety of needs which appear to shift through time and vary among individuals. Particular attention is given to those needs which children seem to meet in our highly technological, impersonal western society, i.e. needs for identity, intimacy, and self-actualization. A crucial concern is how to satisfy these needs without further aggravating the population crisis and without denying people the right to determine their own reproductive  behavior. (Author/LAA)",

No assets accrue from disability; a family has only those potentials it had earlier which may be abandoned or poorly used by a family in its coping endeavors, or utilized fully in making needed adjustments. The self-concept of a family need not be abandoned because of disability; in fact, a family may discover its central values and goals--a constructive rather than destructive process. The family as a social unit depends upon a range of supports to meet basic needs. Many of these resources exist within, and can be used to maintain the family as a unit. The disabled member must have a reciprocating function within the family even  though he may have greatly altered capabilities, or the relationship will not endure. (Author/LAA)",

        "description":"During the late 1960's and early 1970's, American society experienced high levels of student political activity. Through 1970 most of this activity was outside the realm of traditional politics (i.e., demonstrations and protests), but in 1971 the 26th Amendment took effect, enfranchising millions of young voters and changing the arena of political activity. Survey data gathered from personal interviews with 442 undergraduates, collected at yearly intervals spanning the transition period, are presented. These data reveal that, contrary to findings in adult samples, student electoral campaign participation was linked to high political alienation and unrelated to political efficacy during 1970. The last survey, following the 1972 election, indicated findings consistent with the  adult population. Additional data suggesting differential impact of agents of the political socialization process on demonstrators and non-demonstrators are presented and analyzed. Turnover of the student body, the type of election campaign, and expressive versus instrumental functions of participation are considered as possible explanations for differences observed over time.

Approximately 1,870 public and parochial students participated in piloting thecurriculum. Staff from the Lakewood City Schools and The Educational Research Council of America, together with outside consultants, worked cooperatively in developing a curriculum for two-level elementary, middle and high school. Control and experimental classes were established for piloting the curriculum according to a detailed evaluation plan. Students and teachers were pre- and post-tested with knowledge and attitude measures. Experimental students showed significant growth on knowledge tests with significant  differences resulting on the attitude measures among students at the middle and high school levels, and positive trends evident at the elementary level. In addition, experimental teachers showed growth in causal thinking. Revised editions of the curriculum were developed on the basis of feedback from students, teachers, experts who critiqued the curriculum and data analysis. Reaction to the project on the local, statewide, and national level justifies further dissemination, with continued research on effectiveness, and ongoing revision. (Author)",

The total sample included 1000 male and female adolescents (ages 13-18) randomly drawn from 32 public school systems in West Virginia following a design using longitudinal sequences and control groups. Longitudinal subjects (birth cohorts 1954-1957) were measured in 1970, 1971, and 1972 with Cattell's High School Personality Questionnaire, Jackson's Personality Research Form, and Thurston'es Primary Mental Abilities. A random sample of retest control subjects was measured in 1972 only. Analyses were aimed at examination of main and interaction effects of age/cohort, sex and time of measurement on 16 personality and  ability measures and of intraindividual change and stability on these measures from 1970 to 1972. Control group data were analyzed for testing and selective dropout effects. Findings indicated that age per se is not a very relevant variable. Rather, (1) developmental change is more influenced by the cultural moment than by age sequences; and (2) traditional, simple cross-sectional or longitudinal designs are not adequate for describing developmental change. Theorizing about adolescent development must move toward a dynamic conception of \"the changing individual in a changing society\". This will mandate rapprochement between ontogenetic and evolutionary models of development. (Author)",

Graen (1967), through hiring 169 high school girls to do a clerical task, showed that ability measures can account for far more performance variance than motivation variables such as expectancy and instrumentality. Similar results were obtained in investigations by Arvey (1970) and Loehr (1970). In the most comprehensive investigation, Pritchard, Dunnette, and Jorgenson (1972) confirmed deductions from both Equity Theory and Expectancy Theory, but their results also showed that different conditions of work incentive may facilitate or disrupt the expression of ability differences in work performance. It is argued from results of these several studies that simpler  measures rather than more complicated ones need to be investigated as psychologists continue to try to account for the non-ability part of human work performance. Less emphasis should be placed on 'motivation per se and more placed on learning about the dimensional makeup of the missing term in the equation: PERFORMANCE equals ABILITY plus WHAT? (Author)",

Psychometric classifications of human performances most often are based on the covariation of individual differences. A model is presented which justifies the expectation that the transfer from learning one task to learning another is linearly dependent on the coefficient of intercorrelation between the two tasks when the coefficient is corrected for attenuation. Two studies so far have explicitly confirmed the main deductions from this model. Contrary to the predictions, however, the regression curves yielded negative intercepts. Two  empirically testable explanations are offered, one of which would be in full accordance with the model, while the other would call for a further assumption. (Author)",

The data are drawn from a questionnaire administered to 704 obstetrical patients, 81 percent of whom were black. Separate comparisons were made for single and married respondents. Few of the blacks felt that illegitimacy is wrong, but black-white differences on this issue were small. However, the blacks (1) less frequently preferred marital childbearing; (2) more often held negative attitudes toward marriage in general; (3) less often felt that husbands they knew measured up on certain marital behaviors which they considered important; and (4) more  often believed that men would rather be single than married. For all but the last of these four findings, the racial differences were greater for the single than the married respondees. Marital attitudes and preferences for marital childbearing appear to be factors in the lower-income black women's somewhat lower rate of ever marrying, and her much greater tendency to delay marriage until sometime after she has borne children.

The field test was carried out in eight Wisconsin multiunit schools. Each school or unit developed its own list of prosocial behaviors which was used to measure the progress of all pupils. Different numbers of pupils from the schools were then chosen to participate in small-group conferences in which specific behaviors were discussed and individual goals were set. The main conclusions were that: (a) participating pupils improved significantly on those self-directed prosocial behaviors discussed in conferences; (b) this improvement was maintained when assessed six to eleven weeks after conferences ended; and (c) although the  pupils chosen for conferences manifested significantly fewer prosocial behaviors before the conferences than those students not included, they manifested as many at the end of the conference period. It is assumed that schools would not normally end a conference period until their goals were met. The design of the field test, however, included a period without conferences to evaluate the long-term effects of the procedure. The overall conclusion derived from the field test is that the motivational-instructional procedure is a viable means to increase the incidence of pupils' self-directed prosocial behavior. (Author)",

The discussion includes the considerations and implications inherent at each stage with emphasis on the effect of the various decisions upon child, parent, extended family, and society as a whole. The purpose of the model is to give adolescents knowledge and training in problem solving and decision-making so that they can discover the alternatives, examine the various implications and relate these to their  own individual needs and values. The model could provide a framework for discussion which would encourage sexual decision-making on the basis of long-range implications rather than on short-term needs. (Author)",

        "description":"A review of the literature indicates that measures of the McClelland-Atkinson need-Achievement (nAch) construct are weak in terms of both reliability and validity. The most serious weakness of the model's validity is the lack of evidence for the hypothesized positive relationship between nAch and performance. In addition, the inverse relationship between the probability of success and the incentive value of success is not supported. The nAch model is shown to be closely related to expectancy theory. The success of the nAch construct in predicting risk preference is explained with an analysis of the information obtainable by attempting tasks of different probabilities of success. Moderate risks are shown to offer maximum information, whereas tasks of high or low risk offer minimum  information. Hence, what has been termed &quot;need Achievement&quot; is reconceptualized as the willingness to seek information about one's own performance capacity. This, in turn, is related to processes of social comparison. Information on academic performance must be presented in such a way as to minimize threats to the student's self-esteem. The analysis is related specifically to individualization of instruction and integration of classrooms. (Author)",

The sample consisted of 102 students from Ohio State University. The variables found to be most strongly associated with MDC use are self-image and social interaction. Coeds whose self-images are occupationally rather than maritally oriented are more likely to use MDC. Non-users are more likely to perceive \"pill\" users as more promiscuous, and thus tend to avoid this negative image. MDC users know more girlfriends who are having premarital sexual intercourse and more who are using MDC. The user's sexual behavior is also known by more of their acquaintances. More encouragement to use MDC from both boyfriends and girlfriends is experienced  by the users. Finally, users are more likely to perceive that their parents would prefer they use MDC than risk pregnancy, and more likely to have voluntarily informed their parents of their sexual behavior.

The process of acquiring and utilizing this ability was conceptualized with the help of flow diagrams for algorithms. This resulted in the furthering of a new and fruitful theory of cognitive learning which stresses the formation and use of hypothesis and how to represent them. New experimental techniques were developed for measuring performance and quality of questions, on problems requiring shifts in representation. These were applied to investigate the effect of experience in learning to formulate such  problems in fifth graders and in college students. New procedures for exposing learners to such experiences were also derived and tested. Results suggest that children learn problem recognition and formulation if they are exposed to inquiry-provoking situations where they have to form hypotheses. College students with experience in having to shift representations perform better on tasks requiring such shifts than those who don't. Question-quality was demonstrated to be correlated with problem-solving performance. (Author)",

Students were interviewed in-depth concerning reasons for their choice of majors. Protocol data suggested two distinct modes of thinking were evident on an analytic-intuitive dimension. For operational purposes analytic thinking was defined by publicly verifiable and well-defined premises leading to logical-rational conclusions. Intuitive thinking was defined by emotional involvement and global impressions which formed the basis for justification and selection of a major. Questionnaires were administered to a sample of 600 undergraduates, and an index score was computed for each student reflecting the relative importance of analytic versus intuitive statements. The intuitive  dimension was found to be more important (a) to students as they progressed through school, and (b) for students in soft (Humanities) as opposed to either hard (natural sciences) or business curricula. Females with soft majors had more analytic scores than males in soft majors, and females in business majors had more intuitive scores than males in business majors. Additional analyses showed that students who had changed majors two or more times had higher intuitive scores than those who had never changed majors. (Author/LP)",

The procedure, used by Gentile, Roden and Lein (Journal of Applied Behavioral Analysis, 1972, 5) for intensive studies of single subjects, is found inappropriate because the basic assumptions of an analysis of variance model are typically violated when continuous data on a single subject is gathered over time. Two other proposed analyses of variance models for single subjects are also considered and found unsuitable. Time series analysis, which takes serial correlation effects into account, and a median-based method are recommended as alternatives to analysis of variance designs. (Author/LRP)",

Two passages for oral reading were chosen. \"First Kill\" was used for a pretesting session. The story \"My Brother is a Genius\" was used in the testing session. Prior to reading the story the subjects were informed that this was not a test which would be graded and were asked to read as best they could. Differences between groups were observed although the size of the groups was too small  to permit statistical evaluation of these differences. Some of the results indicated; group R made more miscues and showed less efficient use of graphic and phonemic cues; during the reading of the first third of the text, the R group showed strength in the use of syntactic and semantic cues equal to or greater than that of the P group; and in successive segments of the text, the R group's use of cueing systems declined markedly.

        "description":"This paper discusses criterion referenced tests' characteristics and their use in clinical evaluation. The distinction between diagnostic tests and criterion referenced measures is largely a matter of emphasis. Some authorities believe that in diagnostic testing the emphasis is upon an evaluation of an individual's strengths and weaknesses in skills areas with attention to the possible causes of problems that exist. Criterion referenced testing is less concerned with definition of disability and does not emphasize the etiology of problems. In constructing norm referenced test items, the writers of the test must select items of varying levels of difficulty. In criterion referenced measurement the scale is usually anchored at the extremes--one at the top indicating complete or  perfect mastery of some defined abilities; one at the bottom indicating absence of some skills. The items on a criterion referenced measurement should be representative of skills that are essential to learning to read. The items should be arranged in an established hierarchy that would be used for teaching reading. In a clinical situation where the number of students is small, criterion referenced measures are simply ways of determining whether goals have been met. (WR)",

Two forms of an opinionnaire were administered to determine the reading skills most frequently observed  as those which children have difficulty learning. A descriptive analysis of the data included those skills observed by the greatest percentage of respondents. The five major reading skill areas considered by primary teachers were word recognition, word analysis, comprehension, oral reading, and study skills.

The special reading classes were held each day  in addition to any other reading classes. Special Education students were all tested with either the Stanford Binet or the Wechsler Test. Their IQ's were all within the 56 to 80 range. The general objective of the program for the mentally retarded was to develop more closely the students' level of achievement to the level of their mental abilities.

Sixty-nine eighth grade students from the same school served as subjects. The Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test, Survey E, Form 1M, Comprehension subtest, was used to group students into above average, average, and below average groups. Passages were chosen from the content areas using textbooks not in general use at the school. Selected passages were taken in their entirety from each book. Cloze tests were constructed by deleting every fifth word in each passage and replacing the deleted word with a 10-spaced blank. Passages in each subject area were approximately 250 words in length, allowing for 50 deletions. The subjects  were administered the cloze tests in a group setting. The results indicated that there was a difference in comprehension due to subject matter. The subjects performed better in the content area of literature than in either science or social studies. This finding held true both for the group as a whole and, in particular, for the group that was above average in reading ability. (WR)",

In Experiment 2, A-B was acquired by associative matching. The interpolated learning was by the paired-associate anticipation method and included A-D and C-B pairs. There was no evidence for losses in A-B on a recall test. In Experiment 3, A-B was learned by a paced, multiple-choice procedure, and A-D and A-Br pairs in an interpolated list were learned under the same procedure. There was a small amount of associative unlearning following A-D, and heavy associative unlearning following A-Br. The possibility was  offered that little associative unlearning is detected by recognition measures in A-B, A-D because recognition decisions are not commonly based on associative information.

This \"culture clash\" also exists for literacy learning in that, as a national goal, reading has been imposed on certain groups whose cultures are not literate and on groups who, although their cultures are literate, see reading in English as destructive to their culture. Cultures which have long oral traditions include the Black culture, various American Indian cultures, the Chicano culture, and the Puerto Rican culture. In these societies cultural information is largely passed by word of mouth. In an orally based culture reading has little place or may be seen as peripheral to the cultural reward system. To these cultures, school  is often seen as the enculturating tool of the dominant society, and reading and literacy, as a major part of \"mainstream\" cultures, is seen as part of that enculturation. To help overcome the problem, teachers need to be aware of possible clashes in the classroom and examine in depth their own feelings and attitudes toward children who come from cultures other than their own.

The testing program that was developed consisted of administering the Tests of Modality Aptitudes in Reading (TOMAR), the Analysis of Learning Potential (ALP), and the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Tests to all students in grades one, two, and three. An assessment of the expectations of an elementary school education as viewed by patrons was conducted by the use of a questionnaire. The project was analyzed by a committee following five months of operation. The thrust of the project was shifted to focus on modality as it influences learning style.

        "description":"To this time, language arts-reading programs established by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) totally immerse the young Indian student in a complete English environment. The real problem is not so much the type of program used, but the feelings of the teachers working with the students. Until very recently, few of the teachers in BIA schools were of Native American descent. Most reading programs for the Indian student stress language performance, exercising intonation rather than language competence. For the Indian child entering school for the first time at the age of seven or eight, there are many immediate problems in adjustment. The child is faced with learning a second language, which involves becoming sensitive to new, very alien sounds, new grammatical-morphological  patterns, new word meanings, and a new underlying world view or way of ordering data. In studies conducted with Native American children in both the United States and Mexico, it was found that when students were instructed in their native speech their proficiency in the second language was greater than if they were instructed only in the national language of the country. It is felt bilingual programs would be necessary to ensure equal educational opportunity for every child. (WR)",

        "description":"Children in kindergarten, third grade, and fifth grade were presented a list of either pictures or words (with items presented varying numbers of times on the study trail). In both picture and word conditions, half of the subjects estimated how many times each item had been presented (absolute judgments) and the other half judged which of two items had occurred more often on the study trail (relative judgments). The primary findings were: (1) ability to encode and discriminate frequency for both pictures and words increased with age, and (2) picture-word differences (in favor of pictures) increased with age. The results lend support to a two-factor model of developmental change in frequency judgment performance involving pictures and words. The model provides for predictions  concerning performance on verbal discrimination and recognition memory tasks as a function of age and stimulus mode, and also suggests further research to explain picture-word differences in verbal learning tasks.

The developments discussed include: accountability and performance contracting; the use of more adults (parents, paraprofessionals, and college students) in the classroom; television--the influence of which is still undetermined; new motivation techniques; a recognition of individual differences; British infant schools and informal education; an increased awareness of the relationship of language development to reading; an acceptance of nonstandard English; and linguistics. The author indicates that none of these educational developments have changed the teaching of reading appreciably and that  the factor which can most influence reading is an improved awareness of language and its relationship to reading.

Study 2 was an investigation of phrase reading training with fourth grade children from a socially and culturally restrictive background. The phrase  reading was incorporated as part of the regular language arts curriculum. The subjects had about 5000 practice phrases and gained about one year in reading from pretest to posttest. Study 3 investigated phrase reading training with ninth grade students designated as slow learners. The results indicated negligible results for the group's reading skills.

Slatoff's book is a strenuous negative reaction to methods of studying literature that were spawned in the United States by the &quot;New Criticism&quot; and by formalistic criticism. A piece of literature is not so much an object as it is a source of an experience. It is this complex, many-faceted individual  experience which occurs when a reader involves himself with a literary work that Slatoff wishes to explore on mental, emotional, spiritual, ethical, and physiological dimensions, although he acknowledges that techniques of studying and teaching literature have not begun to provide even the most rudimentary guidelines for such a complicated understanding.

A specific literary work (in novel, poem, short story, or other form) is discussed and analyzed from these various points of view. Areas of approach include moral, psychological, historical, biographical, sociological, and &quot;new&quot; criticism.

        "description":"The study of names, onomastics, can hold a fascination for all students at every grade level and in various subjects, provided the study is approached methodically and is adaptable at every grade level. One method is to begin with concentric rings whereby the student looks first at his own name and then moves to names of people and places around him in ever widening categories. Or, one can begin by asking students to look up their given names in a dictionary and providing the student with the chance to do a dictionary exercise. By comparing last names, students can often see patterns of national origin emerging. The histories of etymologies of names can provide interesting stories and a knowledge of the history of the language and can introduce various cultural elements into name  selection. Street names, pets' names, the names of cities, topographic names, state names, and so on, can all be incorporated in various interdisciplinary studies. While moving through the various approaches to onomastics, the student can grasp the importance of names study, can begin to see order in the apparent chaos of names surrounding him, and can discover on his own other forms of names.

Each respondent completed a 24-item Likert type scale in his native language which measured four affective dimensions of attitudes toward authority: hostility, acceptance, anxiety, and neutrality. Ninety respondents were also given two sets of developmental questionnaires. The results of the study supported the hypotheses.

Structures of writing are the archetypal patterns of perception and grow out of the very structure of the human mind. Structure is imposed on the writer who wants to communicate by the reader's capacity to perceive. The analytical part of the mind uses structure as a tool for understanding in both reading and thinking. Structure is a critical tool and a creative tool as well as a learning tool. Knowledge of structure sharpens our discrimination. Some educators object to stressing structure because they feel that it stifles creativity, but knowledge of pattern actually offers a procedure for a further dimension in creativity; it liberates the inarticulate and whets  the articulate to new achievements. The goal is to know structure so completely that it becomes a part of the habits and patterns of thought and becomes totally disguised in them. (LL)",

A sociolinguistic approach maintains the goal but alters the methods, choosing to teach the skills in the context of relevant material: language against the backdrop of society, Teaching language sociolinguistically means including more than grammar; it means studying also its societal framework, its history, its regional and social dialects, its stylistic variations, and its impact on people, institutions, and literature throughout the world. Each facet of sociolinguistic study can be illustrated by literature and reinforced by students' narrative, expository, and descriptive speaking and writing. One might begin with an examination of pidgin and creole languages;  or one might look at language change, the study of dialects, style, dictionaries, English as an international language, or the way in which language both mirrors and maps the society it serves. One significant spinoff of teaching language sociolinguistically is the removal or reduction or prejudice against speechways different from the majority's.

Drama involves talk, movement, and the involvement of self in expression which is outer-directed; writing tends to involve language which is more solitary and inner-directed. But talk and the exchange of ideas serve to create a need for expression; therefore, dramatic activity can be an effective form of exploration of a topic or problem prior to the act of writing. For instructional purposes, the tasks to be accomplished in a creative writing experience are broken into a methodological sequence: children's attention focuses on a broad  topic in order to generate interest, ideas are exchanged to crystallize each child's thinking, and then a writing period follows. In the writing period young children dictate their ideas to the teacher or, after mechanics are under control, write individually. In individual writing the teacher serves as a catalyst, an audience, and an aid for mechanics upon request from the children. As creative expression began with interaction through talk, it should now return to it during a sharing period. (RB)",

In spite of the grammarians' efforts to \"disambiguate,\" it is doubtful that any willful act or combination of acts can eliminate ambiguity, since language is a system of symbols which can stand for one thing or another. Not only can our use of symbols create lexical ambiguity, but also phonetic ambiguity: homonyms, homographs, and homophones. Writers sometimes turn ambiguity to advantage through the use of metaphors, analogies, and other conceits. Or ambiguity can be used in puns wherein sense is not called for so long as some connection, however outrageous, is made. Other forms of humor also depend on ambiguity: irony, incongruity, satire, and phatic  expression. Abuses of ambiguity exist as well where unintended ambiguity may lead to undesired or undesirable results. Whatever the case for ambiguity, it is deemed necessary for societies' coping with the world. Life's accidental, unexpected quality which irks yet delights should be the clue to the conclusion that ambiguity is inescapable. (HOD)",

Secondly, he identified film as one of the \"devices for vicarious experience.\" He said that film can be used as a dramatizing device, as a tone and level setter for a class, and can provide a range of identification figures for the student. One of the pressing reasons for using and studying film is that the student needs to develop good habits of perception, analysis, judgment, and selectivity for the processing of visual data. Given the popularity of film and the power of the medium, we need to become far more sophisticated in our use of its power and just as concerned about  raising the level of our students' sophistication in response to film as we are regarding their sophistication in response to literature.

If the teacher approaches the subject from the student's point of view, the selection of materials will be influenced, thereby giving students the opportunity to respond to materials which recognize and accept a wide range of interests and tastes. Narrow categories that label books tend to limit, rather than expand, reading possibilities. Observation indicates that adults who have been taught children's literature with required reading lists often use the same required reading list when teaching children's literature to children. This can also serve as a limitation  in the selection of books to meet the interests and needs of the reader. Book report forms can serve as a limiting factor in the reader's response to a book.

The subjects, thirty-two college students enrolled in an introductory speech course, received four randomized treatments. Each treatment consisted of four 40-second tapes. Two modern language instructors read a passage from Aristotle, first in standard English and then in foreign accented English. This process yielded two standard English passages, one Spanish-accented English passage, and one French-accented English passage. The subjects listened to the tapes in varying orders depending upon  their treatment groups and then responded to a credibility scale. The results indicated that concept-scale interactions exist even when the concept is operationalized as variations in accent. The dynamism factor disappeared and the authoritativeness factor gained a negative valence when the first speaker switched from standard English to Spanish-accented English. The authoritativeness factor adopted a negative sign and the character factor a positive when switching from standard English to French-accented English. (WR)",

The teacher needs to show the students the elements that comprise good literature.

A wide array of literature should be provided in order to accommodate the interests of different children. Individual responses should be encouraged by the teacher. Children should be encouraged to  discern what happens in a piece of literature, how it happens, and why it happens. The writer's motives in his choice of words, structure, plot development, images, and rhyme and rhythm (in poetry) should be discussed and analyzed. (LL)",

This function was tested during the Kentucky gubernatorial election and the Lexington, Kentucky, mayoral election in November 1971. The specific hypothesis postulated that public identification of important issues in the campaigns would reflect the amount of media coverage devoted to these issues and that this effect would be strongest for those people with the least education and least interest in the campaign. Respondents selected at random from the Lexington telephone directory were asked what they believed were the major issues of the campaigns. Resulting data supplied as much evidence that the media reflect  public concern as that the public is influenced by media coverage. Correlations between educational levels or campaign interest and media coverage of issues could not be established. (CH)",

The performance of the subjects suggests that the child who is forced to verbalize his conceptual strategies will reach criterion faster in the discrimination learning task and will also be more successful in his attempts to transpose. With regard to transposition specifically, it was found that overt-verbal learning was significantly more effective than covert-verbal learning, and that the covert-verbal condition yielded significantly higher scores than did the control (non-forced) condition. These results point to the effectiveness of verbal  mediation in the transfer of learning. (Author)",

Its primary interest is the use of television, particularly the intense blitz by the Scott organization, which is viewed as a significant variable in the Scott victory. The case study seeks to provide insight into the uses and effects of media saturation in a state-wide election. It is accompanied by a presentation of the television materials utilized in the respective campaigns. The conclusions concerning the role of the media in the campaign are: the media were a significant variable in the outcome of the Scott-Spong election contest; the mass media, especially television, served as a catalyst that activated the potential of  other campaign factors, such as the political shift in the state and the public displeasure over forced busing; the use of strategy, placement, and exposure of materials is more determinative of election success than production quality; and as a result of the campaign, the extensive use of the mass media, especially television, has become a prominent aspect of political activity in Virginia.

In an experimental study, subject listeners were asked to identify statements in a speech that were actual declarative assertions, although some of the statements were enunciated as rhetorical questions. Results indicated that listeners who heard a speaker's rhetorical questions in an argumentative context generally perceived the test utterances as statements rather than rhetorical questions. Because of new methods of transformational grammar now being  taught, it is possible that future generations will be more sophisticated in their responses to rhetorical questions than those educated in the traditional grammar which is based on structural and functional classification of sentences.

Sophistic instruction in ancient Greece centered around techniques of oral persuasion, and the methods were attacked by Plato because they emphasized skills over truth and ethics. Plato criticized the Sophists' epistemology because their rhetoric was not based on the highest intellectual forms, mathematics and dialectics. Also, Plato claimed that the Sophists did not demonstrate a sound ethical system. Finally, Sophistic rhetoric lacked proper style. Emphases of modern communication studies into cognitive and behavioral bases for communication theories reflect the concerns of Plato. Further, as  communication instruction becomes more sensitive to social, cultural, and moral values, it tends more and more to conform to Plato's ethical standards. Despite new arts and systems, the modern communications theorist is still aware of Plato's commitments to truth, aesthetics, and ethical purpose. (RN)",

This method is of value to students both as speakers and as critics; it also assesses the behavioral outcomes of utilizing the principles taught in basic communication courses. A second procedure applies specifically to the informative speech, whereby each speaker obtains, in short written form, statements from his audience that tell him if the audience recognized and retained the important points of information from his presentation. Finally, in evaluating  persuasive speeches, student-critics can be asked to list their personal reactions to each proposition in the speeches, as well as their predictions of both the average audience response and the response distribution (scattered or clustered).

Information was obtained from station logs and observations by selected viewers on use of celebrities, explicit audience direction, fear appeal, message topic, and type of show during which the commercials appeared. Results support hypotheses that: (1) more PSA messages are broadcast during periods of lower audiences than in prime time; (2) more air  time per PSA is alloted during non-prime time periods; (3) there is a significant relationship between program content and PSA topic; and (4) more PSA's cover general topics than social problems.

Bases for selecting one form over the other include location, type of available audience, experience of the acting company, and technical advantages or disadvantages involved with lighting, costumes, scenery, and properties. From the standpoint of both the quality of direction and the actor's preparation, the repertory method holds certain advantages. Rehearsals are somewhat more leisurely and relaxed, which serves the director's production goals and facilitates actors' learning of the roles.

However, by using the interpersonal communication approach, can classroom activities be developed that can result in measurable changes in a student's self-concept? In answering this question, several groups of undergraduate students were tested, utilizing the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale. Some subjects showed little change in self-esteem following special assignments in interpersonal relationships. Where gains in self-esteem did appear, results showed that females tend to gain more than males but that exercises involving immediate and direct personal feedback in a classroom situation do not help those who presumably most need higher  self-esteem.

A stereotype reaction is not based on first-hand information about an individual, but rather on perceived cultural affiliations. It is basically an emotional response that tends to distort message decoding and interfere with understanding of persons and messages. An individual perceived to be from a different social or cultural group will be stereotyped as having the same personal traits as those perceived to be \"typical\" of the group as a whole. Changes in stereotype perception are directly related to actual changes in the nature or structure of  social or cultural groups instead of direct, sensory knowledge about individuals. (RN)",

However, results indicated clearly that, in juries, the same methods of persuasion are used in convincing abstaining jurors to join the consensus and  that most juries evidence a marked absence of status problems.

Two ways to consider the subject of values in comparative rhetoric involve values as norms and values as appeals. Values assumed to be held by the audience are the bases for persuasion and may be studied as possible appeals in public address. During Kenya's parliamentary election of 1969 the appeals of political speakers were classified into four categories: personal qualifications, audience values or dis-values, speakers' past accomplishments, and promised future accomplishments. These appeals indicate the ambivalence that was felt in this country between traditional value systems and modern or  national value systems: the wisdom of age and the youth of modern education; women's rights challenging a traditional value system; new goals of independence and nation building conjoined with pragmatic appeals for sharing the wealth. The specific content and use of value strategies depend upon the national and historical context. Therefore, to study comparative rhetoric requires in-depth preparation and access to field data, if not field work itself. (HOD)",

One of its most significant contributions to effective research is the utility of looking at several variables simultaneously. Another contribution of multiple regression analysis is the various types of data that may be analyzed. The researcher may study mutually exclusive dichotomous scores depicting group membership as a variable. The researcher may also study continuous variables such as test scores or ages of subjects. Another characteristic of multiple regression analysis is its ease of application to field studies. The major weakness of multiple regression analysis lies in its assumption of  causality. The major method for controlling this deficiency lies in the logic of the research design. The design should include all of the recognized independent variables and may be discovered through two approaches. The first approach is to review the literature relevant to an area of research, discerning from past studies what the major independent variables have been. The second approach involves using factor analysis and multiple regression as complements to one another. (WR)",

Another exercise is to have each person write a confidential self-inventory of himself as a conversationalist, mentioning both liabilities and assets.

In more recent times the surveys compiled by Harold Niven for the \"Journal of Broadcasting\" show a continued interest in broadcasting courses. The trend is toward Communications or Radio-TV Departments. Three general philosophies have arisen about how to best teach students about broadcasting: (1) the liberal arts philosophy, an introduction to the field of broadcasting; (2) the practical philosophy, an attempt to furnish complete professional training for employment; and (3) the liberal professional philosophy, a broad liberal arts background plus professional training for first job skills and a basic knowledge of  the industry. The practical, professional curriculum has drawbacks: half of all broadcast majors do not find jobs in broadcasting; and acting, writing, and directing, which are most exciting to students and most appealing to teachers, are least likely to provide work opportunities for graduates.

Merleau-ponty's conceptions stand in opposition to Saussure's linguistic postulations and Korzybski's scientism. That is, if language is studied phenomenologically, the acts of speech and gesture take on greater importance than language as currently viewed in structural linguistics and general semantics. Merleau-Ponty stressed the &quot;meaning&quot; or &quot;signification&quot; aspects of language and postulated a theory of linguistic signs which suggests that &quot;language is gesture.&quot; This approach allows the expressive qualities of the communicational act to become apparent, since it considers both nonverbal and verbal communication. Thus, the existential  phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty has much to contribute to the study of language. (CH)",

The issue is made more complex since linguistics disagree about the nature of black English, who uses it, and the aims and strategies of instruction most suitable for those speakers. Teacher training programs should be based on a \"social-contextual\" approach to communication. Students should be taught to be eloquent in varied communication situations. Further, all speakers of English, in spite of wide varieties of dialect, share a basic common written language, and linguistic  differences are a result of social and cultural differences in all segments of English-speaking societies. Teachers should seek understanding of the various backgrounds and value systems that form the contexts of individual communication situations. (RN)",

Finally, the subjects in the experimental test group were examined for their attitudes toward the role and occupational  types to check for changes in attitudes from the first examinations.

He also cited \"body rhetoric\" (lawful protests or marches) and civil disobedience (illegal actions) as examples of irrational arguments. Haiman's statement on emotional appeals suggests a logic-emotion dichotomy, with reason and emotion at opposite ends of a continuum. However, logical argument and emotional appeal are, in fact, independent dimensions, and both must be considered for a comprehensive evaluation of argumentative proof. Organization, style, and language usage are not related to methods of reasoning or rationality, Also, body rhetoric or civil disobedience  (forms of nonverbal communication) are necessarily limited in presentation of proof, but the arguments they support are not necessarily irrational in themselves. Rational arguments are those that have sound, logical support for their claims, regardless of the verbal or nonverbal methods of presentation. (RN)",

The findings indicated that: most stations are run as undergraduate student activities, few stations are used for formal or informal training; most  stations carry commercial advertising, but few rely upon time sales for their main support; most stations rely upon institutional or student generated funds for their main support; programing consists mainly of recorded music; most stations afford little or no opportunity for student self-expression or news and public affairs programing; and most stations appear relatively free from institutional or outside controls but in most cases there appears to be little or no inclination to use this freedom innovatively.

However, the physical setting of the class, level of maturity and experience of the students, and overall instruction were changed as a result of the closing of the campus laboratory school. To accommodate the needs of the students adjustments, which include the following, were made: (1) more time was spent on general orientation, motivation, and visits to local high school speech and drama classes; (2) video tapes of students micro-teaching and role playing were critiqued with the pupils; and (3) the term projects required of the students focused on a resource unit or mini course which included teacher-made tests and evaluation sheets which were critiqued by the  class.

The imagery of violence, however, presents special problems. Upon encountering violence in the writing, the reader may experience what Leon Festinger terms &quot;cognitive dissonance.&quot; Festinger describes this situation as the result of a person's encounter with information that contradicts his experience or that he wants to avoid, creating a psychological imbalance. According to C. William Colburn, a persuasive message should offer some recommendation which, if accepted, will restore cognitive equilibrium. In much of her literature, Oates offers such recommendations or at least a moral resolution of the material. The indeterminate  quality of this resolution, however, demands sensitivity and imagination on the part of the reader. (LL)",

        "description":"Progress in realizing the full potential of computerized data processing is being hindered by costs and by the spread of a multitude of small, independent computer facilities. There is a need for some uniformity of specifications among the various systems. The result would be a compatibility that could help to reduce costs more rapidly because of the larger unit size. Such a uniformity would also provide the smallest and most remote district with access to the same wealth of data and services as it provides the largest urban area. This review surveys some of the many specific tasks that can be carried out by computers to assist school administrators in fulfilling their professional responsibilities. It examines the concept of regionalism in developing computer facilities and  suggests that such centers are ultimately more a boon than a threat to local personnel. It is control of the electronic data processing units within organizations, rather than merely the centralization of facilities, that presents the real issue to be faced. (Author)",

As a result, there is a gap between the power of the computer and some difficult administrative problems; e.g., longrange planning. However, there is increasing interest in the use of computer simulation in planning. PLANTRAN II represents a completely new approach away from former attempts to develop computer planning techniques. With this system, the decisionmakers can play an active role in the development of models with reduced dependence on technical staff. PLANTRAN II, which requires no technical expertise from the user, uses a simple language that is almost the same as the clerical instructions used in manual methods. This simple language is presented to a computer compiler that  translates the instructions into computer terms. The instructions are processed by the computer, and the results are presented in a format set by the user. This manual contains information not only on the uses of the system but also on planning in general. It has a programed instruction set on the PLANTRAN II language.

The workshop sessions made extensive use of computers.

Although the material in this manual exploits the capabilities of the PLANTRAN system, computer processing is not required for use of the models. Eight basic techniques of projecting enrollments are reviewed. These generalized techniques can be applied to any type of institution and to any type of enrollment. The crucial task is the matching of projection methods with the  objective of the projection effort, which requires the judgment of a knowledgeable administrator. (Author/WM)",

        "description":"Educational facilities have changed to accommodate changes in the provision of educational services. Today, educational facilities utilize innovative design concepts, new materials and finished surfaces, and sophisticated furniture and equipment. The full utilization of such facilities can easily suffer from a lack of adequate knowledge about them. Hence, orienting users to new facilities is a vital step in the completion of a school and the beginning of its use. This report addresses itself to this step and provides some guidelines in conducting a program of user orientation to new facilities. Case histories of two high schools, a junior high school, and an elementary school are cited as examples. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"The creation of Boards of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) was authorized in 1948 to function temporarily pending the creation of intermediate school districts. BOCES were viewed at their inception as a means to supplement teaching services and to provide a few nonacademic courses to school districts too small to provide their own. In succeeding years, because of the significant increase in the growth of BOCES, its seemingly new role as a permanent and integral part of the public secondary education system in New York State, and because of the expressed concern by citizens regarding its organization and financing, the need for an evaluation of the BOCES operations was created. A team studied the BOCES organizational framework, its administrative structure, the types of  services it offers, its financial structure, and its current role as an intermediate unit of secondary education. Study findings reveal in part that BOCES have become unique and powerful units of government with little or no public control; that neither the State nor component districts exercise adequate supervision over the programs and services; and that management and administrative services are not presently reviewed on the basis of need, cost, or performance. This report describes BOCES current operations, indicates the major findings, and presents the committee's recommendations. Six exhibits provide more specific data about the BOCES operation. (EA)",

Detailed data are given for the survey year 1969-70, as well as historical trend data for selected items of information. In some instances, data reach back to 1869-70. In addition, national enrollment figures are given for (1) elementary and secondary departments of institutions of higher education, (2) federally operated schools on federal installations, (3) federal schools for Indians, and (4) residential schools for exceptional children. Data are reported on a State-by-State basis. Initial tables provide a historical summary of public school  statistics; and data on school administrative units and State, local, and regional education agencies. Subsequent tables provide data on the number of school systems and public schools, the school age population, enrollment, average daily attendance, length of school term, grade enrollments, high school graduates, instructional staff, and the school lunch program. Concluding tables present data on financing public elementary and secondary school systems, including revenue and nonrevenue receipts for public schools, total expenditures, account balances on hand, current expenditures, capital outlay, interest on school debt, and expenditures per pupil.

It is seen by parents and children as an important alternative to the self-contained classroom concept of education. Its goals have centered on the continuing development of new roles for teachers; defining and disseminating the processes of developing an open school; and promoting students' awarness of the total environment, sense of exploration, and skill development. The ultimate goal has been to demonstrate that working with children in more open ways is an effective way of achieving skills and attitudes valued in our society. In attempting to summarize the  outcomes of the Project, this report deals both with the final project year under ESEA Title III, and with the total 3-year project period. References to the total project period are identified as such. The program has continued to change over the 3-year project period, responsive to needs of students and staff. These changes have been documented as they occurred. The program will continue to evolve as in the past, adjusting to continuation without the advantage of Title III funds.

It provides the missing theoretical base by explaining in comprehensive form the significance and purpose of the project. IGE/MUS-S is described in terms of its operation as a project in the Wisconsin Research and Development Center; its commitment to an IGE system that provides continuous progress towards mutually established goals; its primary analytical tool--a 3-part division of  the functions of education; its role in the ongoing process of change and innovation in education; problems that plague the educational process; and a set of 50 working statements on learning psychology. The paper also presents a general model for an alternative educational program, reviews current developments in the seven component areas that provide the focal points for the project, and discusses strategies and plans for implementation and future development.

Instead of shaping the students to fit the mold of the system, the system is being expanded to make allowances for individual differences. Alternative programs are another attempt by concerned educators to respond to the needs of individual students. In an effort to gain a picture of the extent of alternative education in the State of Washington and to help local districts avoid re-inventing the proverbial wheel, a survey was conducted during the 1971-72 school year wherein each public school district was asked to describe its alternative  education programs. In April of 1972, an Alternative Education Workshop was held in Issaquah, Washington, to discuss the problems inherent in the alternative education movement. This booklet provides excerpted comments from workshop participants and brief descriptions of the more than 200 alternative education programs offered in 95 of the State's public school districts as reported on the survey.

The second adaptation studies the role of volunteer activities in a school wherein a modified differentiated staffing plan is already in effect. The outcome of this study is a description of the roles or functions performed by the various levels of staffing, including volunteers. The third adaptation deals with a plan for increasing the  amount of volunteer help in an individualized reading program that led to a plan for vertical integration of classes.

A total of 151 formal half-day observations in 22 elementary classrooms were recorded. The most important conclusion of the study is that when volunteers were present, teachers allocated more of their own time to instructional functions. A selected bibliography is included.

The summary is intended to increase the level of awareness of school administrators who are involved with building programs. Since survey results indicated that the majority of schools utilize the traditional architect, contractor, and client relationship, the traditional method is evaluated here, and it s inadequacies as reported by school administrators are discussed. New techniques developed to overcome the stresses and inadequacies of the traditional procedure are listed. Among these techniques, the design/build method is recommended to best fulfill the objectives for improved building programs in  independent schools. The design/build technique is defined, two examples of the technique in operation are provided, a model design/build project for an independent school is suggested, and the advantages and disadvantages of this method are offered.

The author traces the historical development of the State's role in urban education and makes suggestions for its future role. He urges increased State support for urban schools, outlines the manner in which that support should be given, and suggests a metropolitan organizational structure to handle urban educational needs.

Principals have an important responsibility in the leadership and direction of such employees. Principals have a critical role to play in ensuring that educational public policy is not determined at a collective bargaining table--they are the key people in this overall bargaining process. Principals are playing an increasingly important role in the financial management of education, including decisionmaking as to program priorities. Principals will ultimately exercise much greater discretion in determining how to reach educational objectives providing they assume their proper role of responsibility for much of  educational leadership.

        "description":"In the spring of 1973, a standardized test of reading and mathematics skills was administered to 564 grade 3 pupils distributed among two open plan schools (155 pupils) and seven conventionally constructed schools (409 pupils). The groups were matched on IQ, geographic location, the academic qualifications of their teachers, and average class load. This was the third and final year of a longitudinal ability and achievement study of this pupil cohort. As in the previous two years, the marginal differences in achievement as disclosed by test results were neither consistent nor significant. Over the three schools years, beginning in September 1970, no significant differences were found in the academic ability and scholastic achievement levels between the pupils in the two sorts of  architectural settings. No consistent patterns were discernible; some differences might be attributable to factors other than architecture, since it was impossible to control all the variables (e.g., years of teaching experience) that might reasonably have affected the learning situations under study.

Education contains both investment and consumption aspects. The analysis shows that the only distortion resulting from uncertainty arises because information is a public good whose supply should be increased: there need be no distortion attributable to \"capital market imperfections\"; all else being equal, current tax laws encourage relatively too much educational investment in human capital. Additionally, the educational services market is in disequilibrium because the education boom of the 1960s left it with a large fixed investment in buildings and many tenured  teachers; a mother's education importantly affects her children's future success, the father's less so, but the present value of this future intergenerational transfer is small. Tentative conclusions indicate an increase in social subsidy of education is justified and should be directed to grade schools. An 18-item bibliography is included. (Author)",

Because of this unique ordering, no substitution effects are possible, and the income effects are constrained and influence the demand for only one good or factor. It appears possible to observe a relative decrease in the demand for the \"favored\" good or factor, even though both goods are normal or both factors have positive marginal products. If this model accurately reflects the preference ordering for local public school administrators, a standard economic analysis of the current crises in the teacher labor market could yield inappropriate conclusions regarding the  adjustment process on the demand side.

The surveying experience on which this book is based is confined to systematically selected samples of 384 from specific populations. This means that 95 times in 100 a characteristic of the population occurs within plus-or-minus 5 percent of the times it occurs as a characteristic in the sample. Telephone interviewing is used  with trained volunteer surveyors. When \"captive populations\" such as students or staff are surveyed, written questionnaires preferably are used, in conjunction with optically scannable answer sheets. The volunteer interviewer is not recommended for face-to-face interviewing because of the tendency toward bias. The commitment of the volunteer is less likely to influence the respondent if the exposure is over the telephone and is brief. (Author)",

Major findings include: no apparent relationship between a teacher's rate of absence and his performance rating, the rate of discretionary absence is generally twice as high as the rate for illnesses requiring a medical certificate, teacher discretionary absence rates are approximately 21 percent higher for Mondays and Fridays than for  other school days, discretionary absence rates are 29 percent higher in Title I elementary schools than in other elementary schools, and those schools with a higher percentage of teachers with more than five years service show a higher absence rate from illnesses requiring medical certificates.

It is designed as a tool to improve local school management and to raise the level of dialogue between school officials and the public. Since it may be misleading to compare the performance of every school in a large system, those schools with similar student populations are grouped into categories. The author describes what a classification system is and how it will operate, and offers some examples of specific status variables that might be used to assign schools to categories. An illustrative list of measure of student performance (based on available or readily obtainable data) is described, together with the limitations  and difficulties of such a classification-rating system. A social-economic occupational rating scale and a 27-item bibliography are included. (Author)",

It understands its duty to deliberate and reach decisions regarding the educational needs of the community, the best use of available resources, the adoption of policies and programs which will secure an opportunity of great personal advantage to the youth of the community and, at the same time, protect the State from the consequences of an ignorant and incompetent citizenry. Frequently, school board members, either by choice or because of failure to be reelected, have a relatively short stay in office. This high rate of \"turnover\" thrusts great responsibilities on those who may not always see clearly the consequences of some important decision. This handbook is designed to ease the transitional  period by highlighting what a new school board member in New Hampshire needs to know. Described are needed skills in negotiations, decisionmaking, goal-setting, needs assessment, communications, and community relations. Experienced committeemen should also find the information useful for those new and unexpected problems that constantly arise. (Author)",

        "description":"An essential prerequisite to reform of present methods of financing elementary and secondary schools and the development of an equitable, adequate, and workable system of school finance is a precise understanding of how the existing system works and its impact on different school districts and population groups. This report documents the existing revenue and expenditure patterns in Illinois and examines the fiscal impact of the current system, the nature and extent of disparities among districts, and the factors that contribute to the disparities. An attempt is made to distinguish the degree to which disparities among districts can be attributed to differences in educational resources and services and differences in prices or wages for equivalent services. Wide disparities in per  pupil spending in the unit school districts of Illinois are described according to 1970-71 data. The differences are traced back to the State's revenue system and to the dominant role that the local property tax plays in school finance. This role, in turn, necessitates directing attention to the differences in per pupil property value from district to district, which differences are documented by the authors. State support modifies somewhat but fails to eliminate completely the revenue differentials. The authors show how the tax burdens of school support differ for persons of various income levels, with the poor paying relatively higher percentages of their income. Numerous illustrative tables and figures are provided. (Author/DN)",

Modern educational programs emphasize the discovery approach to learning where pupils do more than just read about the world around them. For example, they become active explorers and participate in discovering nature and how best to enjoy it and care for it. Thus, there is a curricular use for a site. Every part of the school program can involve some activity in the out-of-doors. Consequently, any consideration of the need for and design of educational facilities must, by necessity, include a careful analysis of the site, including its selection, development, and planned utilization. This bulletin is written to assist school administrators, local boards of education, planning consultants, and school architects in that  process. Specific guidelines are offered with regard to desirable sites and their characteristics of size, shape, topography, subsurface conditions, surrounding conditions, and location. Suggestions are offered to alleviate the limitations of inadequate sites, where the financial problems of land purchase require alternate solutions. The importance of planning to protect and enhance the environment is cited, several types and sources of information useful in site selection are listed, and a selected bibliography is provided.

Accordingly, it behooves school officials to develop and implement comprehensive public land use policies applicable to the enhancement of the public school site.

        "description":"First, the author discusses a major issue, that of school size within the context of the existing theory of scalar economies. He describes expenditures per student for the school as a function of the quality of educational services provided by the school and the number of students in the school. He reviews some studies that considered the impact of school size on various aspects of school quality -- where school quality is defined as some weighted combination of school outputs. The author finds school size to have negative or no impact on achievement test scores and negative effect on a selected set of affective outcomes. Examination of the data on difference in school size between public and private schools reveals that public schools may be too large to operate at the minimum  level of expenditure required for a given level of quality. Another major issue discussed concerns the implications of the theory and evidence of school size for educational voucher plans. The author suggests that pressures of competition would encourage firms to operate within the range of optimal school size. Since the minimum efficient size of a school would be relatively small, he suggests that potential competition would also be a real force in the market. The essence of this discussion is that the smaller the size of each individual school in the market for educational services, the greater the number of schools, the extent of competition, and, hence, the efficiency with which educational services will be produced.

The report begins with brief treatments of the socioeconomic environment and political culture in which education takes place. State governmental arrangements for public school policymaking are then described. Next, recent State policy decisions in four educational issue areas are reviewed to illustrate the operation of the system. Following this review, the essential roles, relationships, and perceptions of the different actors are analyzed. An interpretation of the policymaking process concludes the case study. The data for this case study were derived from interviews, questionnaires, documents, and  secondary sources. The research took place during 1972-73. (Author)",

The social, economic, and political context is described since it provides a backdrop from which to view the structure of State government and education. The enduring pattern of State educational politics, as reflected by other studies of New York, are summarized; and action or attempted action in each of four major State educational policy issue areas are described. For the most part, the issue areas--school finance, desegregation of schools, teacher certification, and educational program improvement--provide a means of looking at educational policymaking at the State level. Analysis of both the policy issue areas and the policy  process serves to explain, in greater detail, the process of educational governance. Some important and larger themes are discussed as illustrated by the analysis, and interpretive comments about emerging roles and relationships in the governance of education in New York State are presented.

The report is designed to serve as a resource for those involved in evaluating present school district and school organization structure and in planning to improve education through the development of stronger, more effective educational administrative units and attendance centers. The findings should be of equal interest to educators, school board members, government officials, parents, and other electors interested in improving education. Following an initial narrative report on research in educational planning, twelve summary tables of research findings  are provided. These tables offer data on factors related to elementary, junior, and senior high schools; comparative findings between high school size and (1) pupil achievement, (2) per pupil costs, (3) curricular offerings, (4) staff qualifications, (5) extracurricular programs, and (6) miscellaneous factors; factors related to school size in general; educational administrative unit size; and State enrollment guidelines for administrative units.

This interest has prompted the preparation of a bibliography on various aspects of the debate. The first part of this listing represents a selection of material on those Canadian provinces that have been involved for some time or that are about to become involved in various aspects of the credit system. The next section includes materials that trace briefly the development of the credit system in Ontario, particularly in terms of its implementation in the initial six schools and presents selections that discuss the many issues aired in the controversy. The final group of citations present a variety of approaches to some of  the questions and criticisms most frequently voiced in the literature covered in the previous section. The literature search emphasizes Canadian material from 1967 to early 1974. American material from 1970 to the present has also been searched and, whenever appropriate, has been included in the last section. The citations are listed in each section under the headings: books, research reports, theses, pamphlets, journal articles, and videotapes. Those items available from the ERIC Document Reproduction Service are so indicated. (Compiler/EA)",

The data are derived from the U.S. Office of Education's Survey of Equal Opportunity for the school year 1965-66. Evidence relating teacher characteristics to student achievement is combined with data on the costs of obtaining teachers with different characteristics. This evaluation suggests that recruiting and retaining teachers with higher verbal scores is five to ten times as effective per dollar of teacher expenditure in raising achievement scores of students as the strategy of obtaining teachers with more experience. Separate estimates are made for black and for white 6th graders in schools of the metropolitan North. (Author)",

        "description":"At present, the section of Buffalo in which the majority of the residents are white carries most of the burden of the K-8 schools with their extremely limited seventh and eight grade offerings. The sections of the community in which the majority of the residents are black now carry the heavy burdens of teacher shortage and teacher turnover that result in lower educational achievement. All the schools suffer from lack of even the most fundamental equipment such as books, dictionaries, globes, and maps. The Middle School Complexes can provide a solution that will cost substantially less than simply replacing the existing old buildings at their present locations. The Complex concept also opens up a new potential for a much higher quality of education available to all children on the  basis of real equality and without segregation. Each Complex would belong to a larger community as a whole, responsive to and responsible to that total community. This study attempts to plan locations, attendance areas, and organizations for middle schools to make it feasible for the Board of Education in Buffalo to eliminate racial imbalance, progressively, at least from the fifth grade on. Ways to meet this goal are described within the context of the severe plant obsolescence problem and the urgent need to provide ways of improving the quality of schooling at every grade level for every pupil.

The publication overviews the general aspects of 45-15, considering the basic concept and its origin, general implementation, how the plan compares with other year-round school calendars, and its efficiency and flexibility. The implications of 45-15 on curriculum, community, students, teachers, finance, and legislation are discussed. Student evaluation under the 45-15 plan is considered, and sample progress reports are included. The document outlines the 45-15 scheduling procedure and the multiple access scheduling; including discussions on establishing the course catalog, student  and teacher assignments, calendar selection, the scheduling process, and student transportation.

The report begins with brief treatments of the socioeconomic environment and political culture within which education takes place. State governmental arrangements for public school policy are described, and four educational issues are reviewed to illustrate the operation of the system. Issues examined include school finance, competency-based certification, desegregation, and regional education service centers. Following these discussions, the essential relationship among and perceptions of the different actors -- legislature, governor, State Commissioner, State Board of Education, Texas Education Agency, special interest groups -- are analyzed.  An interpretation of the policymaking process and the roles of those who participate concludes the case study. (Author/DN)",

It was hypothesized that LD children would have a basal age no more than two levels below chronological age; that LD children would show a test scatter ranging over at least four levels of the test; that LD children would have particular difficulty with items involving memory, concentration, visual motor, judgment, and reasoning skills; and that LD children would show behaviors indicative of hyperactivity, distractibility, short attention span, or impulsivity during the testing procedure. It was found that 20% of the children had basal  scores at 2-years below age level, a figure in line with estimates of the incidence of LD children. Test scatter ranging over 4 levels was found for all the normal preschool children indicating test scatter is not of diagnostic value. In addition, no children failed on visual-motor items, and the 40% of the sample who failed on items of judgment, reasoning, memory, and concentration had social backgrounds which might account for the difficulty. Behavioral symptoms during testing did not distinguish the LD child from the immature or emotionally disturbed child. It was concluded that early predictive identification of LD children is not presently possible, and that a child with a potential learning disability should not be labeled or removed from the regular classroom.

The planning stage is seen to involve product clearance, copyrighted material releases, talent releases, and actual material design for instructional and cost effectiveness. The production of instructional materials is discussed in terms of technical considerations (such as print or audiovisual formats), preparing  materials for effective use, preparing materials for delivery, and legal considerations such as copyright and royalties. Briefly considered are approaches to assessing the technical aspects and the instructional effectiveness of the materials.

Both group and individual activities are suggested for the following four categories: activities in which both child and sound are stationary, activities in which the child is stationary but the sound is moving, activities in which the child is moving and sound is stationary, and activities in which both child and sound source are moving. It is explained that the manual is the result of a survey of orientation and mobility specialists and classroom teachers which found a paucity of relevant information on localization training. Recommended is the use of the Portable Audible Goal Locator (PAGL) as a controllable sound source for training activities. Preliminary  activities deal with familiarization with the PAGL device such as locating parts of the device. Examples of group activities include determining whether the speaker is facing away from or toward the listener, pointing to the sound source, and utilizing the sound source to demonstrate the movement of the moon (sound source) around the earth (student). Provided for the student with observable needs in the area of sound localization are individualized activities such as determining relative distance of sound source, localizing sound in relation to sides of the body, facing the sound source, and tracking a sound source by moving the entire body.

        "description":"Discussed are the effects of parental attitudes on the early development of the congenitally blind child. The disproportion between family reactions and the limitations of the handicap are attributed to symbolic aspects of blindness and previously existing pathological elements in the parents. Compared are developmental milestones (such as the year's delay in establishing J. Piaget's concept of object permanence) of young blind and seeing children. Stressed is the importance for emotional health of the 4- or 5-year-old blind child's recognizing and verbalizing his blindness. The author reports on his examination of over 500 blind children under 6 years of age which involved a scale of development and an interview with the parents (usually the mother). It is concluded that one  third of the children are relatively normal and come from accepting homes (more than half of these children have some useful vision); that another group of children with high verbal skills but low autonomy, sensory-motor, and sociability skills have mothers who are nonrejecting but overprotective due to lack of information; that a third group with high autonomy but low sociability, language and sensory-motor scores typically have mothers who were never able to overcome initial depression and rejection; and that a final group with very low overall development appear to have suffered severe affective deprivation. It is stressed that a blind child's upbringing requires greater virtues in the mother than does the normal child's upbringing. Appended are two scales of development for preschool  blind children.

It is stressed that the philosophy of the middle schools and of team teaching is to provide a means of meeting individual needs of students. Described are the program's physical facilities (one large and two small classrooms), qualifications of five team members, the student population (97% black), and curriculum development. Explained are goals and objectives in the area of self concept, social relations, and academics. Reported are results of program evaluation showing that growth in the areas of reading and arithmetic matched the time lapse between test administrations, and that important positive  behavioral changes were observed in student attitudes, independence and pride in work, peer relationships, and self control. A final section focuses on the instructional process of the teaming program in terms of variables (such as the need for peer group acceptance), staff, and program scheduling and policies. Also discussed is the process of developing individual educators to become cooperating team members. Recommendations are given in the areas of personnel selection, classroom management, curriculum, and physical space. Appended are a questionnaire, a teacher evaluation form, and a lesson plan form.

Products received were assigned to one of the following categories: dissemination, field-testing, further prototype development, and rejection. Products for the hearing impaired, educable and trainable mentally retarded, learning disabled, or preschool children were included. Evaluators of the materials represented the disability areas and subject matter areas of  the materials. The National Center selected 14 materials for further consideration and provided material name, media, disability, and source.

Provided are statistical data on the general project, budget, pupil population, program staff, (more than 200 teachers on a part time basis), number of participants and estimated costs, and the budget summary. The program is seen to serve special needs of the gifted and talented such as the need to be actively involved in activities that are personally satisfying. The program is said to be unique due to a broader definition of giftedness, the aspect of student-initiation, location of activities within the community, and timing of activities to  include both school and non-school hours. Noted are demographic factors and non-public schools in the area. Listed are personnel and procedures involved in planning of the program. Program content and procedures are discussed in terms of antecedents (such as identification of target students), activities and transactions (such as procedures students follow to apply for a special project and progress monitoring), objectives and intended outcomes (such as 90% of students expressing a desire to continue work in the area of the project), a summary of evaluation of design, and provisions for dissemination of program information. Project management is covered in an appended chart of critical tasks and target dates. Noted are financial efforts to phase out federal support for the program.

Center objectives include identification from longitudinal data of school children with inadequate communication skills. The Center's research is conducted under Program I, concerned with development and evaluation of early communication systems for handicapped children, and under Program II, concerned with improvement of handicapped children's performance through training in language skills (kindergarten and early elementary grades). Program I projects center on communication skill in Down's Syndrome children, evaluation of  preschool programs to develop communication skills in deaf children, morphological development of deaf children with deaf parents, receptive language development of deaf children using rebus and sign language, identification of children with potential communication handicaps, and verbal/nonverbal help-seeking behavior in mentally retarded (MR) children. Program II projects encompass verbal elaboration and word recognition comprehension skills of young MR children, and vocabulary development improvement in reading through self instruction and efficient information processing. The Center functions as a university component guided by a director, research and policy committees who oversee facilities, the special education instructional improvement laboratory, and personnel including staff  members and junior scientists.

To aid in the identification of handicapped children, definitions of the following conditions are given: trainable mentally retarded, educable mentally retarded, severely emotionally disturbed, hearing impaired, visually impaired, physically handicapped, speech impaired, neurologically impaired, and learning disabled. The roles of the state, the local school district, and parents in the proposed advocacy system are  explained. Cooperative board and large cities are encouraged to provide programs which cannot be supported efficiently at the local level. Delineated are state education department responsibilities such as maintaining handicapped pupil registers. It is proposed that the state assume all costs in excess of average local costs on a per pupil basis. Recommended is legislation regarding legal responsibility for education of handicapped children, and construction of all new schools to conform to the requirements of children with handicapping conditions.

Discussed is a rationale for the approach which posits that poor and/or nonwhite children do not have equal access to school-preparatory experiences though they may exhibit adequate adaptive behavior in their nonschool environment. It is explained that if intelligence is the ability to profit from experience then the test-train-retest approach allows the child to perform at his optimum level by familiarizing him with test contents thus increasing his sense of competence. It is suggested that improvement following training indicates learning competence on reasoning tasks, and that learning  potential assessment should be differentially effective with children from different socio-economic backgrounds and tested IQs. Research is reported which corroborates these hypotheses. Also discussed are two learning potential assessment instruments, the Kohs Block Designs and the Raven Progressive Matrices. Stressed during the training sessions is teaching the principles involved in problem solution. It is recommended that assessment of learning potential lead to pinpointing cognitive processes which need remediation followed by appropriate remedial instruction. (DB)",

In phase I the Ss named 18 picture pairs appearing on a screen, then named missing pictures during four trials (scoring was on the basis of correct responses per trial). In phase II, two groups were developed by comparing the Ss' performances on the last pretest trial, ranking the Ss within each group, and assigning the Ss randomly to the training or practice  condition. During four trials training condition Ss used a memory \"trick\" (such as remembering \"hook\" and \"glove\" with a sentence \"the glove got caught on the hook\"). The practice condition Ss simulated the pretest phase pattern during the four trials. In phase III, a posttest two weeks later, all Ss were tested with the pretest pattern for four trials. Results showed that the performance of the EMR Ss was poorest, performance of MA controls was intermediary, and performance of CA controls was best; that for the practice condition all groups improved across trials though the relative position of the groups remained constant; and that for the training condition the three groups maintained the relative positions though all groups improved during training and declined on the posttest.  Subsequent reminder of the \"trick\" during a posttraining phase produced marked improvement across groups. (MC)",

The Ss were assigned to the following four groups (12 Ss in each group): the communication control group, the LP trained condition group, the communication trained condition group, and the LP control condition group. Training was by paired subjects during six 1/2-hour sessions twice per week and involved increasingly complex tasks in areas of perceptual discrimination, cognitive classification, language, and roletaking. Tasks incorporated concrete stimuli  and required procedural verbal analysis such as describing a picture in an array for a listener. A final task required the S to be the trainer, to explain the rules, and to guide adults through an exercise. Results showed that the communication trained group had higher mean scores than the LP trained group and the communication control group on communication skills and specific skills of perception and cognition. Also, the findings showed that communication training was effective in improving performance on the RPM even when no intervening RPM training was offered. (MC)",

The 12 behaviors included attention, distraction, self-stimulation, aggressive behavior to and from peer, positive and negative verbal response to peer, and positive and negative verbal response from peer. Sociometric questionnaires were administered to all the Ss and were scored on the basis of percentage of peer knowing student, times  student was chosen as a friend, \"alright\" responses, and \"not liked\" responses. Results partially confirmed the view held by special educators that EMR children are rejected because they engage in inappropriate behavior. A significant relationship was found to exist between social status and verbally aggressive behavior though physically aggressive behavior was not related to social status. The same relationship between verbal aggression and social rejection was found for the mentally typical children. The results implied that the social position of EMR children could be improved by reducing the incidence of verbally abusive behavior. (MC)",

The learning procedure involved three administrations of 16 test and five coaching designs prior to coaching and 1 month following coaching. Ss were considered gainers whose pre to posttest four designs score change was more than nongainers (whose pre-to posttest score change was less than four designs), and high scorers (who solved a difficult block problem in upper level of test during pretest). Results indicated that SC Ss tended to report spending free time with families rather than friends, that  both groups reported being given responsible roles at home, and that RC Ss tended to report more responsibility in the home. Also findings showed that nongainers reported themselves most alienated from their parents, desired increased physical contacts, and did not desire verbal interactions; that high scorers and gainers to a lesser degree reported spending free time outside the family though they had good relations with their families, that high scorers reported having good relation with their fathers; and that gainers reported good relations with their mothers and desired better relations with their fathers. The data provided further support for the finding that the more able SC students by the learning potential assessment probably severely educationally retarded; also, data showed  that nongainers evidenced the alienation and immaturity in family relations ascribed to the mentally retarded.

The association task required an S to give up to 25 associations for each of 10 verbal stimuli. The associations were scored for quantity and speed of response, and were categorized by a modification of J. Flavell's system for measuring response quality. The two groups differed in vocabulary size, as expected. When the association data was corrected by vocabulary size, relatively few differences between EMR and non-EMR Ss remained. Data showed that the EMR Ss were slower in the first and continuing response(s) to the  association stimuli, used fewer logical associations, and used fewer responses with vocational connotations. After adjustment for vocabulary differences in the two groups differed only on five of the 24 measures examined, thus showing comparable associative networks. Other differences demonstrated a specific deficit of EMR Ss in logical connections and in speed of access to the associative net. (Author)",

System I involves a random access tape recorder, a printed or braille dictionary which contains the inquiry numbers for words, a console (similar to an adding machine) on which the number is punched, and a microphone through which the word is spoken after being automatically searched. A major limitation of System I is the chance for student error. System II uses a magnetic card reader (similar to the Language Master). A sighted student searches for a word in the card reader, removes the card, and places it on the play-back device, which sounds the word from the tape recorded strip at the card's lower edge. Shortcomings of System II  include a bulky card file and need for the card's return to the correct alphabetical position. Advantages include teacher selection of a word list for student use as well as low cost. System III is essentially an automated version of System II, however the search for the correct card and maintenance of the card file are handled by automatic card-sort equipment. The only requirement for System III is sufficient student coordination to punch into a search card and insert the card into the inquiry console. System III is fast, accurate, and expensive. (MC)",

Irvin Schloss discussed how the American Foundation for the Blind functions to favorably influence policymakers and legislators in the executive, judiciary, and  legislative branches of the federal government. Speaking for the state level, Norm Silver makes practical suggestions such as joining an organization for the deaf to obtain desired laws. Henry Warner considers the Social Security Amendments of 1972 in terms of social services, the supplemental security income program, medicaid, vocational rehabilitation, and implications for deaf persons. J. Sugarman, describes welfare provisions as they pertain to the federal supplemental security income program, assistance standards, state options, eligibility verification, and political compromise.

        "description":"National estimates on physical health status, health problems, or abnormal conditions of approximately 13,887 noninstitutionalized American children, 6 to 11 years of age in 1963 through 1965, and adolescents, 12 to 17 years of age in 1966 through 1970, were derived from pediatric examinations in the National Health Examination survey and from parent ratings of children's present and past medical history. The two surveys involved samples of children and adolescents representative of the population with respect to such characteristics as age, sex, race, region, and size of place of residence. Major findings showed that parents considered 52% of the children (earlier survey) and 67% of the adolescents (later survey) to be in very good health; that pediatricians found only one of  eight children to have one or more significant problems (such as cardiovascular or physical abnormality) compared with one youth in five for the older group; that serious accidents increased with consistent significance with increased age; that approximately 4% of both groups had hearing problems; and that 7% of the youths (slightly higher in the younger groups) had vision problems. Additional major findings indicated that Negro children and youths more frequently were found to be in the abnormal range than their white counterparts; that children in the West were less and children in the South were more frequently abnormal than children elsewhere; and that the proportion of abnormal conditions in children decreased consistently as family income level increased.

The program is described as involving initial identification of the handicapped child, residence for 1 week by the family (at no cost) in a demonstration home in Anchorage at which time parents are instructed in ways to stimulate language development as a part of daily life, home visits, and teacher training. Discussed are program objectives (such as increase in language stimulation through home activities), functions and suggestions for staff members, and facility requirements. Provided in the section on identification and planning are a list of agencies to contact, and referral forms. Outlined is the one week program at the demonstration  home. Included are ways to bring in language, a list of recommended toys, recommended content for teacher discussions with parents, forms for recording receptive and expressive language evaluation, and a yearly report form. Also outlined are guidelines for the home visits (at 3-month intervals). Guidelines for the family education aide, a listing of appropriate media materials, and sample idea sheets which illustrate teaching techniques for parent use are given, Samples are also provided of a total communication handbook (with illustrations of eskimo life style) and forms for use of video tapes. Program staff are seen to serve a community resource in rural areas. A final section notes teacher training functions of the program and lists reference articles suitable for parents on file with  the program. (DB)",

Stressed is the importance of driver education for residents able to leave the institution. The philosophy of the program is given to emphasize individualizing instruction, instructing students who possess the potential for driving, discouraging students who lack the ability to drive, and teaching appropriate pedestrian safety, vehicle passenger safety, and bicycle safety procedures. Recommended is a well qualified instructor and equipment such as the driving simulator, a car, and audiovisual aids. Differentiated are the three courses offered: the Advanced Course of Driver Education consisting of classroom discussion and drills, simulator instruction, and in-car  driving experience; the Basic Course of Driver Education using the same material and equipment but slanted toward the negative aspects of driving to encourage students to decide against driving; and Pedestrian and Vehicle Passenger Safety for slower learning students. Noted is the addition of a class in bicycle and two-wheeler motor vehicle safety. Instruction is explained to involve from 30 to 60 hours of classroom instruction and 10 to 60 hours of in-car driving experience. The major portion of the document outlines the following topics: teaching methods, introduction of driver education to the students, the traffic accident, the driver, the car, the laws of nature and man, road signs, car nameuvers, driving in adverse conditions and emergencies, the driver's manual, and in-car driving.

Intelligence levels followed the average distribution curve. Twelve percent of the children showed symptoms of emotional decompensation, while 25% were considered well adjusted, and the remaining 66% showed mild or moderate symptoms of emotional stress. Seventy to eighty percent of the children had difficulty with finger-gnossis, right-left discrimination, and synkinesis in the neurological examination. The intervention group  was selected by the following criteria: presence of perceptual deviations in spatial and temporal organization, evidence that cerebral dominance for language was not yet established, and poor fine motor coordination. The intervention group tended to cluster in the lower socioeconomic groups; to show some degree of psychiatric impairment and to have low initial reading scores. Readministration of educational tests at the end of the first grade revealed that the children in the intervention group were indistinguishable in their reading achievement from the total first grade. The study indicated the effectiveness of integrating the skills of a medical center with those of the public schools. The study was replicated the following year with similar findings. (DB)",

Included is a brief general discussion of the language system--phonology, morphology, and syntax--followed by examples illustrating the  distinctive features of the French language in each of these areas. Particular attention is paid to the verbal system. Suggestions are made for classroom application and strategy. \"In the foreign language classroom the presentation of material should encourage the formation of rules for the whole system of the language rather than the memorization of items.

        "description":"In forming a theory of communicative interaction between human beings it is necessary to consider some general features implicit in the communicative process. These include the context of situation, philosophical categories, psycholinguistic categories, grammatical categories, and nonverbal categories. Most of these are extra-linguistic and have to do with the social contexts or conceptual conditions. Language and nonverbal acts operate together in a synchronized, coordinated way in human communication. Understanding of the nonverbal input into the speech act will contribute to understanding of the meaning of the speech act. Of particular interest is the context of situation, which comprises the why, how, when, where, who with, what, and under what circumstances. This involves  the choice of channel of communication, such as acoustical, optical, tactual, or chemical; the temporal element and the time duration; the location and the space/distance relationship; the description and relationships of the speaker-hearer, as well as the non-participants, or the audience in the surroundings; the physical condition of the surroundings--amount of light, noise, silence, and artifacts; the zeitgeist in which the society finds itself; the individual idiosyncratic condition of the participants; and, finally, the style of communication in the medium and the genre used. The context of situation affects profoundly and with controlling influence the choices in language, from pronunciation features to syntax, larger structures, and nonverbal behavior. An analysis without these  considerations could only be done in an extremely narrow sense, and this might be almost useless with regard to meaning. (Author/HW)",

        "description":"This paper examines the possibility of establishing a threshold level for the projected European units/credits system for modern languages in adult education. By threshold level is understood \"a basic level of foreign language proficiency the level below which no further levels could be usefully distinguished.\" It is concluded that the height of the threshold level cannot be determined on the basis of minimum language needs, because there is no such thing as a more or less definable minimum. The criterion ultimately chosen was that of estimated average study time. The threshold level defined is, in fact, the general proficiency level which the average European adult learner is expected to be able to reach in a year's time, given the availability of adequate language learning  facilities. The criterion for the content of this level was based on the estimated usefulness for the majority of adult language learners in the majority of everyday situations. A more appropriate name for the level thus described (rather than threshold level) might be \"first general proficiency level.\" (Author)",

        "description":"If we adopt an approach to language teaching which is closely based on the learner's specific needs and shortens the period that may elapse between the beginning of language study and the first time the learner can put his newly acquired knowledge into practice, we not only motivate existing learners to work harder and learn more but may also encourage people to begin foreign language learning who would never have considered it before. We can imagine a system which does not only divide up the whole of the language into those parts which are essential for learners of different occupations or with different needs, but which takes any one of those parts and divides it further into parts relevant only for specific operations found on a given job. We must then show how these parts are  interrelated and guide the learner to suitable learning sequences, while, at the same time, maximizing his freedom of choice. Included here are a consideration of various hotel staff functions and, in particular, the writing of hotel correspondence and the waiter function. The paper finally focuses on one of the operations that constitute the waiter function, namely the understanding of orders and the vocabulary required for it. (Author)",

Included are a discussion of the rationale for such a system, the aims of its planners, the language learning objectives to be established for the courses, means for individualizing the program to meet the needs of each adult learner, and linguistic theory as related to the instruction of modern languages to adults. By units/credits system is understood a study framework in which a given subject matter is articulated into elements which can be grouped in different ways by different classes of learners in accordance with their needs and interests. Intelligent choice is then possible, and can perhaps be encouraged by recognizing some coherent combinations of elements  as constituting \"units\" of study. Where the mastery of such a unit is relevant to the acquisition of some formal qualification, \"credits\" can be awarded. A system of this kind appears to offer a promising framework for guidance combined with freedom and flexibility in the, at present, badly unstructured field of adult education. (Author/HW)",

Determination of these needs for each student presents a problem of research and analysis. Considered here are: (1) types of needs: objective, subjective, and educational; (2) levels of analysis: general needs, specific needs, or particular  needs; (3) scales adopted for the interpretation of the analysis: determination of needs, analysis of needs, and adequacy of need fulfillment; and (4) types of analysis: content analysis, empirical analysis, and surveys of opinion.

        "description":"Every individual's needs will differ, and a unit/credit system must be designed with sufficient flexibility to ensure that whatever the individual's interest in language learning, the system caters to it. The thesis of this paper is that, while a grammatical approach to language teaching cannot cater to it, a communicative approach can. A communicative approach asks essentially two questions: What are the types of language interaction in which the individual is going to engage and with what purpose? This goes beyond asking what the situations are in which the individual will find himself needing the language, although situational dimensions are important. Whereas the grammatical approach derives a teaching program from the form that utterances have in a particular language, the  communicative approach is concerned essentially with the content of utterances. The paper further discusses the value and advisability of considering this approach when formulating a syllabus. (Author)",

The conditions were: printed SS, SN, NS, NN, and auditory SS, SN, NS, NN (S=standard, N=nonstandard). An analysis of variance within groups with certain planned comparisons was carried out. A linear trend was also applied to the data. The results revealed four out of ten planned comparisons to be significant. The NN printed  condition facilitated learning more than any other condition. The NN condition collapsed across sensory modes (printed and auditory) was found to facilitate retention more than any other collapsed combination. (Author)",

Understanding how these creative forces operate leads to an explanation of linguistic diversity within the framework of universals.

However, although it has been found that inducement of grammatical consciousness is not necessarily a pedagogical liability, its worth depends to a large extent upon the kinds of facts to be made known and the way in which they are presented. Specific examples of this are presented. While admitting the pedagogical validity of grammar study, it is neither necessary nor desirable to exclude attention to pragmatics; syntax and pragmatics can work in effective harmony. That the student wants to use the language to communicate and that the teacher needs to draw attention to certain structures are not irreconcilable facts. What the  student \"wants to say\" can, in many ways, actually be controlled from outside, i.e., by the teacher, with the aid of proper materials. Such materials would include presupposition-based exercises prescribed not so much by prior stipulation as by the very content of the communication upon which the exercise is built. Specific examples of such exercises are given. (Author)",

A better understanding and more knowledge might be had by including static and declining countries and areas and by the study of special fields which can be called the parameters of &quot;language ecology.&quot; The ecology of a language would comprise, in addition to an assessment of institutional support, facts about its classification, speakers, domains of use, internal varieties, written traditions, standardization, and the attitudes of its users toward it and concurrent languages. Such ecological typology would necessitate the  study of language policy and linguistics, demography, sociology, dialectology, philology, prescriptivism, lexicography, ethnolinguistics, and dialinguistics. We need to search for basic principles and concepts of these studies which can be used to arm the English teacher against ignorance, particularly since personality can hardly be separated from language--the key to culture and to learning.

Physical movement during training was not shown to be a critical factor in achievement. However, the experiment revealed a significant difference in student attitudes toward the techniques, indicating that motivation is weak when students learn in an inert way; it is preferable to have them make a physical response to the foreign commands. In addition, the inactive observers engaged in a significantly higher amount of silent translation during the training than students in motion, who make direct associations between the acoustic image and its meaning. A total physical response  approach in order to develop listening fluency has proved very effective. However, there are some hurdles in the use of this technique in regular classroom situations where it might be difficult for fifteen or more students to move simultaneously around the room, or where people of different cultures feel reluctant and uncomfortable doing so.

        "description":"This paper makes a case for bi-culturative education as part of English-as-a-second-language programs. This calls for systematically teaching alternatives to the native cultural patterns which are acceptable in American society. Knowledge and practice of specific cultural interference patterns would enable the learner to function adequately in two cultural contexts and, at the same time, to choose freely between behavioral alternatives. Cultural context in this case refers to learning the typical American culture patterns and includes such potential points of conflict as the expression of an inappropriate thought, the use of an inappropriate gesture, the choice of an inappropriate term, the practice of inappropriate behavior, or the manifestation of an inappropriate reaction.  Space-time orientation is proposed as a new approach to the interpretation and teaching of cross-cultural differences in the classroom. It can be shown, for example, how this orientation varies among the American, the French, and the Hispanic cultures. It is vital in implementing such a program to avoid any attempt to rob students of their own culture patterns and replace them with one's own. Instead, the teacher introduces an additional set of patterns which the student can use while maintaining his identity and self-respect. Teachers trained for such an approach and materials designed for such a program are as yet rather scarce, and, thus, a drastic change in the contextual quality of ESL classes should not be anticipated for some time.

The primary function of standard English is to provide a means by which members of English-speaking society can communicate with each other. It is essentially a complex set of rules, much like the rules of baseball or chess and abandoning the rules or stretching them too far can result in a total breakdown of the game. That the rules of standard English are an arbitrary set of intrinsically no better than those of nonstandard dialects in no way detracts from their immeasurable value as the agreed-upon rules. To some extent, the drive for social justice depends on certain kinds of education,  and teaching the facts about languages and dialects may help to dispel one kind of prejudice. The school, however, must also continue to teach students to read and write the standard language, not as the language of the rich or powerful, but as the language of educated English speakers.

University degree programs in English, French, modern languages, linguistics, and teaching methods or education are outlined, including general program requirements for the B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. programs at Laval, the University of Montreal, McGill, the University of Quebec, Sherbrooke, and Sir George Williams University. The second section discusses the educational problems facing the Quebec Ministry of Education and universities involved in the updating and modernization of teacher training programs for language teachers. The author emphasizes the importance of four areas considered to be the foundation of all language teacher  programs: (1) knowledge of the second language, (2) knowledge of the student's environment, (3) knowing the student, and (4) knowledge of teaching strategies. Curriculum content for future programs is also suggested. (RL)",

Pending the possible adoption of federal legislation governing labor relations in public institutions, personnel officers who are without a state law governing labor relations activities may have to custom-tailor institutional policies, the design of which may be influenced by any number of groups of persons from administrative officials to students. In the legislative field the personnel officer needs to keep informed of the: (1) state or federal laws and the administrative and court decisions that apply to his institution; and (2) procedural regulations that have been adopted by the  administrative agency charged with interpreting, implementing, and enforcing the applicable legislation. In the field of union-management relations, the personnel officer or employee relations director also will need to keep current regarding: (1) faulty personnel policies and supervisory practices that may contribute to employee discontent and unionization; (2) successful tactics; communications, and merchandising methods used by unions during organizing drives; and (3) critical issues in recent negotiations in both the public and private sectors in the area.

(2) Financial anxieties have increased as well as anxieties about jobs, remaining in college, and whether the college experience will provide job opportunities. (3) The 1972 group exhibited great anxiety concerning sexual freedom. (4) The 1972 group were more socially and politically aware.

The plan was modified and expanded the following year and, with HEW urging, it became a model program adopted by many colleges. However, in the next several years the University of Pittsburgh learned, as many institutions have, that no matter how good the plans, the leadership, and the implementation strategies, social justice is difficult to achieve. The question arises as to whether or not any set of plans or programs is adequate in attempting to meet the letter and spirit of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The discussion presented is of an actual institution, the University of Pittsburgh, attempting to meet its commitments within a  framework of the law, its moral obligations, and institutional constraints.

A total of 39,705 survey forms were received by students and faculty members around the country; 14,098 of these were returned for a response rate of 35.15%. Results indicated about 76 percent of the college students in the U.S. hold either consistently anti-free market beliefs or philosophically contradictory beliefs about government and freedom. The same conclusion is indicated by research conducted among 2,205 faculty members from 2,169 colleges and universities throughout the U.S. Responses to statements about government intervention indicate that nearly four in ten students believe that the government can  be given more problems to solve without also giving it more power over individuals. Seventy-six percent of the college students believe that free enterprise is the system that best preserves freedom of speech, religion, press, personal behavior, etc. Faculty attitudes tend in the same directions: while chairmen of the economics and mathematics departments tend to be more favorable to the free-market philosophy than do students, the chairmen of the political science and sociology departments tend to be less favorable than students toward free enterprise.

It must continually assess its strengths and weaknesses, evaluate existing practices and restraints, anticipate future trends and evaluate alternative courses of action, formulate board strategies and specific programs for achieving its goals, and determine its priorities. Planning with flexibility for the effective allocation of scarce resources, to include elimination of its activities and  expenditures that are inefficient, unproductive, and do not contribute to the realization of its goals, has become an essential university function. The institution should establish and maintain a well-balanced posture with respect to autonomy and accountability, incorporate validated management practices to their optimum advantage while retaining a clear vision of the academic goals of the institution, move consistently toward its goals, and commit itself to a continuous program of self-evaluation and renewal.

Results indicated that: (1) Although it may be true that certain major programs of study initially attract students who score significantly higher than  the populations of other major programs of study, it has been shown that no major program of study either benefits or suffers significantly as the result of the net effect of student mobility. (2) When the curricular requirements of each major program were examined, a relationship indicating programs displaying a high net out-migration trend were found to require the greatest number of course-credit degree requirements, while programs displaying a high net in-migration trend were found to require the lowest number of course-credit degree requirements.

(2) In assessing dynamics of collegiate governance, it appears necessary to take institution effects into account only for some types of institutions. (3) Although issue effects differ from type to type, and within some types of institutions, it appears that faculty tend to perceive as more legitimate those governance processes in which they can expect to have relatively greater influence. (4) The loss of perceived  legitimacy frequently noted among American colleges and universities does not appear to be an all-or-nothing proposition.

The process is harmful to both private and public colleges from a philosophical point of view as well as from an economic angle. For the state systems to bail out the private colleges by absorbing them is extremely expensive as a total solution to the problem of affording private colleges. While the main issue--ending the low-tuition policy--is considered to be against the best interests of state institutions and against those of many students, failure to deal with the volatile proposal may result in the continued loss of many private  institutions, to the detriment of both sectors of higher education.

        "description":"The National Center for Higher Education, located at One Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C., has been perceived by many as a focus of power and influence for higher education. At the same time, expectations of members of the organizations have evolved because of such a power image. Thus, a dilemma may unfold whereby members expect output from their national organizations that cannot be delivered. The importance of a more accurate perspective of the nature and scope of responsibilities of the national organizations can benefit both the organizations and their memberships. This study deals with the fact that no one center can be the single influence or source for education. Higher education is too diverse, too competitive, and too large to be represented in any central manner. An  initial requirement is for a correct perception of the role of national organizations as part of a total enterprise. With a correct perception, constituencies can lead to positive influence on given issues or causes. It is to that objective that this study has been directed. This document provides a look at the organizations at the National Center, their internal workings, and how they are viewed by others. (Author/PG)",

Out-of-state tuition and fees rose more sharply, up 10.43 percent from 1973. Room and board charges not yet fully relecting food price increases were 4.72 percent.

The author cites two main categories of discrimination, the attitudes that have become ingrained in our culture, and the commitment to amateurism in the selection and recruitment process for administrative positions. The existence of the \"old boy\" system of recruitment makes it extremely difficult to break out of the pattern of amateurism and prejudice. The author recommends more programs like the University of Michigan has developed to prepare people for academic leadership positions, and declares that the idea of such training must become more widely accepted. He further suggests that  large universities should internalize administrative training programs and recruit more women for internships. As solutions to the problem of affirmative action, the author offers the following: increase the pool of available persons to include more women; increase the visibility of women within the pool; and use the leverage of existing legislation. In addition, the author urges men to examine their own attitudes for evidences of what he referred to as \"chauvinist piggery.\" (Author/PG)",

Sixty-nine percent of the supervisors and 38 percent of the interns returned completed questionnaires. Results indicated: (1) Both intern supervisors and interns overwhelmingly believe that the interns served well the people of North Carolina. (2) Both intern supervisors and interns have a high degree of satisfaction with the experience. (3) Interns show higher interest in The State Government as a potential employer after the internships than they did before. (4)  Supervisors and interns rank the most important result of the internships differently, with supervisors ranking additional manpower most important and interns ranking their educational experience most important. (5) Supervisors gained a healthier respect for the contributions students can make through internships and wished for more time to spend with their interns. (6) Supervisors seek better program planning, more involvement in the whole process and better overall communication. (7) Supervisors want to develop projects that can address a state need and then work cooperatively with colleges and students in defining program structure. Additional results are indicated.

This document contains the addresses of invited speakers concerning various aspects of the problem as well as background information. The main thrust of the conference was carried out through action-oriented workshops. Workshop I addressed the problem of the gap between technology and society and the role of women in reducing it, and  Workshop II considered women as engineers and their opportunities. These two workshops served as background primers. Workshops III, IV, and V considered programs for the effective participation of women engineers in industry, government, and education, respectively. A sixth workshop pursued the philosophical aspects of the problem being considered. In the summary an outline is given of workshop activities, including recommendations and resolutions.

        "description":"This paper presents a human capital risk analysis that attempts to estimate the effect of increased length of schooling on the amount of risk that impinges on the student in the future, considering earnings in conjunction with investment income. Nonpecuniary returns are ignored. Individuals' actual anticipations of future earnings, needed to compare with actual earnings to determine involuntary variance, were found in the Consumer Anticipation Survey of 3,535 families of above-average income in Boston, Minneapolis, and the San Francisco Bay Area. Each family was visited five times from mid-1968 to the end of 1970. Data calculated from survey results are presented before and after removing extreme outliers from the sample. Under certain assumptions, risk premiums fall with  increased schooling length, although part of the fall comes from interaction of education with nonwage income. However, earning variation increases at higher schooling levels, suggesting that advanced education is more \"specific\" and that the more educated choose riskier investment portfolios. (MJM)",

They illustrate why it is not unreasonable for most institutions to meet the federal objective of a 15% reduction in energy consumption, even if 1973 is used as the base year, but with some allowance made for new space added that year. A comprehensive list of suggestions primarily taken from existing programs at approximately 35 institutions is suggested as a cross-fertilization of energy conservation ideas. Other ideas solicited from federal agencies, utility associations and private industry are included. The suggestions are categorized broadly. There is no attempt to separate the design/construct ideas from those that  can be applied with little or no capital outlay through budgeted operating funds. (Author)",

The present report on the New College systems in Canada reflects the OECD higher education program concerning problems faced by countries in planning and setting up new structures of postsecondary education. The extraordinary expansion of postsecondary education in a country where the Provinces carry the full responsibility for educational matters presents a quasi-unique opportunity to analyze within a comparative framework different strategies aimed at the development and diversification of postsecondary systems. The report focuses on 3 new types of institutions, the Colleges d'Enseignement General and Professional (CEGEP) in  Quebec, the Colleges for Applied Arts and Technology (CAATs) in Ontario, and the Junior Colleges in Alberta, all of which were set up to provide a variety of educational opportunities at postsecondary level outside the existing university framework. All 3 college systems have a common denominator in that they represent the 'open door' nonuniversity section of higher education. A comparative analysis of their specific objectives, their internal organization, their curricula, their teaching staffs, their links with universities, and of several other aspects, shows clearly the variety of policies and solutions by which this 'open door' sector can become the essential component of a commitment to mass postsecondary education.

Most uses of comparable information and analysis can be grouped into three management functions: resource acquisition, resource allocation, and planning and management. The major benefits of comparative analysis come from determining why differences exist. The field review version of the procedures manual is concerned with directly assignable costs (that is, costs that can be assigned to specific activities). Full costing procedures, however, will be added  in the final edition of the procedures manual after they have been adequately pilot tested and reviewed. The dominant theme in the project is to provide for collection and exchange of those data that will provide funders, resource allocators, and planners and managers with comparable data on which to base valid judgments.

(2) There is a relationship between the academic rank of women in  top-level administration and their ages, the type of institutions attended at the master's and doctoral level, the reception of financial aid at the master's level, the number of positions held, the number of states in which worked, what they thought helped them gain their positions, for what they were responsible, and their reasons for working. (3) There is a relationship between the salary of women in top-level administration and the geographical regions of employment and birth, the occupation of their fathers, the education of their mothers, the type of institution attended at the master's and doctoral level, the holding of a doctoral degree, what they thought helped them gain their positions, to whom they were directly responsible, for what they were responsible, whether they carried  out policy or transmitted decisions, and the availability of tenure as administrators.

        "description":"The ADVISOR (revised form) was used to obtain student ratings of instructors and courses for classes offered in spring 1971. The classes were divided into nine groups according to the beginning time of class meeting to assess possible differential ratings by time. The first two subscales of the ADVISOR, Overall Evaluation of Course and Instructor, yielded significant overall F-ratios from a one-way analysis of variance, but none of the individual comparisons among the nine class meeting times were significant. The other two subscales did not yield significant overall F-ratios. By utilizing the above results and to assess the degree of relationship between ratings and time of class meeting, it was concluded that the time of day at which classes meet does not appreciably affect  instructor or course ratings.

All of them involve non-classroom, off-campus situations in which students are expected to perform tasks of some utility to the host organization. Whether distinctively educational benefits flow to the intern himself and to the university depends upon how the internship situation is structured. A productive internship should be conceived neither as a participant-research situation nor simply as a routine work situation. Rather, internships should be conceived and structured to provide a locus for experiential learning related to the intern's academic background. In addition, the internship should augment the host organization's capacity to achieve its goals. Recommendations for specific internship programs for  the Indiana University Center for Urban Affairs are predicated on the organizational constraints and opportunities presently facing the Center.

The core program provided instruction in  fundamental principles of research, skill-developing experiences, orientation in specialized areas of educational research, and an opportunity to engage in individual or cooperative research activities. Additional work in the last 2 years provides knowledge of multidisciplinary adjuncts to educational research, further specialized knowledge about research in a substantive field, and completion of a dissertation based upon quantitative research.

        "description":"To determine the perceived effectiveness of faculty representation on the governing boards of 53 fairly representative colleges and universities in the United States, a questionnaire was sent to college presidents, lay trustees, faculty representatives, faculty members and student representatives. Responses from 326 respondents indicated 81% judged their system of faculty representation to be effective, 89% wanted it to continue and only 45% preferred their system of faculty representation to a system of collective bargaining. Twenty-seven percent did not prefer faculty representation while the remaining 27 percent were undecided. Of the five groups of respondents only the presidents and the lay trustees revealed a clear majority favoring faculty representation over collective  bargaining. Only 37% of the total respondents viewed faculty representation as being more effective than collective bargaining. Although 51% did not want collective bargaining in addition to faculty trusteeship, 31% wanted both systems while 19% were undecided. Conclusions indicate that although faculty trusteeship may still be desirable because of its effectiveness in making improvements in certain areas such as communication and board competence, it cannot be an effective alternative to collective bargaining in achieving satisfactory faculty salaries and in protecting the academic freedom and tenure rights of the faculty.

The direct instructional costs for all courses provided by the Basic Science departments and the Schools of Allied Health, Medicine, and Dentistry are determined through standard-format budget review, faculty interview, workload study, and effort reporting. These direct costs are combined with indirect administrative and capital expenses to obtain a total Medical Center cost. Preprofessional course costs and internship costs are obtained from other educational facilities to provide a total cost per student. The cost data are used in a computer-based cost simulation modeling system to test the economic benefits of course-sharing in new degree programs. The model testing supports  a unified faculty decision to establish a new operational base of degree programs with one common goal so that students may be served through a core curriculum. An appropriate core curriculum is proposed, and the ramifications of its adoption are discussed. (Author)",

        "description":"The demand that institutions of higher education do something about the problems of the cities generated a great deal of discussion during the 1960s. Unrest within the university and in the city provoked a number of programs and projects that attempted to bring the resources of the university to bear on different aspects of urban life, and even sometimes to make these resources available to city-dwellers. These activities stimulated further discussion and controversy. This bibliography is an attempt to bring together those contributions to this literature that might be useful for those who have to plan the role of the university in the city in the new content of the 1970s. The basic concern of the literature review section is to analyze what the different writers have to  contribute to the self-understanding of planners of institutions and systems of higher education. The bibliography is divided into 6 parts: institutions of higher education; higher education in and for the city; university degree programs and the city; institutional activity in the community; planning active institutions; and bibliographies and directories. Some annotations and an author index are included. (Author/PG)",

The purpose of this investigation was to collect and analyze data concerning the perceptions of BDIC faculty on (1) the purpose and scope of the program, (2) the effect of participating in the BDIC program upon faculty teaching style and relationships with students, and (3) the effectiveness of the program's management. The research design for this study was formulated to reflect the basic intention of providing manageable and reliable information for making management decisions for  the BDIC program. An interview questionnaire was developed as the survey instrument. Responses to the questionnaire (25) indicate that participating faculty are convinced that the program serves a useful purpose. It would seem from the responses that the program is well managed, adequate support services are available, the Director and his staff are accessible, and there are channels of communication available for making suggestions for program improvement. The survey questionnaire is included. (Author/PG)",

The following conclusions can be drawn as a result of the project experience and research: (1) An institution can have an effect on the composition of work force on its construction projects; (2) It will be necessary for an institution to make deliberate decisions and take specific  action to provide equal employment opportunity on its construction projects; (3) Law and public pressure both within and without the institution are effective spurs to social change; (4) The project experience suggests that, while it is difficult to develop a cooperative structure among institutions with many different levels of response to the primary purpose, the attempt to create such a structure encourages action toward change among the individual participants.

        "description":"Voluntary initiative and voluntary support have been of fundamental importance in the establishment and development of the system of higher education in the U.S. Much of the superior quality of higher education is due to its diversity and its freedom from outside control. Voluntary financial support is one of the vital factors responsible for the independence of educational institutions, public and private alike. Voluntarism is now being challenged through the consideration of several proposals for changing the present tax treatment of private philanthropy. Those who advocate such changes do so in part on grounds of political philosophy and in part on grounds of equity. Some argue that the contributions' deduction encourages taxpayers to spend money that rightfully belongs to the  public treasury, and others hold that the benefits of the deduction favor the wealthy vis-a-vis all other taxpayers. Voluntarism should be encouraged. Philanthropy has served as an effective instrument of public policy in channeling private funds to education and has helped to preserve the pluralistic society that is so greatly valued in the U.S. It is imperative that voluntary support should continue to be encouraged by public policy, and that the provisions of the tax incentives should be maintained and strengthened.

        "description":"Radio has several advantages which give it great potential for improving living conditions in the rural areas of developing countries. It is the most universal mass communication medium and is presently able to support effective, low-cost local development programs. At present, the five most effective utilization strategies are the following: 1) open broadcasting to general audiences; 2) instructional radio for organized learning groups, such as those found in schools; 3) rural radio forums for local decision-making groups; 4) radio schools for non-formal learning groups; and 5) radio animation, involving group discussions with non-directive leaders (or animators). Current radio efforts suffer from the facts that they are often fragmented and without support from other agencies,  reach only a fraction of their potential audience, and lack proper planning, evaluation and administrative control. Radio's effectiveness will be improved if greater attention is paid to planning and cost analysis, if more research into radio strategies is undertaken, and if more personnel receive sufficient training to enable them to develop local awareness of and participation in radio programs.

First described are the steps found in any detailed task analysis, a process which results in the complete specification of each task involved in an overall maintenance effort. The factors influencing maintenance effectiveness are listed and the structure of maintenance jobs outlined. Job Performance Aids (JPA), which are step-by-step guidance procedures designed to reduce maintenance personnel training needs and to improve maintenance performance, are discussed, along with the more general concept of Job Oriented Training and the specific problem of the Job Task Performance Tests required for reliable, valid measurement. The results of two experiments are  also summarized; these indicate that inexperienced personnel using JPA perform maintenance tasks better than experienced personnel using traditional technical manuals. This supports the conclusion that the use of JPA improves both maintenance personnel training and the performance of maintenance tasks. (LB)",

        "description":"Research evaluated the effectiveness of varying television (TV) lesson formats. Adults ranging in age from 17 to 58 viewed lessons in accounting and psychology in four formats featuring: 1) a storyline running through a lesson; 2) a news magazine format dealing with different concepts in one lesson; 3) a non-authoritarian narrator; and 4) an authoritarian narrator. Results from achievement tests, interest ratings and student interviews revealed the following: 1) attitude outcomes were more influenced by TV format than were learning outcomes; 2) older adults showed a greater preference for authority figures; 3) the more interesting the course content was to the learner, the more he preferred a straight-forward presentation; 4) all learners preferred realism, positive themes,  documentary approaches and identification of instructional goals; 5) subjects often learned more than they expected and were surprised at how enjoyable the process was; and 6) younger learners were more responsive than older students to subtle instructional formats, but there was some overlap. It was concluded that adults do learn from innovative TV formats, that such formats do have holding power, and that individual formats have varying appeal to different groups. (Author/LB)",

        "description":"Research investigated the relationships between the characteristics of adult learners, aged 17 to 67, and their responses to learning via multi-media instructional programs. Students read materials in accounting and psychology, viewed video lessons and listened to audio tapes; post-treatment data were then collected. Results showed that: 1) the adult learner's educational level, enjoyment of educational television, self-concept, past academic achievement and future educational plans were all positively related to his reactions to innovative techniques; 2) general interest in the lesson was related to the degree to which the learners found the material useful; 3) reactions regarding both interest and usefulness varied for different subjects and different instructional formats; and  4) achievement of posttests was related to different learner characteristics for different subjects. It was concluded that adult learners reacted positively to the mediated approaches, but that both subject matter and personal characteristics influenced achievement and student acceptance. This suggested that the design of instructional meterials for adults in an open learning system will need to consider the subject matter at hand, as well as the specific nature of the target population, their interests and their backgrounds.

It seems as if officials in schools and government have negative attitudes about the usefulness of IT, resulting from the negative findings of recent studies about technology's effectiveness and from the fact that government and foundation support for IT is disappearing. To combat this, instructional technologists must develop a clear sense of purpose, undertake intensive research in their field, and communicate their successes to those in powerful policy-making positions. On the other side of the ledger,  some positive gains can be noted. Consumer information networks, such as the Educational Products Information Exchange (EPIE), provide educators with news of recent developments in instructional technology. In addition, special applications of IT for things like intensive instruction for disadvantaged students and for career education are becoming more prominent and progress is being made on the tailoring of IT to the special capabilities of individual students.

The mechanism which mediated such effects was also investigated. A total of 93 kindergarten children, drawn about equally from lower and middle class families, was divided between mothers' encouraged and non-encouraged conditions. Encouraging mothers had a profound effect on the amount the lower socio-economic status (SES) children watched the show and particularly on their enjoyment of the program. This in turn had an effect on their learning, attenuating significantly the original SES differences. It was concluded that encouragement of mothers to co-observe television had significant effects on the development of specific skills, mediated by  increased positive affect on the lower SES, but not in middle class children. Findings were interpreted as suggesting a decrease in experienced uncertainty and hence increased pleasantness as a function of mothers' active participation in viewing the program. (Author)",

This study investigated the impact of the Research Utilization Project (RUP) on public elementary schools in the District of Columbia. In the 16 schools selected by a multistage stratified sampling method, the total number of information searches and the degree of principals' satisfaction with RUP products and services were evaluated. The results showed: 1) the number of searches initiated in the target schools was greater than number of searches initiated in a comparable number of non-target schools; 2) the number of searches increased after the RUP had entered the target schools; 3) all principals gave the RUP high rating for those who had used it, but the principals'  rating of the RUP in their schools overall was considerably lower; 4) the principals held favorable attitudes toward the RUP and its expansion; and 5) there was no significant relationship between principals' attitudes and number of searches conducted for their schools. The favorable results suggest that the extension agent concept should serve as a model for the development of a system-wide information dissemination system. (CH)",

        "description":"The objective of this project has been the development of a successful approach for the incorporation of on-line computer technology into the undergraduate chemistry laboratory. This approach assumes no prior programing, electronics or instrumental analysis experience on the part of the student; it does not displace the chemistry content with computer related material. Readily implemented by an inexperienced undergraduate, it utilizes a real-time BASIC language and functionally-oriented general-purpose interface. The result is that the student can regard the laboratory computer as a very powerful routine experimental tool. An intensive three-week summer course was implemented for college instructors and practicing chemists to provide an introduction to digital instrumentation and  the technology of digital computer implementation in the laboratory. Other developmental activities have included the design of the Purdue Real-Time BASIC software system and the writing of a number of experiments, both in digital logic and in chemical analysis using the computer, which will be incorporated into the proposed Laboratory Manual. The appendixes of this report include the texts of seven of these experiments. (SL)",

A total of 250 parents, 244 teachers and 800 children in eight cities responded to questionnaires. Returns showed that better than 90% of the parents had positive attitudes toward the programs and felt that they fostered cross-cultural understanding. More than 80% of the teachers sampled considered the shows useful, reinforcing to their curriculum, and appropriate for children through grade two. Almost 99% of the children liked the shows, and test results showed that the content was 75% comprehensible and that it promoted language development. It was recommended that additional  research be undertaken to establish the programs' long-term learning effects, their utility in the classroom setting, and the learning differences which occur between groups of children who have been exposed to the programs and those who have not.

Optical scanning is regularly used at UOP to assist with data processing in the areas of admissions, registration and grade reporting and also has applications for other tasks such as football scouting, the compilation of graduation statistics and the maintenance of alumni records. The OPSCAN 100 with card output is currently used, but superior equipment has been designed and will be available when production problems are overcome. The error rates connected with optical scanning are tolerable and should approach 1% as the institution becomes experienced with its system. Errors can be well controlled if  sufficient attention is given to providing students and other users with clear directions for marking input and if the data processing forms are carefully designed.

        "description":"A programed course in general histology was completely developed by dental schools in the United States and Brazil. A group of international experts specified the course objectives, wrote and taped scripts for a series of 28 lectures of 50 minutes each, developed slides to accompany the lectures, prepared microphotographs and scripts to explain and illustrate laboratory microscope exercises, and devised daily quizzes. Evaluation of the program after its use showed that successful scripts could be cooperatively developed and easily translated to other languages and that the preparation cost was minimal. Daily quizzes contributed to increased achievement, and quiz scores correlated positively with final exam performances; quiz results also helped to identify weak students early in  the term and to highlight areas where remedial attention was needed. Students in general performed well; the lower ability students achieved more than they had in conventional instructional programs. Thus it appears that programed instruction can improve educational efficiency by providing better instruction to more students at lower costs and in less time, and it is recommended that hemispheric cooperation be developed for the production of additional programed instruction and long-range communications.

The Public Television Library (PTL), the national center for the exchange of public television programs between PTV stations, has provided libraries in Bloomington, Indiana; Jackson, Mississippi; and Norfolk, Virginia with 150 half-hour units of PTV programing on video cassettes. Video cassette machines have been installed in the libraries, and records are being kept of all phases of the operation. Data collected during the first quarter reveal the following trends: 1) Watch A Book patrons tend to be middle class users already familiar with the library; 2) user response is favorable and  equipment use is from 75% to 90% of capacity; 3) the largest group of users are from 17 to 30 years of age, followed by those in the 7-12 age bracket; and 4) cooperation between PTV stations and participating libraries is high. Thus, early indications are that a new avenue for public service can be established by making PTV programs available in public libraries. (LB)",

Questionnaire results, which must be regarded as tentative due to limited returns, indicated that use of the guide was increasingly widespread and that it was employed mainly as a teaching guide and as a reference. Viewers responded that they were using new methods, materials and equipment and that they gave more attention to helping students to enter the labor market. Administrators were indifferent to the program and the electronics teachers remarked that other types of dissemination  activities, such as workshops were also needed. It was recommended that future dissemination and instruction programs be revised to facilitate the examination of specific behaviors, that better evaluative strategies be developed, and that alternative dissemination and teacher inservice methods be considered and experimentally tested.

A survey was made of the cost-effectiveness techniques in current use, the differences among these techniques were examined in an analytical framework, and criteria for the selection of appropriate techniques were developed. The study yielded the conclusion that the variety of methods is due to choices available regarding 1) the level and process of analysis and 2) the analytical methods which can be employed. Selection of level and process was found to be generally beyond the control of the analyst, usually being determined by the nature of the study or the requirements of the requestor. However, a  certain latitude in cost-effectiveness analytical method selection was felt available to the analyst. This latitude was determined by the characteristics of the analytical techniques available for use and these, in turn, were identified as the tabular display technique and the analytical model technique.

        "description":"Among the several conditions which fostered the development of an open-circuit televised nursing course for Registered Nurses at Boston College was the limited availability of baccalaureate level programs in nursing for the Registered Nurse outside the Metropolitan Boston area. It was hoped that a televised course would permit wider access to needed instruction. In addition, Registered Nurses as adult learners have different needs and interests than beginning nurses. The course was intended to meet the needs of these students. It was anticipated that the televised course would also provide uniform course content and present nursing concepts in a situational and realistic context. Students had the option of watching the course on campus monitors or at home and received 3 units of  credit for its successful completion. Achievement in a clinical practicum which was required with the course was used as an evaluation of the televised instruction. It was determined that student learning was at least equal to that of the lecture course. The course was also evaluated by Video Nursing, Inc. As a result of the review, Video Nursing requested and received the national distribution rights for the telecourse and syllabus. Because of financial restraints, the open-circuit broadcast will not continue at Boston College. However, the course will continue to be utilized through closed-circuit television. (JG)",

In the case of medical data, a code must be designed to facilitate several different processes, including case management, administration, evaluation and research. Design of such a system can be facilitated by an examination of the theory, in which knowledge is represented by a formal model consisting of nodes and arcs connecting the nodes. Arcs are of five types: paradigmatic, syntagmatic, discursive, attitudinal and metalingual. Metalingual arcs, which allow for shifts in level of abstraction, provide the only natural means of passage among the several languages of medicine. The technical problems raised by these shifts have  been neglected in the philosophy of science, in linguistics and in information retrieval. Any cognitive network needs to record paradigmatic, syntagmatic, discursive and metalingual arcs; attitudinal arcs are also sometimes needed. Medical record files must be able to keep all types of linkages to provide accurate histories, and medical authority files need them to record the structure of the science. The SNOMed system provides some, but not all, of these linkages. (Author/SL)",

Under the Ministry of Information, the project has grown rapidly in recent years to include 600 clubs, each of which has a maximum of 31 members. A club is maintained by the two technicians, an animateur and an encadrew. They hold weekly meetings and discussions, provide the technical information for village projects, and send in a monthly written report to RR. A project proposal  recently made to the World Bank gives the cost estimates of an expanded educational radio project, but expanded production facilities alone cannot be a solution. Feedback and coordination between RR personnel and village groups, RR and the Ministry of Information, and the different ministries should be improved in order to meet local needs of special ethnic and geographical groups.

        "description":"Research investigated the utility of an alternative technique for the study of vigilance performance. The usual approach has been to study how well subjects responded to a signal of given difficulty; this technique altered the difficulty of the task to ensure a fixed level of performance. A computer-based, self-adjusting program presented background stimuli--a pair of dots 4.25 inches apart displayed on a cathode ray tube--and special stimuli--a pair of dots with wider spacing. The amount by which the latter width exceeded 4.25 inches was raised if subjects failed to discriminate it and lowered as they succeeded, to maintain a fixed discrimination rate. Results indicated that the adaptive variable behaved in a manner consistent with the usual measures of vigilance  decrement--i.e., that vigilance dropped sharply at first and then levelled off. Thus, increased widths for the special stimuli were required over time. It was concluded that this technique could be used as a research tool in vigilance studies and that it has practical applications for the training of human monitors of equipment in military, industrial, health and computer fields.

The report first presents a summary and overview of the entire CTW project and then describes how CTW met a national need. Management of a creative endeavor, the role of the professional advisor and the use of research for program building are next discussed. Program production and financial administration are  treated, along with the importance of audience participation, the efforts of CTW to reach the disadvantaged, and the process of getting the programs on the air. Current and future sources of funding are examined and the final chapter offers some comments on the Workshop in a fuller perspective.

        "description":"Research sought to test the utility of the Optacon (an optical-to-tactile converter, which enables the blind to read ink-print materials), to identify predictors of success with the Optacon, and to observe the Optacon's effect on student attitudes. Matched groups of blind students in grades 4 through 8 and 9 through 12 received instruction individually or in groups of three. Results showed that after 24 hours of instruction, students read with high accuracy but only limited speed (6.3 words per minute). Elementary and secondary students and individuals and groups performed equally except for superior accuracy for the older students and groups. Intelligence and tactile ability predicted reading speed and accuracy; grade level, spelling ability and attitude toward education  appeared predictive of accuracy. About 40% of the students could use the Optacon to read in a variety of situations, and this flexibility correlated with intelligence, tactile ability and the number of years for which the person had sight before becoming blind. No significant attitude changes were noted. It was concluded that accurate reading was possible with only limited training on the Optacon and it was hypothesized that reading speed and flexibility would increase during phase II of the project as students acquired more experience with the Optacon.

Under our labor-intensive system, instructional costs rise, but productivity doesn't; the system must either become less labor-intensive, through technology, or increase its revenues enormously. To achieve the former, the only alternative the taxpayer will accept, fiscal regulations must be changed to provide aid on the basis of student needs rather than on the number of teachers and curriculum and instructional decisions must be made, collaboratively, at the design stage, not at the classroom level. Management models must: 1) stop challenging the teacher's authority in the classroom; 2) use  interface forms which students, not teachers, favor; 3) make student evaluation a team task; 4) require teacher accountability; 5) provide students with instructional options; 6) promote administrative change to deal with logistical problems; and 7) work with teacher associations to make them realize that differentiated staffing is an unavoidable fact of life, but that within this context teachers' real wages will rise as productivity increases.

Yet the effectiveness of such policies has seldom been investigated. This study examined a circulation overdue policy, comparing selected variations in that policy. Three levels of the policy were judged critical: Group A, overdue notices and threat of encumbrance; Group B, overdue notices without threat of encumbrance; and Group C, no notice and no threat of encumbrance. The method of study used was a pretest-posttest-delayed post true experimental design, carried out over a 3-week period at the Purdue University General Library. All patrons, who checked out materials for the standard 21-day period, were randomly  assigned to one of the three groups. At 28 and 35 days after checkout, the percentage of books still outstanding for each group was compared. It was concluded that overdue notices serve as important reminders and improve the rate of book return. The threat of encumbrance is effective near the due date, though its effect diminishes over time. But the encumbrance system does not appear to have the cumulating and deterring effect of a fines system, where cost to the patron increases, the longer a book is withheld. (SL)",

The technique employed, called random sampling without replacement, meant that, from the total population of days in the Fall Semester, particular days for counting would be chosen at random and used only once. Confidence bounds and cost figures were estimated for each sample size, based on the 1972 statistics of the library. Time-and-motion study techniques were employed in the re-examination of functions currently performed by the exit-checkers at the library. Check-out and exit procedures were modified to increase efficiency, and rough estimates computed of the daily cost of counting  exiting patrons under the old and new procedures. In a university setting, library patronage is subject to such variables as vacations and exam times; therefore a stratified random sampling technique, where each day of the week was selected a given number of times, might yield lower error estimates than those computed by the &quot;pure&quot; random sampling method used in this study.

Researchers assessed the documents' quality and educational decision-makers evaluated their practical utility. Results showed that the researchers rated the overall quality of the RIE documents as low, but that their accpetance by decision-makers was high. Decision-makers with less research sophistication tended to overrate the quality of the documents; the quality of the  materials did not differ among the ERIC Clearinghouses, but was found to vary directly with the quality control level of the organizations which sponsored the research. The study, therefore, indicated that RIE often disseminated low quality information, which was likely to have harmful effects upon its intended audience.

        "author":["Etier, A. Faborn"],
        "description":"Electronically paced materials for teaching blind students to typewrite were written and taped. The effectiveness of the materials was tested, and a teacher's manual prepared. A control group was taught by conventional methods, while an experimental group used the electronically paced materials. These consisted of ten audio-taped programs for mastery of the alphabetic keyboard, 16 programs for skill development, and one program for the number keys. All students, who ranged from grades 6 through 10, moved at their own paces. Test results showed that the experimental group achieved greater understanding of the typewriter and how to manipulate it, demonstrated superior posture and stroking techniques, learned faster, and developed greater typing proficiency, speed and control. Since  these new instructional materials provided students with an effective means of communication and a marketable job skill, it was recommended that schools and counselors for the blind be informed of their availability and that additional programs be developed for teaching blind students to apply these typewriting skills for a variety of specific business and personal purposes.

Its development was necessary to permit the dissemination of CAI given the facts that: 1)existing CAI programs were written in over 60 languages; 2)the system for COURSEWRITER II, the most commonly used language, was discontinued by International Business Machines (IBM); and 3)an exchange of programs was found to be nearly impossible. PAL-X was built to contain answer-processing functions, to be independent of hardware and of machine, programing or author languages, to have simple, internationally recognized symbls, and to be capable of partition into subsets. The language was designed to function with non-generative and generative CAI;  operations, names and text were separated and the verbosity of programing languages avoided. It was constructed to be used for primary authoring of CAI, to date it has been employed to author CAI material at the University of Freiburg, to translate programs from COURSEWRITER to LIDIA, to introduce students to the principles of CAI, and to document a program in general chemistry.

Modifications of STAMP implemented on Washington University's IBM 360/65 computer include: 1) extension of the six beam capability to eight; 2) an option for generation of multiple beams from a single reflector system with an array of feeds; 3) improved system costing to reflect the time-value of money, growth in earth-terminal population with time, and to account  for measures of system reliability; 4) inclusion of model for scintillation at microwave frequencies in the communication link loss model; and 5) an updated technological environment. Results of a sensitivity analysis of the modified STAMP are discussed to indicate the program's capabilities.

        "description":"The potential for the electronic delivery of educational services to the handicapped child is great. The handicapped comprise 10% of the student population and include a variety of smaller subgroups; less than half of these students currently receive special education. Special education is generally labor intensive and often involves a team approach and inter-district cooperation. The development of electronic systems for the delivery of instructional services to the handicapped appears to be worthwhile pursuit, for it would allow educations to design discrete units with clear behavioral objectives, to create a pace instruction to the individual's needs, permit the on-site delivery of multi-sensory messages to dispersed populations and provide educators with nearly instantaneous  means of communication. A network for the production and distribution of instructional materials for the handicapped is developing under the auspices of the National Center on Educational Media and Materials for the Handicapped. However, additional funding and research is still necessary, and it must be recognized that in the future special education will remain labor intensive and that the role of the electronic delivery of instruction will be defined somewhat by the nature of the individual's handicap.

The study sought to define which library operations were susceptible to automation, to describe potentially useful automation techniques and to establish criteria for decisions about automation. Questionnaires were sent to 2104 federal libraries, of which 1012 responded. Major results included the findings that most federal libraries were of small or medium size, but had varied collections and offered many services. The library community favored automation, but recognized that better communication, increased manpower, and strong central support would be needed. A stronger role for the Federal Library Committee (FLC) was indicated  and centralized automated networks and standardized program packages for use in federal libraries were seen as desirable. As a consequence of these findings the research team recommended to the FLC the following objectives: 1) the development of generalized system components; 2) the selective development of centralized service; 3) the extension of service to the forgotten public served by federal libraries; 4) the development of standards; and 5) the provision of effective communication mechanisms.

First, an overall comparison of effectiveness between team teaching and traditional teaching revealed that: 1) students perceived team teaching as being a more effective method than the traditional single teacher approach; and 2) students were able to establish rapport in a team teaching structure as readily as they could under the traditional approach. Secondly, the extent to which the team approach was seen as effective depended on the organizational design of the team instruction. The students generally preferred a team in which there was a  clear indication of a team leader to a team in which no one person was clearly identified as the leader. They thought that the former condition was a more well organized, cohesive sequence of instruction and permitted a greater degree of student-teacher rapport. The finding of a high correlation between the students' perception of their learning effectiveness and teacher-student rapport calls for further research. (CH)",

        "description":"Technology, the systematic application of organized knowledge to practical tasks, has much to offer education, but a great deal must be done to realize this potential. Over $1.2 billion has been invested in technology by the United States Office of Education in the last decade alone, but educational technology is still in its adolescence; for example, audiovisual materials are still regarded as peripheral, hardware development outstrips that of software, and the learning industry is still oriented to products rather than clients and learning processes. Technology can make education more productive, immediate, individualized and scientific, but several obstacles must be overcome. These include the inertia and resistance of educators, legal and contractual barriers, public  skepticism toward technology's benefits, the lack of software, high costs, and the tendency to identify technological concerns as the responsibility of lower-echelon personnel. To meet these challenges, educators must reexamine their basic goals and institutional structures, disseminate the benefits of technological procedures, and commit themselves to technological change. In the course of so doing they should focus upon specific instructional problems, regard technology as central and integral tools, and search for new and vital ways of solving problems. (PB)",

        "description":"A computer-assisted instructional (CAI) program jointly sponsored by the English and Computer Science Departments at Red Deer College is being used to examine the ability of the computer to drill students in spelling. The program, called SPELLINGCLUES, runs in FORTRAN IV on an IBM 360/67 computer and covers a list of 100 frequently misspelled words. Students are asked, via audiotapes, to spell the words; the accompanying dialogue responds to both correct and incorrect answers, analyzes errors, provides examples of usage, and reminds students of appropriate spelling rules. Students control the sequence and pace of their individual programs and work in an atmosphere of privacy and anonymity. Formal evaluation has not yet been conducted, but preliminary indications are that the  program is successful. A revised edition is being prepared, which will be capable of more flexible diagnosis and which will be able to handle unexpected errors. In addition, more complex CAI programs are being planned to combine spelling drill with other aspects of written communication, such as punctuation and vocabulary usage. (PB)",

Surveys of student attitudes showed that undergraduates felt the course to be useful, that guest speakers enhanced the credibility and sophistication of the course, that films were not generally useful to the course, and that class discussions were difficult to conduct and unproductive. In  addition, more than 75% of the students stated that their attitudes toward computers changed significantly as a result of the course. In general, they gained more respect for the technical utility of computers but also felt more negatively about the overall social impact of these machines. (PB)",

In addition, recent research indicates that compressed audio tapes, in which speech is edited electronically by a sampling method so that the words-per-minute rate is increased without changing the pitch, volume or fidelity, contribute to increased instructional efficiency. Such tapes foster individualized instruction and allow material to be presented in less time, with no loss in learning, thus freeing both student and instructor time for other activities. Considering the facts that students spend from 40% to 90% of their class time listening, that listening skills can be taught and improved, that the use of  compressed tapes can improve reading skills and that the necessary tape equipment is available at reasonable prices, educators should begin to make more use of this instructional medium.

The sole purpose was to set in motion the Self-Instructional Materials Project to produce self-instructional materials which could be used in several institutions. The project developed self-paced, inexpensive instructional packages which could be exported to other schools; these materials also had to meet the criteria of possessing clear objectives and practice activities, being documented by post-test evidence of student learning, providing feedback to students, and of allowing for revision as needed. In its earliest stages 55% of the project time was allocated to faculty training, 30% to dissemination and the remainder to production, testing, and  revision; in the future the need for the first activity will decline, but more effort will be required for the last three. The first Directory of Self-Instructional Materials was published in 1972; 150 instructional packages were cataloged and over 4000 user orders resulted. A second edition is scheduled for 1974 and will contain 300 packages. The project has been successful to date and should make greater contributions as production, quality control and dissemination activities increase. (PB)",

CIN is composed of 83 libraries of six types: public, school, commercial organization, junior college, university, and non-commercial special. It is governed by a board of directors, composed of the County Librarian and six elected members, one from each type of library. The main expense involved so far has been the installation of TWX machines in 12 question referral centers. CIN's great advantage over other local library networks, is that it joins different types of libraries into one system, providing a large and varied pool of information to all  members. Yet the differing structures of member libraries has also posed problems which must be worked out if CIN is to succeed. It seems that an information and reference service is a feasible beginning to total library cooperation. (Author/SL)",

It is concluded that: 1) full MARC (machine-readable cataloging code) format for machine-readable records is needed to distribute cataloging information, but that it is feasible to use less complete records for the NUC; 2) the projected cost of converting other machine-readable data bases are comparable to or less than those for the present per record  MARC/RECON cost depending upon the method of updating; 3) data bases should be ranked by size and completeness of records; 4) standards should be established for reporting the form and contents of data bases; 5) automation of the NUC would cut time and costs and increase access points to the data.

Despite the facts that much of the content of both the country's generally accepted national goals and students' interests and problems is affective in nature, most schools concentrate mainly on the rote learning of factual material in the cognitive domain. Computers, looked at both from the instructional and the data processing viewpoints, can improve education in three ways. First, they can provide efficient cognitive instruction. Second, they free teachers to deal with affective matters such as values and feelings. Third, they create a situation in which the teacher can serve in a satisfying manner as  a human interface between students and machines. To implement this humanistic environment, educators will need to build process-oriented curriculums which have a balance between the cognitive and the affective domains, design better computerized information management systems, and conduct a national assessment of models of man-machine systems.

In this situation the data processor has a unique opportunity to contribute to educational efficiency and to human harmony, provided he adopts certain premises and procedures. Regarding the former, the student and the full range of his individual human needs must remain the central concern of the entire educational effort, despite increases in subject matter content and external pressures of all sorts. With respect to the latter, the data processing specialist should involve the whole spectrum of users in the design, evaluation, modification and operation of computer systems. The resulting systems can then be built so as  to preserve the identity of individuals, to remain under the control of and accountable to proper authorities, and to promote the development of mutually beneficial partnerships among all those involved in education.

Students should be shown that these machines can perform functions similar to those of man's mind, such as mathematical calculations, following instructions, remembering, reasoning deductively, comparing, observing, choosing among alternatives and conducting data analyses and simulations. In addition, students should be made aware of the practical applications of computers in education, environmental studies, science, industry, commerce, government and social policy-making.

It explains the logic underlying the program by showing that by so doing children, particularly those who are not yet engaged in learning, begin to discriminate and interpret the visual actions, objects and symbols they encounter in their own environments and thereby acquire an intrinsic, self-oriented motivation to develop the creative language arts competencies needed to comprehend and enjoy these experiences and to communicate them to  others.

Seven hypotheses were tested. Questionnaires were mailed to presidents of the 26 colleges, with a response rate of 100%. A total of 21 questionnaires were utilized in the tabulation and computation. The t and chi-square tests were used to validate the questionnaire data. Results of the data analysis showed: (1) there was a significant difference in the number of computer applications between the smaller and larger  Florida community colleges, and a significant difference between Polk Community College and all the other colleges; (2) there was a significant difference between administrative costs of the Polk Community College computer center and the other colleges with similar FTE size; (3) there was no significant difference between the costs of the computer centers; (4) there was no significant difference between mean costs per application and the number of applications in colleges with similar FTE size; (5) there was no significant difference between the cost of applications and the size of the memory core in community colleges with similar FTE size; and (6) there was no significant difference in the utilization, annual budget, and size of the memory core at colleges with similar FTE size.

        "description":"In response to the demand for accountability in higher education, colleges have adopted business techniques of planning and management systems in the form of Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Evaluation System (PPBES). The system approach to educational administration consists of three interrelated concepts: (1) input, (2) process, and (3) output. A PPB System has three basic capabilities: (1) an analytic capability for carrying out continuing in-depth analysis of the college's objectives and its various programs for meeting the objectives; (2) a multi-year planning and programming process, which utilizes a computer-based management information system for providing data useful for management decision making; and (3) a budgeting process that translates program decisions into a  financial plan in a budget form. PPBS was selected for implementing long-range planning in Florida, as it places emphasis on all educational functions and activities and on sharing common objectives. Three community colleges in Florida were selected as pilot centers and began an effort to implement PPBS. Their progress varies in relation to meeting a 1975-1976 deadline. The Florida plan for accountability via PPBES has considerable merit for attaining participatory college governance by every level of the college structure. It is envisioned as a participatory system in which every member of the college community will have some input as to the way the college is governed. (For related documents, see JC 740 024-026.)

The 1202 Commission created by the Higher Education Amendments of 1972, in which State commissions coordinate planning of postsecondary institutions, represent a threat to this new role. The primary responsibility of the board of trustees is to see to it that the institutional programs and services are provided to the people who can benefit from them in the most effective and efficient manner possible. Trustees hold assets in trust; therefore neither students nor faculty, as beneficiaries of the trust, should serve as trustees. Trustees should not evaluate the results of a plan, since they should be part of the team that  established the objectives and made the plan. Planning, which is a continuous process, and evaluation should emphasize effectiveness over efficiency. A strong trend exists on campuses toward collective bargaining, which may be destructive to the higher education process. The best approach to this problem is to find a way to make governance work so that collective bargaining is within the institution's governance structure. To achieve shared governance, the administrative structure and the governance structure, which have been isolated in community colleges, must be brought together. Shared governance also necessarily involves changes in leadership and decision-making. (KM)",

No attempt was made to go beyond the data included in these reports. The findings show quite clearly the diversity that exists among the 32 colleges, as well as the heterogeniety of the students enrolled in them. Additional information about the colleges will be presented in subsequent reports, which will be useful in interpreting differences among student bodies, in both their persistence and performance. The study is thus the story of a representative group of 32  colleges, as well as the story of more than 32,000 students. Data for the following are tabulated for the first report: (1) total enrollments by college; percentages in credit classes by class level and percentages in noncredit classes; (2) enrollments in day and evening credit classes; (3) enrollment status of freshmen, sophomores, and other students in credit classes; (4) first-time freshmen, day and evening, by location of high school last attended; (5) first-time transfer students, day and evening, by type of institution of origin; and (6) summary of credit and noncredit students by age, sex, and enrollment category.

One-third of the group graduated from high school that same year, usually from a high school in the college district, but two-thirds were distributed over a wide range of ages, amounts of prior college experience, geographic origins, and courseloads attempted. The diversity in their objectives and programs may be only inferred from the observed diversity in their personal characteristics. Variation in length of attendance and rates of persistence in the Community Colleges will surely be related to this diversity in objectives and programs and, indirectly, to the personal characteristics of the students. The multitude of functions performed by the  Community Colleges is also reflected in the diversity of the student body. Full-time programs of occupational education, general education, and transfer courses meet the needs of only a minority of the students now enrolling. Short-term occupational programs and part-time, one-term enrollments in specific skill courses appear to be satisfying the needs of still another large group of students. The other major category of students includes adults of all ages who are pursuing a variety of short-term objectives not necessarily directly related to their employment.

        "description":"A year-long research project was conducted concerning chartering as a potential management and communications tool in vocational-occupational education. Chartering is defined as a management tool which allows two individuals in the same or related organizations, sharing different levels of the same mission, to achieve an understanding of each other's needs and capabilities by establishing a mutually helpful relationship. The process is one whereby: critical issues are identified through scanning; essential parts of a critical issue are organized through mapping; agreement and validation are achieved through communication with significant others; and the performance record, value and worth of programs are reported through showing evidences of accomplishment. Preliminary interviews  were conducted with 51 local, State and Federal vocational occupational administrators to determine their perceptions of the need for chartering and the process itself. Field tests of the process were then conducted with 56 high school and community college administrators. These administrators received training in the chartering process in two workshops. Through a questionnaire and followup interviews, data were gathered concerning the participants' perceptions of the process. Analysis of the data indicates that most participants viewed the process as beneficial to them and the time to be trained in the process as the primary cost. Recommendations for future use of the process are offered. (For related document, see JC 740044.) (Author/KM)",

The Sample Class Plan for Projecting Output and Constraints is the method of setting Instructional output objectives. For this plan, each instructor selects one of his classes each semester as his sample class, and learning problems and ways of achieving objectives are discussed by the instructor and an administrator. Service function objectives are prepared by administrators and discussed with faculty-student committees. Output costs are considered in the light of  learning constraints and institutional efforts to resolve them.

A survey of California community colleges revealed that the information desired about students is how well they can write, how well they can read, and how well they can apply basic mathematics skills and that the test should not exceed $3.00 in cost and should run about two hours. ETS's offer of a free trial administration of the Comparative Guidance and Placement Program was accepted to provide the opportunity to compare the results with prior ACT scores. CGP component plan eleven, which includes sentences, reading and mathematics, was administered to 26 Reedley College first-semester freshmen and 137 Reedley High School seniors. The scores of the freshmen were compared  with their ACT scores, and those of the latter group were compared with the ACT scores of the 1972 entering freshmen. Results revealed, for practical purposes, no significant differences, indicating that CGP can be used to screen for placement as effectively as ACT or SAT. In actual use, the cost of this CGP plan would be about $2.00, with a testing time of two hours and fifteen minutes. It is recommended that the CGP be considered for adoption for admission and placement. It is also suggested that ETS work on improving the answer sheet and the explanation of the math portion. (KM)",

        "description":"Since collective bargaining is a practice that is growing even more rapidly in community colleges than in other areas of higher education, the concepts involved in bargaining and contracts are of particular interest to community colleges. Contracts differ from policies in that contracts require the approval of all parties, who are considered relatively equal, while policy regulations do not. Collective bargaining changes the traditional collegial governance pattern by making faculty members employees, an arrangement under which they have more decision-making power. Collective bargaining also induces a change in management relationships among administrators because many of the interests of administrators below the rank of president are not represented in the bargaining. The  employee bargaining unit is composed of instructors, counselors, librarians, coordinators and, frequently, chairpersons. The inclusion of certain nonacademic employees is dependent upon the need for influence and revenue and the possible assignment of nonprofessionals to classes during a strike. The employer bargaining unit usually consists of members of the governing board. The employees' position that anything is open for negotiation usually prevails over the employers' position that negotiable items are restricted. Definitions of management rights differ, but the agreement itself necessarily diminishes these rights. Contract statements of employee association rights are much more detailed. Workload formulas and grievance procedures are important points in agreements, and most contracts  contain no strike/no lockout pledges. (KM)",

        "description":"The present method of governance of California's public higher education, including the Coordinating Council for Higher Education, has worked well for coordination of the three segments of public higher education--the University of California, the California State University and Colleges, and the 96 California Community Colleges. A combination of local boards, statewide boards, and a coordinating board provides an effective system of governance. The processes and mechanisms for college governance should be established at the campus level, with appropriate review at the system level, and corrective measures, where necessary, at the legislative level. Local boards and child executive officers of each campus should be given responsibility--and strict accountability--for governance  of their campuses. At the same time, its is the responsibility of the statewide board to insure that due process is observed on each campus, and that faculty, students and other members of the campus community are consulted and have some appropriate advisement role in the decision-making process.

Factor analysis was used to reduce the number of variables. Three factors each for students and teachers accounted for most of the variance. Student factors included the student's sense of futility, and two expectation-evaluation-self-concept factors, one  dealing with the present and the other with the future.

Most of the tests with these supports facilitated performance in comparison to the standard conservation test. Conservation appeared earlier than usual. There were significant effects of supports which emphasized correspondence and deemphasized length cues, unclear effects of the number of objects, and no effect of interest value of the stimuli. There was a set effect; i.e., beginning with the easiest test produced more conservation overall than did beginning with the most difficult test. It was proposed that the development of conservation involves several levels, varying from an early rudimentary understanding of invariance  to the final, mature conception of number. (Author/SET)",

        "description":"This document, presented at a symposium on violence and aggression in America, reports a longitudinal study of environmental influences in the development of aggressive behavior. Subjects were 875 third graders when originally assessed with a peer nomination technique in 1960. High, moderate, and low degrees of aggression were identified in the population, and information was collected on the following kinds of variables: (1) instigators, (2) reinforcers, (3) identification, and (4) socio-cultural. Each of these factors was significantly related to aggression in the original data analysis. In 1970, 427 of the original subjects were located and reinterviewed. The sample was overloaded with low aggression youths, indicating a relationship between residential mobility and aggressive  behavior. The second assessment included retesting with the peer rating, self-reports to determine extent of aggressive habits, and administration of the MMPI. Analysis of results indicates the stability of aggressive behavior. At age 19, subjects' aggression was predicted only by identification and socio-cultural variables. Significant sex differences were apparent. Discussion focuses on socialization factors in the development of aggression, particularly sex role development and the influence of modeling through television. (DP)",

        "description":"This project was prompted by concern about the tendency for temporary foster care to drift along without definite plans for the child's return home or movement into adoption, long-term foster care or other alternative arrangements. The foster care section of the Rhode Island Department of Social and Rehabilitative Services served as a \"laboratory\" to test certain strategies to combat this drift. The agency was divided into three segments: (1) in one section, a monitoring system was established that required the worker to review each case at 3-month intervals and indicate what action he was taking to implement plans for the child, (2) in the second section, this monitoring system was combined with the assignment of special workers to selected cases where intensive work with the  parents might facilitate the child's return home or the parents' acceptance of other plans for the child, and (3) in the third section, work proceeded as usual. Results showed that differences in the length of time in care of the children in the three segments made more difference in rate of return home than did the strategies introduced. The 1-year service project involving 413 children proved too brief in many cases to accomplish the tasks needed to ready parents to reestablish a home for their children or to reach alternative plans. However, the monitoring system led workers to more realistic planning and the use of special workers led to more discharges from foster care. (CS)",

The procedure included an infant assessment with the Brazelton Neonatal Assessment Scale, a mother-infant interaction observation during feeding, and an interview concerning maternal attitudes and perceptions. The findings suggest that there are consistencies in infant state and behavioral measures across situations. The data also suggest consistent and interactive relationships between patterns of maternal stimulation and infant behavior in corresponding areas. For example, the attentive, sensitive mother tends to have a responsive baby and vice versa. The findings provide additional meaningful information about the  early development of the complex relationship between children and parents. (Author/SET)",

Two training tasks were used during two half hour training sessions for the experimental groups: the Haptic Visual Matching test and the Conceptual Styles Test. The results did not reach statistical significance, but indicated a trend of increased response latency and  decreased match-to-sample errors for both experimental manipulations. Both experimental groups, compared to the control group, modified impulsivity to some extent, especially for boys. Comparing the visual scanning training group with the forced-delay group, the former tended to increase latency more for the boys; there was no significant difference between the two techniques in decreasing errors.

All urban S's were in school, while only the two younger rural groups were in school, and older rural S's had little or no schooling. The S's were tested on a short-term and incidental memory task. Developmental trends in memory performance for the Urban educated S's were very similar to those reported for analogous tasks with American middle class subjects. The performance of rural S's did not show these consistent developmental changes. This fact, along with the results of several features of the data, support the hypothesis that formal schooling is an  important factor in the development of mnemonic skills in short-term memory. Data from the incidental memory task implied that the development of selective attention is independent of short-term memory development and is probably influenced by both school and certain cultural factors.

Sociograms, as maps of affect flow among children, reveal both functional and maladaptive patterns of classroom interpersonal behavior. Research findings are related to analysis of \"centralized\" and \"diffuse\" patterns of classroom sociostructure, particularly as functions of the type of sociometric question asked. Three sociometric areas were examined: \"affective,\"\"rejective\" and \"helping\" relationships among children. The academic status and rejection socioquestions were found to be most highly centralized phenomena while affective and personality-based socioquestions revealed the most highly diffuse patterns of sociometric structure. This research in self-contained  classrooms suggests that comparative studies would be valuable in more open and individualized classroom organizations. (Author)",

(2) How well can Piagetian studies help determine the importance of and differentiate between the factors affecting mental development? (3) Of what practical significance is cross-cultural Piagetian research? and (4) What types of research within the Piagetian framework might be helpful in the future?

A synergic effect is posited by bringing together research areas that had formerly remained somewhat autonomous: Neurophysiology, vision, hearing, parent attitudes, affective domain, comparative school entrance ages, and cognitive psychology. Following a synthesis of these data, the author concludes that there has not been a single replicated experiment that has clearly demonstrated the desirability of early schooling or day care for the normal child who can have the security of a reasonably good home. Research evidence seems to validate the undesirability of placing children under 8 years in programs of cognitive emphasis which  require consistent reasoning abilities. Contrary to this, warm and consistent proximity to one's parents until age 8 appeared to be a greater predictor of eventual stability and cognitive maturity than any special effort toward cognitive development. Except where extreme handicap or deprivation indicates clinical needs outside the home, the educational implications of current research indicates that future efforts should emphasize parent and home education.

PREP identifies 4-year-old children with a high risk of school failure and plans a program of home intervention, using the mother as the change agent. High school students also work with the 4-year-olds and receive training for their future roles as parents. The beneficial aspects of the program are ubiquitous: the family unit is enhanced by the increased skills of the parents; learning problems are ameliorated or prevented, younger children in the family benefit; future  parents are given good foundations for parenthood, and school-community relations are improved. Research and evaluation indicate a high rate of success and effectiveness, and the cost of this program is within the low to moderate range. (Author/CS)",

This project involved the intensive individual examination of every child early in the first grade - psychiatrically, neurologically, psychologically, and educationally - to identify those children vulnerable to emotional decompensation and to learning failure. A program of appropriate intervention was designed for each child based upon stimulation of those specific areas of defect revealed by his perceptual and neurological profile. Results, extending over a 4-year period, show that these children can respond to  an intervention approach. Surveys of the project schools revealed that at least one-third of all children in the first grades did not have the perceptual and neurological organization needed to learn to read. The pervasiveness of these problems highlights the need to provide early, school-based intervention to prevent learning failure and to interrupt the destructive influence of learning disability upon emotional development.

        "description":"This survey, based on interviews with 896 parents, was undertaken in the Bank Street Follow Through Program in Spring 1972. The parent interview developed out of the belief of parents in the program and of Bank Street as sponsor that a program evaluation could be a fruitful project because (1) the process of the interview could be instructive to the parents, (2) interview results could provide a measure of parent attitude, (3) training in interviewing techniques for the parent interviewers could widen parent participation, and (4) the interview project could stimulate interest in parent-directed evaluation. Part I of the interview was designed to measure the degree and quality of the relationship between home and school. Part II of the interview was designed to assess the  effectiveness of the Follow Through staff in providing broad services to Follow Through families. Part III of the interview was designed to measure parent participation in parent activities in Follow Through. It was concluded that the parent interview could become an instrument for ongoing self-study and development of the parent group. A summary of responses to the parent questionnaire is appended.

Participants were 7th and 8th grade students in an all-Indian private school, St. Mary's Mission (Catholic), on the Colville Indian Reservation in Washington State. Data were collected from November 1969--May 1970. The 54 students were from economically deprived homes in which a majority of parents were separated by unemployment, emotional problems, serious drinking problems, divorce, or death. The results generally provided significant support for the effects of contingent tangible reinforcement on all the dependent variables. In addition, it was  discovered that termination of the reinforcement after 14 weeks led to only minor reductions in academic performance and slight increases in classroom disturbances during the final post-experimental baseline period. Several possible interpretations for this resistance to extinction were offered. Finally, several findings on the relation of selected attitudes to performance variables were presented in tables.

It examined one possible means of overcoming some of the overwhelming handicaps experienced by migrant children by using indigenous paraprofessionals as a humanizing, tutorial factor. Eighty migrant students, in both the 5th and 6th grades, were chosen for this study when they were residing in the San Joaquin Valley (California) during the 1971-72 school year. The 35 paraprofessionals used were mostly Spanish speaking. The amount of assistance received by each migrant child was recorded by resource teachers in the 34 school sites surveyed. The research indicated that: (1) lower achieving intermediate students who received  paraprofessional assistance showed greater achievement than children who received no such help; (2) paraprofessional assistance in reading was somehow especially beneficial to 6th grade boys; (3) there were no differences between 5th and 6th grade levels in achievement gains; and (4) although it was expected that the lowest achieving student might benefit the most from paraprofessional assistance, this was not the case. Subjective conclusions about minimal achievement gains were listed, along with suggestions for improving paraprofessional assistance and recommendations for further research. (KM)",

Data were obtained from Black families in a large metropolitan center, a small town (about 5,000 population), and 2 small open country villages in East Texas. The respondents were female homemakers, not over 65 years of age and not under 18 (unless they were the mothers of at least 1 child), with children in the household. Over 94% of persons in the nonmetropolitan areas who met these criteria were interviewed in June 1970. Findings and conclusions are limited because the populations involved are homogeneous and relatively small. Although a  general conclusion cannot be drawn about M and NM differences because the M sample is not representative of the total metropolis, a general conclusion is made that education, income, and occupation had more significant effects on family disability than did M-NM residence. Family disability was much more prevalent than individual disability affecting approximately 1/4 of all the families studied. (FF)",

A research review demonstrated an eclectic array of studies that were conceptually deficient and difficult to integrate because of varying frameworks. Within this frame of reference an attempt was made to introduce conceptual specifications related to disability that would make it possible to move logically from research in disability at the biological and psychological levels to disability induced by these in the role-set of family actors and in the social  structures of family units. Five suggestions for future research were presented. Two of these were: (1) systematic codification and synthesis of past research on family interdisciplinary potentials; and (2) descriptive research relative to incidence of disability of all types in families on various types to develop a capability for generalizations relative to the incidence and distribution of each.

        "description":"The purpose of this paper was to explore the extent to which differentials in occurrence and degree of disability existed among selected families of different ethnic types--Southern blacks in Texas, Spanish speaking farm migrants in California, Hawaiian Ethnics; and whites in Wisconsin and Vermont. Respondents were homemakers between the ages of 18 (younger if they were mothers of at least 1 child) and 65 having children in the household. The stimulus question for disability was \"Is anyone in this family sick all the time or disabled in any way?\" Interviews were completed in metropolitan areas for 294 homemakers in Texas, 202 in Hawaii, and 208 in Wisconsin. They were completed in nonmetropolitan areas for 259 homemakers in Texas, 169 in California, and 218 in Vermont. Data  indicated that: (1) individual and family disability were influenced to a greater extent by ethnicity than by place of residence; (2) there were no significant differences in number of family members disabled according to place of residence or ethnicity; (3) place of residence affected the positional distribution of disability; and (4) place of residence differentials had a significant affect on the magnitude of disability.

To relieve the inconsistancy in the childrens' diets, the school provided breakfast, lunch, and an afternoon snack. Health services were also provided. Special instruction was given to teenagers. The main impetus was the Summer Laboratory School for children in grades K-6. The overall program of the Laboratory School was based on the Integrated Day Approach to Elementary Education. Behavior modifications through actual experiences between teacher-teacher and  teacher-student were planned to make the staff strong advocates of a total K-6 program with the skills, perceptions, and insights necessary to engage totally into the adopted program. All the activities focused on the childrens' interests and benefits. Academically, the Wide Range Achievement Test produced positive results. The Teenage Program tried to use the natural pride of the students' home environment and activities to close the gap with their academic world. Migrant parents approved of the results and hoped that the programs would continue. (FF)",

The program was unique since one instructor conducted this program in two schools which were in separate rural districts (Dexter and Hagerman). Since both communities were primarily agricultural, with small student populations, the cost of such a program was prohibitive for either district. Objectives were to establish a program in the two schools that was sufficiently flexible to meet students' needs, and to develop a distributive education curriculum. The project was financed through local schools and the Vocational Education Division, State Department of Education. A preliminary survey indicated that students who were previously identified as potential dropouts, and who enrolled in  the program, were still in school. It was felt by the distributive education teacher and the school administration that this program was increasing the holding power of small schools. (KM)",

The Slosson Intelligence Test and the Wide Range Achievement Test were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the Engelmann-Becker Follow Through Program in motivating students. At the time of this study, the Engelmann-Becker system was used in 5 elementary schools on the Rosebud Sioux Reservation, South Dakota. Seventeen classrooms in these schools used the Engelmann-Becker curriculum. Of the 421 students enrolled in the classrooms, 390 were Sioux Indian children. It was concluded that motivation is a very difficult thing to measure with the existing testing devices used in the Follow Through Program. The tests did  indicate that the students were doing quite well in reading but were lagging in spelling and arithmetic, which could be attributed to the tremendous reading program offered to the Follow Through students. Several parents have questioned some of the methods of instruction in this program. Three recommendations are presented, e.g., experimenting with new methods that might find better ways of teaching spelling and arithmetic to these students. (FF)",

The method used included a review of the current available literature. Additional information was obtained through interviews with Education Professions Development Act Indian panel members and parents of school age children on South Dakota reservations. Most teachers felt that Indian homes do little to assist the school in encouraging attendance and attention to schoolwork, and therefore better communication  must be established between school and parent. An active advertising campaign to increase parental interest in the Indian schools was needed. The schools needed to become active in all local, county, and state competition in academic and recreational activities. Several recommendations were presented, e. g., changing the teaching methods and classroom setting to accommodate Indian learning styles by teaching Sioux language, nature lore, moral values, and by bringing the Indian point of view into the classroom.

The critical dimensions of the issue being discussed are the principal needs of healthy state systems of elementary-secondary education; the role and function of state education agencies; the primary needs of the local school district; and the essential governance and organizational requirements of service units. Potential points of conflict are given, such as how local districts can have substantial and meaningful input into the workings of the service unit if the activities of the  latter are subject to review by the state education agency. The proposed solution to the problem is establishing, by statute, a statewide network of regional units to which all state school districts must belong. The explanation of the proposed solution additionally covers its establishment, governance and organization, financial structure, programs and services, and regulatory functions for the state education agency. Some specifics on the service-regulatory mix and major advantages of the model are also covered. (KM)",

Since sufficient school finances will continue to be a problem, educational managers will look to cooperatives for greater efficiency. Rural school districts will likely resist the loss of local control and will cooperate with other districts to avoid consolidation. School districts with decreased enrollments will likewise look to cooperatives to provide the same services to fewer students. However, cooperative and regional educational services agencies must recognize the potential they possess, and must take the initiative as \"brokers\" of cooperative  education. Subdivisions of the discussion are: awareness as a key factor; the influence of economics; cooperatives and the concept of accountability; cooperation as an alternative to bigness; cooperative agencies and declining enrollments; cooperative agencies and educational alternatives; local control and cooperative educational service agencies; and the cooperative educational service agencies and their place in rural education.

The topic of discussions are (1) rationale for regional center services; (2) regional service center services: general services (planning, awareness, specialized staffing and liaison) and other services (instructional services, instructional support services, and administrative services). The report  concludes that, although there is ample evidence that documents the value of regional service agencies to nonmetropolitan schools, particularly the smaller ones, the more troublesome task is to discover and operationalize services which provide additional advantages to larger schools.

Investigated for their  effect on the Chicano child, 5 areas are covered: (1) curriculum; (2) grade retention, ability grouping, and assignment to classes for the educable mentally retarded; (3) teacher education; (4) counseling; and (5) Title VI, Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and equal educational opportunities for Mexican American students. Numerous findings and recommendations are given by these subject areas. The report also gives 3 basic principles that relate to all of the specific recommendations and which should govern educational reform for Chicano students: (1) Mexican American culture, language, and history should be inherent and integral parts of the educational process; (2) Mexican Americans should be fully represented in decision-making positions that determine or influence educational  policies and practices; and (3) all levels of government should reorder their budget priorities to implement the given recommendations.

Identical surveys of high school sophomores from 3 rural, nonmetropolitan East Texas counties carried out in 1966 and 1972 provided the data. A total of 941 males and females were interviewed. Findings indicated that  boys and girls of both races demonstrated change in the same direction between 1966 and 1973 for aspiration level, expectation level, and intensity of aspiration, although a consistent racial difference in magnitude of change was observed. Specific patterns of change were listed in outline form under 2 categories--general and race. A general suggestion for future research involving interpretation of data on youths' educational projections can be gleaned from an examination of the parallel analysis of data presented--quantitative (means) and qualitative (%distribution).

Since the arrival of the white man in America, Indians have faced a world of cultural conflict. Throughout the history of Indian education, their values and way of life have been demeaned. The Indian people and the U.S. government are presently going through the era of self-determination for Indian people. If the Indian is to control the education of his children, he will be faced with the responsibility of determining the direction for that pedagogy. The following are 3 divisions of culture that exist in and characterize the Indian community, and that will be influential in directing that community's system: (1) the  traditionalists or conservatives; (2) the moderates or biculturalists; and (3) the progressives. This essay emphasizes community control, by Indian people, of Indian schools. (FF)",

What students do once they have completed grade 12 determines what kind of educational system is to be built. However, in the case of minorities, especially Native Americans, professionals have assumed that schools are socialization agencies, that they are terminal institutions, and that skills are secondary to socialization. A school system needs both ends and means, but schools for Indian children lack ends. The discussion of post high school institutions is not so much a criticism of existing or projected programs as a questioning of ends. It appears that decisions have been made about where Indian students are going mainly on the basis of means. Too often institutional functions replace goals  or ends as the most important concern of policy makers. The essay emphasizes that means should be subordinated to ends, not the other way around.

To determine the validity of such an approach, an evaluation design was conducted over a 3 year implementation period. The 2 categories of instruments used for the evaluation were: (1) academic--Yupik literacy and numerical skills; (2) linguistic--acquisition of grammar and meaning in Yupik and English. The analysis procedure was the method of t-test for differences between independent  group means. The statistical analysis results are presented in 3 sections: (1) literacy, (2) numerical skills, and (3) linguistic skills. In each section the results are generally described, followed by a brief discussion of the overall patterns as a whole.

The 2 categories of instruments used for the present evaluation were: (1) academic--Yupik literacy and numerical skills; (2) linguistic--acquisition of grammar and meaning in Yupik and English. The analysis procedure used was the method of t-test for differences between independent group means. The results of the statistical analysis are presented in 3 main sections: (1)  literacy skills, (2) numerical skills, and (3) linguistic skills. In each section, the results are generally described, followed by a brief discussion of the overall patterns as a whole. Program recommendations in the final section of the report cover: (1) instructional objectives, (2) math, (3) alphabet, (4) creative writing, and (5) English as a second language. (FF)",

        "description":"The Right-to-Read Project was introduced into 7 school districts in Region 1 (Texas) in September 1972. Bilingual program materials developed under an Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) Title VII grant were placed in 34 kindergarten classrooms with an enrollment of approximately 900 students. Because of late enrollments, the number of classrooms increased to 38 and the number of students to 1,000. The materials placed in the classrooms were the first year of a sequential, 4-year program for Mexican American children with little or no knowledge of English. They consist of: (1) Spanish Reading--Region One Literacy Lessons (ROLL), and (2) English as a Second Language--Region One Curriculum Kit (ROCK). Project personnel included 5 staff members and 38 classroom teachers.  The program had 7 objectives such as: students must demonstrate they can relate sounds to compose words in their native language; students in the Spanish Reading Program will demonstrate an awareness that the correspondence between letters and sound is not always one-to-one; students in the English as a Second Language Program will be able to generate orally at least 3/4 of the sentence patterns contained in the ROCK I Kit. A goal established for the project was for each classroom to complete reading the 5th booklet in the Spanish Reading Program series by the end of the school year. Fifteen percent of the classrooms actually finished booklet #5, and an additional 17% had started it. The English as a Second Language program progressed as planned, with approximately 65% of the classrooms  completing over 90% of the 128 lessons in the program and 85% completing 80%. (KM)",

The project was designed to develop a 3-quarter transitional program concerned with the development of basic skills, career planning, an introductory core in 2 career area clusters, work experience of both a general and vocational nature, and work habits. It involved the recruiting of 20-25 Indian youth per quarter to start into the 3-quarter sequence. This project provided seed money to: (1) open access to college programs to Indian students; (2) develop transitional core programs allowing undecided students to explore  career possibilities in the Mountain Oriented Occupations and Health Related Occupations. The report also explained the curriculum development techniques utilized by the project. Covering fire science, forest technology, and heavy equipment maintenance, 92 behavioral objectives were given. Of these, 51 were core content for all 3 areas. These objectives were then evaluated for strengths and weaknesses, using reports submitted by the instructors. Additionally, subjects, purposes, and teaching patterns were given for hospital building maintenance and health occupations to both interest and motivate students. (EE/KM)",

Research concentrated on community and library based information services. The overall recommendation of the document was that Survival Information Centers (SICs) be established in all major rural communities with larger farmworker populations. To effectively meet community needs, these centers must be independent of growers, and must be guided by the farmworkers themselves. The document also presented the migrants' perspective of existing libraries and their need for usually unavailable immediate and frequently bilingual information. An investigation of libraries'  perspectives of services they offer revealed that services directed specifically toward migrants is almost nonexistent. Generally, information needs are filled by the crew boss, work contractor, or union. General library priorities for establishing SICs are given, along with a model. Evaluaton criteria for SICs listed the primary goal as that of developing an awareness and a concurrently increasing demand for information within the community. (KM)",

Nearly 2/3 of the homes had at least 1 member who had a disability or employment handicap. Physical examinations showed that dental problems were the leading cause. Family members aged 25 and over had received a median of 9 years of schooling. The median age of members, 21.4, was about 4 years lower than that for the state's farm population as a whole. Three-fourths of the families had an income of  less than $2,000 a year. Eighty-seven percent of the male household heads were farmers. The contact agency mentioned most frequently by client families prior to involvement with the RFFR project was the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. After association with this project, the agricultural county extension agent had the greatest number of contacts on referral by program aides. Referrals to the RFFR project were successfully rehabilitated and placed in employment in 32 percent of the cases. (Author)",

        "description":"The intention of this paper was to inform readers about educating Native Americans and what could be done to better meet the Indians' needs. To present this, the paper covered the history of Indian education, the present, and the future. Indians were initially educated to force them to change, assimilate, and become acculturized, rather than to learn. For example, the Indian has been told by non-Indians what to do, when to do it, how to do it, and where to go. In the year of 1568, Louis XIV stipulated that the Jesuits educate Indian children in the French manner. The Franciscans assembled the Indians around their missions and taught practical, life-sustaining skills such as farming. At the end of the 19th century, the Federal boarding school system was inagurated. This policy  separated the child from his family and tribe. State involvement in Indian education began with the passage of the 1934 Johnson O'Malley Act and was later followed by other Federal programs--e.g., Public Law 874. All 3 philosophies directed themselves towards anglicizing the Indian, gearing the curriculum to middle class American society. For the future, Indian parents, as a screening committee, must look critically at the textbooks used in the school. The materials and textbooks used must reflect cultural diversity, and must emphasize the positiveness of Indian contributions to this country. Indian cultural integrity must be preserved. The tragedy that the Indian student has experienced educationally must be discontinued. (FF)",

The section on Rural Populations covers rural Appalachia, American Indians, the Spanish speaking, and migrants. The Education chapter discusses ABE, Adult Education Manpower Development, indigenous personnel, curriculum, ABE delivery, community education, and media. Major recommendations are that, to alleviate economic and social distress in rural areas, adult education for these populations needs to be improved; and that the broader method of community education, which subsumes adult education, needs to be developed.

Two approaches were used to measure the relative quality of educational systems: (1) the direct or output approach, and (2) the indirect or input approach. Data reviewed in this report provided a comparison of the results of the 2 approaches. Most of the data was assembled for the 1965-66 school year, and included 601 state school districts. On the average the urban administrators, teachers, librarians, and counselors were better trained than those in rural districts. This is to be expected since the urban districts generally pay higher salaries. Urban  high schools offered a much larger number of courses to their pupils than did rural schools, especially in the prevocational, vocational, natural and social sciences, and fine arts fields. The curricula of the smaller rural high schools tended to be drab and monotonous, providing few electives for individual students. The quality of education, as indicated by average test scores, varied directly with size of the school system; that is, the larger the enrollment, the higher the quality of education, as measured by both input and output data.

The information memory model in connection with various research schools is expositorily discussed, including the causal mechanistic and behavioristic approaches. A combination of the psychological and \"artificial intelligence\" theories and a quantitatively defined structure of the experiment information are the main concerns of the model as developed at Pittsburgh. Normal human behaviors are considered to be Markovian when treated as  a sequence of subjects' behaviors in learning tasks. Experimental studies of nine of twenty principles underlying the development of the model are described in this volume, primarily on a nonparametric basis. Some of the topics covered are memory processes, information flow, intelligence and achievement measurements, task processing strategies, mental maturation, perceptive modalities, concrete and formal operations, and learning and cognition in sorting tasks. Four contributed papers are included to summarize the treatment techniques used. (CC)",

        "description":"Supplementing a television video tape series for environmental understanding, this manual offers a coordinated series of action and information presentations on the need for environmental change. Designed to present realities of action that man may take anywhere in the world to help preserve the limited resources of this planet, the series has drawn on the thoughts and advice of many concerned ecologists and economic specialists. Numerous aspects of individual, corporate, and governmental impact on the quality of the total environment are examined. Focusing on man as a part of the environment rather than apart from it, the emphasis is on the environmental impact, good and bad, of man's interaction with nature and what the cost is, whether it be pollution, trade-off, or benefit.  Twenty-two units have been developed to consider these environmental problems, solutions, and evaluations. Each unit begins with a perspective of the problem or situation followed by a summary of the broadcast information. To encourage personal action and involvement, many suggestions are given in a section entitled \"What can I do?\" Completing each unit are listings of books, articles, films, and organizations as sources for further information. This publication is an expanded version of ED 068 338. (JR)",

The program accomplishments are found to fall short in terms of assisting applicants in finding jobs and of providing financial assistance to participants. Factors adversely affecting accomplishment of programs include insufficient job development and placement assistance, failure to provide follow-up efforts, and inadequate monitoring. The reluctance of former aerospace employees to abandon the hope of a resurgence of industry and its well-paying jobs or to move from  the areas where major aerospace firms are located are among the problems encountered by the program.

The audio-tutorial component insured that students who had reading problems could make use of the individualized instruction The program freed the teacher to work with students individually and prepare for whole-class activities. The program's success was assessed by measuring achievement on standardized pre- and posttests, and comparing the results with results from regular classrooms. The differences on achievement gain between  the two groups were significant at the .01 level for tests on arithmetic computation, arithmetic concepts, arithmetic applications and symbols and vocabulary; all differences favored the individualized instruction group. A cost-accounting comparison indicated little monetary difference. Complete statistical data and budget costs are included. This work was prepared under an ESEA Title III contract. (JP)",

Thus reflected is the fluidity of definition currently characterizing environmental education, as well as differences in levels of support accorded by various agencies in diversified places. Information accompanying each entry outlines the following: project title, director's name and address, headquarters location and facilities available, principal staff, project history, present commercial  affiliations, project objectives, materials produced, materials available free of charge, materials for purchase, additional materials being developed, project implementation, teacher preparation, project evaluation, summary of activities since 1969, plans for the future, and materials available through the ERIC system. Entries are arranged alphabetically by state. In a separate volume (SE 017 299), appendices provide information relating to state coordinators for environmental education, and those projects and programs which sent brief responses or did not respond to the survey questionnaire.

Field research is being done in three New York area high schools, urban, suburban, and rural, by anthropological teams living in the community and participating in the school who are compiling ethnographic records and are meeting to compare data and to  establish an analytic framework for that comparison based on categories native to the data. By the end of the first phase of this research ethnographic records are expected to be completed and a conceptual framework and working methodology established, leading to a preliminary description of basic social behavioral structures in American high schools.

The major portion of the statement focuses on internal processes of responsibility and external processes of responsiveness. Departmental strategies, a planning cycle, an operational planning system, involvement of people, and increased flexibility are suggested to improve decision making. The role of research and development, evaluation, and cost benefit considerations also relate to internal processes. The HEW role in responsiveness starts with cutting away red tape, grant consolidation, services integration, and decentralization. Steps to encourage change include technical assistance in the proposed renewal strategy of the Office of  Education and improved communications in the public affairs management system. As a department of the people, the HEW role in exercising leadership in the national effort to promote human dignity is realized. Concluding remarks identify a fourfold task: to identify problems of people and institutions; to eliminate gaps between promise and performance; to make the best of limited resources; and to fight for additional resources.

Three pause-deleted versions of a 1540-word spoken message read at 164 words per minute (wpm) were prepared. The first version deleted all inter-lexical pauses occurring at significant Immediate Constituent boundaries. The second version deleted inter-lexical pauses corresponding to Deep Structure Analogue breaks. The third deleted all inter-lexical pauses of 50 milliseconds or greater duration. These three recordings, plus a control condition with pauses intact, were differentially time-compressed to six target rates from 225 to 350 wpm. A total of 168 college students served as subjects. The subjects listened to one of the 24  experimental conditions and subsequently took a 55-item comprehension test. Results of this experiment and an additional replication of the experiment involving 192 college students failed to confirm any significant differences between pause and non-pause-deleted conditions. These results were interpreted as disconfirming a two-stage model of speech perception and comprehension. (Author/WR)",

        "description":"Simulation, defined as a representational model of a particular theory, has been the subject of some research in the communication field, but there has been little material published on the uses of simulation as a research tool. Simulations are considered helpful in closing gaps between field studies and laboratory research, serving to increase coherence and consolidate theories. A simulation will be representative of the theory it serves only to the extent that it fits a well-constructed, representative model and accounts for the interaction of variables consistent with the theory. If data from a simulation do not support the hypotheses of the theory, either the hypotheses or the simulation should be adjusted according to the experimenter's goals and his degree of objectivity.  The validity of simulation must be tested for specific objectives. Many simulations are more correctly identified as games or metaphorical extensions of man's social behavior. Important considerations in the use of games as simulations include control of game behavior consistent with the reference system, proper introduction of subjects to the game activity, and determination of whether or not role playing behavior best serves the game.

        "description":"Scholars agree that listening is an active rather than a passive process. The listening which makes people achieve higher scores on current listening tests is \"second speaker\" listening or active participation in the encoding of the message. Most of the instructional suggestions in listening curriculum guides are based on this concept. In terms of a communication model, instead of a process in which one member of a system passively decodes the message while the other encodes, \"second speaker\" listening refers to both members encoding the same message at the same time. Thus, the process of effective listening has been properly called decoding. Becoming the \"second speaker\" requires background information about the subject listened to, motivation to listen, and organizational  skill. A direct approach to teaching decoding has not yet been developed, although instruction in several dimensions of decoding has proved helpful. Improvement in listening instruction requires innovative strategies and rigorous research for results. Until these developments occur, listening will continue as a neglected area of the communication curriculum. (EE)",

        "description":"Despite large rural areas, the United States is basically an urban nation, particularly since the extensiveness and variety of communication networks, rather than open spaces, determine the true degree of urbanization of a region or community. A region is urban to the extent that its interpersonal and media channels are developed. The metropolitan city, with its diverse groups of people, occupations, and ideologies, is urban only if these diversities are interrelated and interdependent through communication networks. An individual's urbanism is determined by the degree to which he participates in and responds to communication messages. American cities are becoming increasingly \"de-urbanized,\" not only because of departures of businesses and families, but also because of the  insularity and isolation of those who remain. This isolation is caused largely by feelings of instability and insecurity. The great problem of cities is to increase public participation in the communication networks. The city colleges can play a major role, with their unique opportunities to provide a more urban outlook to their students through varied curricula and adult education programs. (RN)",

One relatively new form of organization design is the \"task force\" or \"project team\" which is assigned to one specific short-term program, after which the team is dissolved and its members reassigned. A study of a project team in a research consultant organization was conducted in order to analyze its structure and methods of communication. Information from a questionnaire distributed to team members indicated, first, that they consider superior-subordinate relationships to exist for administrative purposes only and on a temporary basis, and, second, that decisions are made by both project leaders and individuals. Most of the interpersonal communication is by  one-to-one conversations. The most important factors that \"facilitate\" their work are job autonomy (freedom from rigid supervision and freedom to make one's own decisions) and the availability of consultation and information exchange. However, a few team members felt that a lack of direction and control was a hindering factor, along with a lack of information about the project. These results indicate that in order to operate effectively a project team must allow its members to make decisions and conduct their own operations but must still provide a coordinator to insure the proper flow of information.

A more pragmatic definition of evidence should be that it covers anything that influences the outcome of a debate or a trial, including such factors as a speaker's appearance, his manner of presentation, and his persuasive tactics other than use of facts, testimony, or documentation. The outcome can depend also on the attitudes of the judge or  jury and their interpretation of the material presented.

After completing dogmatism tests, 20 prisoner subjects were assigned to pairs, according to test scores, for the creative alternative game. Results of the 37 game trials supported the assumption that &quot;low dogmatic&quot; pairs would arrive at more &quot;creative&quot; solutions than &quot;high dogmatic&quot; pairs. Comparison of the prisoner results with those of the four college experiments indicated that the  percentage of cooperative responses were similar in both groups, &quot;low dogmatic&quot; pairs in both groups tended to behave much the same, but &quot;high dogmatic&quot; pairs in the prison group tended to play more cooperatively than in the college samples.

These measurements give some indication of the communicative effectiveness of a media message, but, in the case of mass music, attention and retention are low among its users despite the high popularity of the music.

        "description":"Because of outside pressures, interscholastic debate is currently experiencing a period of criticism and self-examination, a factor which should cause debate directors to seek innovations in their programs. The best opportunities for experimentation are at workshops and summer institutes. One suggestion is that teams be given options in alloting their time, depending on whether they wish to give more emphasis to refutation or to constructive speeches. Immediate feedback could be provided to the debaters if the judge were to indicate at certain moments during a debate round, using a scorecard, how individual speakers are being rated. Judges should also be allowed to give tie decisions when the teams are so closely matched that a definitive decision is difficult to make. Finally,  there could be an interruption system, so that an opponent or judge could stop a speaker for questions about material just presented. These are examples of innovations that should be subjected to workshop experiments. (RN)",

Berger's scale has a male bias, but other factors proved reliable, leading to the conclusion that, with a control factor for sex, the Berger scale is a valuable instrument in communication research because of its focus on verbal behavior. For example, Berger's  finding that the expression of a positive self-concept usually indicates a high degree of acceptance of others was found reliable. (CH)",

First, communication of \"action,\" a one-way approach, is a type of \"cybernetic\" theory of communication involving observation and experience in developing patterns of communication performance. It is simplistic, has a weak capacity for replication of certain situations, and has a limited ability for generalizing observations. The second perspective, \"interaction,\" a \"merger of self and other\" with \"a complete ability to anticipate, predict and behave with the joint needs of self and other,\" is advantageous since it allows communication theories to be tested in controlled and repeated situations. The third approach, \"transaction,\" has been employed in at least four different  contexts: (1) the philosophical view of the \"complete communication system\" (Dewey and Bentley); (2) the perception of persons and objects (Ittelson and Cantril); (3) the exchange of interpersonal goods and services (Bauer); and (4) the analysis of relationships in the psychotherapeutic situation (Berne). \"Transaction\" shows increased popularity, especially in various therapy treatments.

Experimental studies involving over 400 undergraduates at the University of Nebraska sought to determine the way subjects in groups of different levels of intelligence judge a neutral message and the personality of the speaker based on a positive paralinguistic structure. Results showed that there were no significant differences among the groups in rating the topic, but a difference was observed in the way each group evaluated the speaker's personality. A possibility exists that subjects of superior intellect, in paying less  attention to the paralinguistic message, tend to listen more critically to the linguistic message and use the message to rate the speaker. However, since grade point averages were the only criterion for classifying intelligence, it is possible that the data may be incomplete and that more complex research is needed. (DS)",

Results should lead to a full understanding of covert responses and to a greater comprehension of gross behaviors. Physiological measurement tests skin conductance, heart rate, muscle tension, blood volume, and the electrical activity of the brain. Studies done by Westie and DeFleur tested emotional responses of student attitudes toward Negroes, while others' experiments recorded skin responses to stimulus words, to certain films, and to information-loaded  sentences and studied anxiety during public speaking, physiological interaction in small groups, and autonomic measures of stress under pressures of group conformity.

Two interacting communication subsystems are the demands placed on the individual by the urban community and the demands placed on the system by the individual. Suggested topics for communication behavior studies include: the effect of infringement of personal space on communication patterns within and between living units, the relationship between increasing population density  and responsibility for one's personal verbal behavior, and the effects of increased needs for public transportation on the persuasiveness of messages relating to transportation use.

Rather than additional \"response\" studies, which investigate the impact of media on behavior or a society's impact on its media, more research should center on the functions of mass media within the overall framework of communication theory. As one of the variables in the total process of communication, any mass medium is both an extension of man's receptive senses and his communicating capabilities. Source credibility, an important consideration in a public speaking situation, is of special importance in the mass communication situation because of the high credibility of the medium itself and its ability to create or destroy a speaker's credibility. Also, medium salience  is important, as well as topic salience, in determining an individual's response to a message. A mass communication theory is incomplete if it is based solely on effect or receiver response with no consideration of media functions or roles within overall communication networks. (RN)",

But do listeners perceive equivocation, and what effect does equivocation have, especially negatively worded sentences, on source credibility? More than 60 undergraduates at the University of Oklahoma were subjects in a test of this question. Results show that (1) listeners' prior attitudes determine if the message is interpreted as being vague; (2) no significant differences were found between (a) agreement with a message and the order of the  equivocated and clearly stated issues as well as (b) all issues being stated positively or all issues being stated negatively; (3) source credibility is not significantly affected by order of presenting equivocated issues; and (4) there is greater recall if all the issues are presented positively.

Students were randomly assigned to one of twelve discussion groups of five members each. The topic and materials for discussion were excerpted from the local student newspaper and authenticated. Typical group behavior roles were assigned which would represent varied opinions. A nine-item semantic differential test was selected as the measurement of consensus. The resulting data demonstrated that there are no significant differences between means of scores on a test of consensus between groups with assigned roles and groups without assigned roles. In a group discussion where participants are  labeled, the behavior is standardized, and it is more difficult to reach a consensus unless group members become accustomed to their roles. (DS)",

The lawyer-persuader, however, does not have unlimited choice since he is bound by legal rules and constraints. Therefore, the rhetorical critic must at least be aware of the legal constraints before he can criticize lawyers' choices and persuasive methods. Courtroom atmospheres, settings, and traditions, as well as laws and set procedures, impose rhetorical restrictions. Some recently published articles on the communication process and on forensics indicated an awareness among scholars of the possibilities that unique courtroom situations offer  for further communication research.

Authors of Readers Theater materials are advised to use aesthetic factors inherent in the literature itself, supplemented by presentational rather than representational production factors, to guide audiences into their role as mental participants in the stage events. Further, technical effects should be limited to those possible in small conventional theaters such as are in most communities. Directors of Readers Theater productions should be aware that a presentation time of one hour or less seems most effective and that the more  theatrical effects of sound and dramatic lighting, movement, and dress can be used to enhance audience appeal. The focus of presentations should always be toward the audience and to its horizontal center. Research into increasing the audience appeal of Readers Theater should be carried beyond present levels.

Factor analysis, which might be considered a first step in multivariate analysis, can generate factors in speech communication studies for use as dependent variables as demonstrated through an example of the effects of seating arrangements on persuasion. An example of research on communication denial as a cause of alienation in a small group illustrates that multivariate analysis of variance might yield significant results where separate analysis of variance would not. Multivariate statistical approaches enhance opportunities for new studies or reevaluations of old studies in areas such as attitude change and small group  communication because they yield more precise analyses of data.

Speech communication programs can ge presented in precise instructional modules which are of particular value to the career education specialists. A program can best be developed by outlining descriptions of communication demands in specific occupations. The communication educator could then identify communication behaviors for each occupational role, indicate conditions under which  they would be enacted, specify the relative importance of communication behaviors, and provide instructional modules suitable for each individual and his career goals. This role-context approach offers many possibilities for integrating a speech communication program into career education. (RN)",

Future research in this area should be directed at how organizations, not individuals, use communication (through mass media, pressure groups, community groups, etc.) to control the direction of change.
