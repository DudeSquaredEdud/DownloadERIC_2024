        "description":"This book of readings was developed to increase the reader's awareness of the cultural and social issues which face children and their counselors. It draws attention to environmental factors which impinge on both teaching and counseling techniques, and encourages counselors to re-examine their roles and interventions for the 1990s. The readings show counselors in elementary schools how to help children grow and develop in a changing world. Each chapter of the book contains articles that have been published in counseling journals during the 1980s. Each chapter begins with an introduction by the editors and concludes with a set of issues designed to stimulate thinking about the current state of elementary school counseling. Individual chapters focus on: (1) cultural diversity; (2)  changing families; (3) drug abuse; (4) child abuse and neglect; (5) exceptional children; (6) technology; (7) the changing world of work; (8) learning in a changing world; (9) children's behavior in a changing world; and (10) human relations.

        "description":"Due to the high cost of professional services for the emotionally disturbed it is often the case that community-based aftercare programs for this population rely heavily on the use of volunteers to provide direct supportive functions. This study used a structured interview to attempt to describe the perceptions of volunteers of the informal helping relationship in a community-based aftercare program for the emotionally disturbed. The participants were 18 volunteer informal helpers. The results of the interview were in accordance with expectations, and are almost identical to prescriptions of the helping role found in the social support literature. The majority of the volunteers were in the program from between 4 months to 1 year; there was not, therefore, much difference between  the participants based on length of time in the program. All of the volunteers found out about the program through a radio or newspaper ad that appealed to them personally. For the most part the volunteers perceived their role in a way that was consistent with the expectations that society, the service delivery system, and their helpees would hold for them. All of the participants described themselves as having one of the following traits: empathy, warmness, sensitivity, or helpfulness. More elaborate descriptive findings are needed regarding the helping relationship. (Author/ABL)",

Following a short review of the history of retention, the paper reviews the literature on the effectiveness of retention, then addresses the issue of retention as a means of maintaining the integrity of the curriculum. It also considers the use of standardized tests or locally developed tests as important elements of promotion standards, and the reliability and validity of letter grades or marks, which provide the professional judgment on which  retention may be based. The conclusion is drawn that retention in grade has virtually no benefits for the pupils retained, their classmates, their teachers, or their schools. References are included. (Author/TE)",

After three sessions and also at the end of the sessions, clients' judgments of their therapists' expertise, attractiveness, and trustworthiness were assessed with the Counselor Rating Form (CRF) and their judgments of therapists' empathy, regard, and congruence were assessed by means of the Relationship Inventory (RI). Four measures of client anxiety were administered before and after  treatment.

The project involves interdisciplinary collaboration between students and faculty from social work, psychology, nursing, education, criminal justice, public health, law, and medicine. A unique aspect of the USC project has been the development of an assessment clinic for providing comprehensive multidisciplinary evaluations of maltreated children and families. In this project the clinical psychology supervisor is part of the assessment team and assists directly in guiding the multidisciplinary process  as needed. The supervisor also meets with the psychology students individually and as a group to provide direct teaching and supervision of psychology training. Students need a strong theoretical background in normal child development before they can understand maltreatment. Issues such as maltreatment require a multidisciplinary approach in university settings. By exposing bright and concerned graduate students early in their professional development to questions about how children cope with maltreatment, what treatment approaches help, what placement alternatives work best, and how to prevent future maltreatment, research and applied programs will be stimulated.

This study is concerned with how aggression and social withdrawal are related to criminal activity approximately 10 years after individuals were initially identified. Further, this study examined whether academic achievement provides supplementary or overlapping prediction of crime to that provided by knowledge about social behavior. Information was collected for boys and girls (N=1,704) in grade 7 (time one) about aggression, withdrawal, and academic achievement. Based on their scores, students were divided into aggressive, withdrawn, aggressive-withdrawn, and control groups. Adult criminal  activity was assessed 10 years after first assessment (time two). Men who had been aggressive were four times more likely than control males to have committed a crime, and they committed crimes more frequently. As a group, women committed few crimes, and even women who had been aggressive were unlikely to commit crimes. Knowledge about social behavior in early adolescence was a more potent predictor of number and seriousness of crimes than knowledge about academic achievment. (ABL)",

This study examined the differential relationship between perceived mate availability and aggregate assessments of sex-ratio in broadly distinctive socio-cultural groupings to determine whether the primary theoretical conceptualizations concerning the role of mate availability are differentially relevant for those groups. One-half of the contents of the 1989 Southern California Social Survey (SCSS) was devoted to the issue of mate availability and its attitudinal and psychological correlates. The sample consisted of adults (N=1,116) with Blacks and Latinos oversampled to provide numbers sufficient for analytical purposes. Two indicators of perceived mate availability were used: perceived  availability of the opposite sex and perceived sex ratio. A series of items concerning factors considered by the respondent to be important for a successful marriage were asked. The results suggest that the roots of African American marital decline are more likely to be structural, rather than the result of the devaluing of the institution of marriage. Economic as well as demographic indicators were salient for Blacks. Although multivariate analysis did not provide support for the primacy of economic indicators for Latino marital behavior and expectations, the bivariate comparisons indicated a very dominant male concern with economic readiness for marriage.

This study examined the relationship between perceived marital opportunity and psychological well-being, as measured by depression, anxiety, loneliness, life satisfaction, and relationship satisfaction, using women's data from the 1989 Southern California Social Survey. Data from approximately 300 single women were included. Partial correlations between mate availability and well-being indicators, controlling for age, income, education, and value placed on marriage demonstrated  that perceptions of mate availability were significantly and negatively correlated with well-being. A perceived lack of availability was associated with greater depression, anxiety, loneliness, and less satisfaction with life. The effect was strong and pervasive for Latino women and White women, but somewhat weak for Black women. Findings were interpreted as indicating that when the perception of mate availability was viewed as rooted and driven, the consequences for psychological well-being were negative. When mate availability was viewed as a systemic feature of the environment over which one had little control, mental health was not affected. (ABL)",

This study takes the societal phenomenon of sex ratio imbalance as context, but focuses on the social psychological impact of perceived mate availability. One-half the contents of the 1989 Southern California Social Survey was devoted to the issue of mate availability and its attitudinal and psychological correlates. Subjects (N=1,116) were adults, with Blacks and Latinos oversampled. Two indicators of perceived mate availability were ascertained: availability of opposite sex and sex ratio. The results indicated that each of the groups could be classified in terms of perceived opposite sex availability: Black women were in a situation of severe undersupply; Black men in great oversupply; Latino  women in relative undersupply; Latino and White men in relative balance. For most groups the perception was a relative reflection of the actual situation. The White female situation was a bit more ambiguous. In terms of actual sex ratio, White women were far more advantaged than Black women, but perceived their situation to be one of male shortage. The root of this perception may be more reflective of gender role issues than structural conditions. (ABL)",

        "description":"Only recently have mental health professionals realized the importance and impact of death and death anxiety in the lives of individuals, particularly clients. Indeed few empirical studies have examined the levels of death anxiety among clients, much less among counselors or counselors-in-training. The purpose of this study was to examine whether gender, age, and experience with death and/or suicide would influence reported levels of death anxiety, manifest anxiety, and attitudes toward suicide among counselors-in-training (N=55). Significant differences were found between male and female trainees in levels of death anxiety, with females reporting higher levels. When attitudes toward suicide were examined, trainees who had had a direct experience with a friend or family member  attempting or committing suicide had a more negative view of the acceptability of suicide than did those without this direct experience. No differences were found between male and female trainees in suicide attitude and manifest anxiety. A possible way to begin dealing with the death anxiety and attitudes toward suicide experienced by counselors-in-training is through educational exposure, specifically with death and dying and the various aspects of suicide. Regardless of the method, the topics of death, dying, and suicide need to be integrated into existing counselor training programs. (ABL)",

The purpose of this study was to provide a description of the adolescent children who have lived with Vietnam combat veteran fathers, comparing them (on the basis of social and personal adjustment, relationship with their parents, personality development, and a few personal choices and opinions) with a control group of children whose fathers were not in Vietnam. The experimental group, consisting of 14 girls and 14 boys from a high school in West Virginia, and a control group of equal size, age, and gender were compared on grade point average, school absences, achievement test scores, the Behavior Rating Profile, the  Beck Depression Inventory, the Child's Attitude Toward Father and Mother, the High School Personality Questionnaire, and a demographic questionnaire. The results indicated that the children of combat veterans were significantly more troubled. More specific information concerning the child's perceptions of the problem areas and family dynamics would be particularly valuable. Just as their fathers deserve special recognition for the sacrifices which they have made, so their children are entitled to careful observation to detect possible impairment and a more comprehensive investigation into the issue of secondary traumatization.

Teacher's guides, student texts, and workbooks of nine popular basal reader series were examined to ascertain whether they offered a clear definition of the term &quot;prefix&quot; and whether that definition was reinforced by the use of correct exemplars. The series examined were published by D.C. Heath; Harcourt-Brace-Jovanovich; Holt Rinehart and Winston; Houghton Mifflin; Macmillan; McGraw-Hill; Open Court; Scott Foresman; and Silver-Burdett and Ginn. Results showed that confusion exists in the definition of &quot;prefix&quot; and that this confusion is frequently compounded by the use of exemplars which mix prefixed words with words with etymological elements which are  therefore noncomposite in English.

        "author":["Jimenez, Robert T."],
        "description":"Contrary to common wisdom, the authorities of Colonial Mexico (1521-1600) were vitally concerned with the teaching of reading to the indigenous people. Alphabetic literacy was introduced in Mexico with the coming of the Franciscan friars, who brought with them many innovations and heartily set about the task of education. Some of the friars' innovations included using the Indians' hieroglyphic picture writing and transcribing the Nahuatl language into Roman letters. Fray Pedro de Gante wrote a trilingual primer (published in 1569) and thus pioneered the use of vernacular language in education. The teaching and learning of reading and writing seems to have flourished under these conditions. Later, the teaching of literacy became fossilized in an unchanging text that was used  almost exclusively, with only minor changes, for two centuries. Literacy always had a definite purpose in Mexico--to perpetuate the system of government in power and to convert the native population to Catholicism. The decline of education in Mexico can be accounted for by opposition from Spanish colonists to education of the indigenous population, and to the cutting off of adequate funding for education.

        "description":"Even though reading is a complex process, cognitive psychologists generally agree that reading is an active thinking process. Four aspects of the interactive view of reading can help define this process: (1) readers use both what they know and information from the text to construct meaning; (2) readers elaborate what and how they read; (3) readers continually monitor their understanding to see if it makes sense; and (4) readers use the situational context to focus their purposes and frame their attitude toward the literacy event. The interactive model of reading can form a framework for analyzing reading difficulty. Reading difficulty occurs when one of the aspects of the reading process is excluded for an extended period of time. When there is a mismatch between the students'  reading behaviors and reading instruction, readers use compensatory strategies to construct meaning. With each of the four aspects of the interactive model of reading, reasons for reading difficulty can be explained in terms of an interaction between student behaviors and classroom instruction, thus illustrating the powerful influence teachers and schooling have on remedial reading.

        "description":"Intended to serve as a resource for the many and varied groups concerned with improving students' reading proficiencies, this report from the Nation's Report Card provides a long-term perspective on students' reading skills and strategies based on a series of five national assessments conducted from 1971 to 1988. Each chapter of the report provides a different perspective on trends in students' reading abilities. The first chapter describes changes in the average reading performance of 9-, 13-, and 17-year-olds across the five reading trend assessments conducted by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) between 1971 and 1988. The second chapter defines levels of reading proficiency and presents the percentages of students attaining these successive levels in each  assessment. The third chapter summarizes trends in students' responses to questions on their reading instruction and experiences and investigates the relationships between these background factors and reading proficiency. Overall, the findings described in the report reveal generally positive but subtle changes in reading performance at the national level since 1971: (1) nine-year-olds assessed in 1988 read significantly better than their counterparts assessed in 1971, but this progress was made in the 1970s; (2) thirteen-year-olds' reading achievement has fluctuated slightly over the years; and (3) seventeen-year-old students assessed in 1988 read significantly better than their counterparts assessed in either 1971 or 1975.

        "description":"A study examined th phonics instruction that five basal reader series provide from kindergarten through grade six. The five basal programs (designated as Series A through E) that were examined are both similar and dissimilar in the recommendations they make for phonics. One series covers as many as 129 letter-sound correspondences; another covers 87. All five series pay considerable attention to consonant sounds in their kindergarten manuals and to numerous ways to spell long vowel sounds. Two of the five series deal with blending as a means for identifying words; another uses blending to emphasize whatever sound is receiving attention. Either way, the blending is done mostly by the teacher, not the children. The other two programs, neither of which identifies sounds directly, do  not refer to blending. An omission in all five series is suggestions for teaching children how to use letter-sound correspondences with flexibility. Four of the five series teach a few generalizations for dividing words into syllables; the fifth series omits generalizations for syllabication. All five programs fail to deal with phonics in a way that makes its value for reading apparent to children. Instead, the programs succeed in demonstrating how phonics instruction can be a waste of time. Findings reveal the wide gap that exists between the phonics that is taught and the recommendations that are made for dealing with new vocabulary.

Fewer students reported using the think-aloud strategy out of school, with no significant differences among groups for  transfer of the strategy to non-school situations. Results indicated significant differences among groups for use of the strategy in school, with the active and fullrange modeling groups reporting significantly more transfer situations. These students also had a greater percentage of responses than the passive group when asked &quot;How has the think-aloud helped you?&quot; They commented on how it helped them understand what they were reading and how it helped them deal with confusions that arose during reading.

        "description":"A study examined reading performance, metacognitive knowledge about reading, awareness of the conventions about print, perceptions of reading ability, and causal attributions for success and failure in reading of children with reading difficulties in Year 2 in Australia. One hundred children from the Brisbane region were involved in the study--half with reading difficulties. Children were tested individually on three separate occasions at approximately 2-month intervals. Results indicated that children with reading difficulties were less able to identify letters and words when compared to their peers. They also had lower reading ages for reading accuracy and comprehension than the children without reading difficulties. Children with reading difficulties showed less awareness of  the concepts about printed language than their peers. Self-beliefs and causal attributions indicated that the children with reading difficulties perceived their attainment to be higher than their actual achievement might indicate. In accounting for their failure in reading, children with reading difficulties made reference to a lack of ability and to being unlucky.

        "description":"A study examined whether the higher-order thinking patterns elicited by a reader response approach would carry over and become part of students' ways of thinking about literature, even in the absence of reader response prompts. Subjects were fourth-grade students (48 in all) in two intact, heterogeneously grouped classrooms in the same elementary school in a medium-sized, middle-class, southwestern community. Both teachers carried out the same reading curriculum: a basal reading program; a literature strand using whole-class sets of tradebooks; a schoolwide storytelling program; and independent reading of self-selected books. As a pretest and posttest, students wrote for 5 minutes to the nonreader response prompt, \"Tell me about your book.\" Over a 12-week period, one teacher  proceeded with the regular reading program. The other teacher used reader response prompts in classroom activities approximately twice a week as students read, talked, and wrote about what they had read. Pretest results showed that control and experimental groups evidenced similar concrete, literal thought patterns (using categories developed by Arthur Applebee and based on Piagetian categories of cognitive development). Posttest results showed significant differences between the two groups: while the control group remained fairly consistent with earlier results, the experimental group showed significantly more evidence of higher-order thinking (specifically, Applebee's Category 3--analysis).

The aim of the project is to counteract the intergenerational effects of illiteracy. The courseware runs on an Apple IIe microcomputer and is interactive, branching, and responsive to the user's answers and needs. The objectives for the 1986-87 fiscal year were: (1) summative evaluation and monitoring of the courseware in parent literacy sites; (2) revision of the teacher's manual to include various models for using the courseware in parent literacy sites; (3) further development of teaching activities to facilitate the transfer of words  recognized on a computer screen to recognition in print; and (4) completion of the interactive audiodisk version with formative evaluation in sites serving non-native speakers. In meeting the first objective, a group of parents and their children participated in the program. Comparison of pretests and posttests indicated that the 52 parents completing 20 hours of instructional time gained more than 1 year in reading level, compared to at least 50 hours of instructional time to make comparable gains in traditional programs. The remaining three objectives were met. Teachers in the program have noted significant attitudinal shifts in both parents and children. (RS)",

Whole Language is not a method of teaching, nor is it a program; it is a philosophy or viewpoint. Nine major characteristics of a Whole Language approach as culled from a variety of sources, with most agreed upon by a majority of authors, are: (1) fun in reading; (2) oral language as a bridge to print; (3) risk taking; (4) use of rich literature; (5) developmental versus preconceived sequence; (6) integrating the language arts; (7) reading whole texts versus excerpts; (8) meaningful use of language versus isolated drill; and (9) reading is a natural act. While bits and pieces of method associated with the philosophy have been supported by research, little research has been  done on the total. Educators are obviously in a state of flux. Educators must make every effort to ensure that the effective elements are here to stay, especially: the encouragement to modify curriculum to fit kids instead of trying to fit kids into preconceived molds; the emphasis on children doing a lot more real reading and writing; and the practice of children doing both reading and writing as communicative acts rather than devoting the majority of time to skill exercises. If children are to become independent readers, the skills they do learn need to be used in real reading. Educators need to recognize that both skill and interest are essential.

The program's two major goals were to develop and provide CLEAR-RR for the first grade pupils and to adapt and apply the inservice program for teachers. Specially trained teachers provided one-on-one half-hour daily lessons during the school year. Pupils included in the final pretest-posttest analysis had received 60 or more instructional lessons. Activities included reading and rereading books while the teacher maintained a record of strategies and errors, writing and reading  stories, identifying letters, and analyzing sounds in words. The major evaluation effort was to be accomplished through the administration of the Metropolitan Achievement Tests (MAT6). Due to the inappropriateness of the pretest and posttest levels and incomplete test data for a number of students, caution is advised in reviewing the results of the study. The evaluation sample was comprised of only 104 pupils. Tables are provided for the posttest scores, but no interpretation of the data is undertaken. Findings support continuation of the CLEAR-RR program. (Eight additional recommendations and 23 tables of data are included; survey instruments are attached.) (RS)",

        "description":"A study was designed to provide an initial context for framing the most pressing questions in the teaching of literature. To do this, the teaching of English in the high school classrooms of teachers whose departments were considered excellent by other professionals in education was examined. The issues that emerged in the programs with reputations for excellence should help to define how well current theory and practice in the teaching of literature work, as well as areas that may need further development. The study involved 17 schools in diverse communities throughout the United States. In addition to monitoring classes at each school, the observers interviewed teachers, librarians, and department heads, and collected completed questionnaires from each of these groups. Results  suggest that the emphasis on literature instruction has remained relatively constant since the middle 1960s in programs with reputations for excellence in English. Fifty-two percent of the class time observed was devoted to literature. The emphasis on writing instruction has increased, with instruction now focused on literature 75% of the time. The data gathered serve to highlight a series of important issues that arise in schools where the teachers and the department as a whole have given careful thought and attention to what and how they teach. Four issues which emerged represent the growing edges of current theory and practice; they concern the need to: (1) provide institutional support for literature programs; (2) revitalize literature instruction for nonacademic students; (3)  reconcile approaches to literature with approaches to writing; and (4) develop a theory of learning/teaching literature that will guide the rethinking of high school instruction.

Results indicated that the process of reading literary and non-literary texts is one that involves a four broad recursive stances that the reader takes toward the text: (1) being out and stepping into  an envisionment; (2) being in and moving through an envisionment; (3) stepping back and rethinking what one knows; and (4) stepping out and objectifying the experience.

The question directing the research was: how do the &quot;best&quot; high school English teachers introduce, undertake, and guide the study of literature in their classrooms? The question of the seeming &quot;subjectivity&quot; of teacher inquiry is addressed, and it is argued that while there are real differences of philosophy and method between teacher research and empirical educational inquiry, it is erroneous to suggest that only one of the two can claim reliability. The following features of teacher research are examined in detail:  (1) teacher research presumes that its knowledge is &quot;interpretive&quot; rather than &quot;objective&quot; or &quot;subjective&quot;; (2) teacher research is phenomenological in its aim, not abstractive or generalizing; (3) teacher research views the cultural reality of the classroom from a vantage point within it instead of outside it; and (4) teacher research depends on narrative as its means of articulating what it has come to understand. Based on the results of the six research projects, the report describes some common themes that recurred in the teacher research narratives and suggests their implications. (RS)",

The researcher conducted taped interviews with the teacher and the students, gathered lesson plans, study guidelines, and assignments related to instructional units, and made videotapes of the classes involved. The paper concludes that the classroom observed was both teacher-directed and student-centered: the teacher direction was so skillful as to be almost invisible, and the teacher's organizational skills provided a  classroom environment in which students actively engaged in the process of reading, interpreting, and criticizing texts. It was also observed that the teacher's focus on student-generated responses and questions kept the classroom discussion centered on issues of genuine concern to the readers. (RS)",

Results indicated that 61% of the school systems assess literature as part of an assessment of reading and that the main focus of these assessment programs is on comprehension rather than cultural literacy. The content analysis indicated that a majority of items in proprietary testing programs deal with comprehension of the content of the text rather than any literary aspects such as language, structure, or voice and that tests in commercial anthology series also focus on comprehension. The results also indicated that the one  exception to the overall assessment picture occurred in university placement examinations which contained a higher number of items calling for knowledge of literature and literary skills.

The guide roughly parallels steps in the writing/thinking process--from choosing a topic and conceptualizing a beginning response to revising a final draft. The guide pairs samples of student writing (at various steps in the writing process, and taken from a range of disciplines such as chemistry, anthropology, sociology, political science, and biology) with a corresponding scenario and script of questions a teaching assistant can appropriately ask the student about  his/her writing at that point. The guide's seven sections and the steps they address in the writing process are as follows: (1) To the Teaching Assistant; (2) Getting Started (assignment sheet, \"writer's block,\" and brainstorming doodles); (3) Collecting Information (journal entry, lecture notes, reading, note cards, and lab notes); (4) Developing and Organizing Ideas (matrix, outline, and beginning ramble); (5) Revising a Draft (ESL problems, unclear syntax, unclear diction, choppiness, undigested quotations, and requiring rearrangement and transitions); (6) Test-taking (page from a midterm); and (7) Preventing Plagiarism.

        "description":"The lesbian detective of current fiction may be single, but she is not alone; she has a lover. In varying degrees of realism and fantasy, sexuality is part of her character. While some writers in the field argue that romances involving the protagonists of feminist detective fiction distract from the plot, these critics themselves sometimes break their own rules. Lesbian novels focus on many sex-related concerns; the sleuth is often drawn into the action because a friend or lover needs help, and lovers often work together to combat prejudice. In theory, and in the practice of the best writers, sexuality is not only a major component of characterization but also a statement of humanitarian values and lesbian feminism. The question then is not how sexy the lesbian detective novel  is, but how well it is written and integrated. These novels present positive views of women loving women and provide positive models validating various choices for women. (A 22-item bibliography of lesbian mystery novels is attached.) (SG)",

By using narration with a shifting of narrative voice, Forbes calls into question the validity of the traditional teaching of argumentation. Forbes demonstrates the danger in women's acceptance of the dominant ideology cast in the form of propositions. She also shows how these propositions, buttressed by money, power (in the form of the police), and the institution of marriage can, in effect, cause themselves to become partially true. Although the main conflict in the story seems to be whether one character, Mrs. Atwood, will accept her husband's oppressive general statements, in fact, the story is itself an  argument, and the primary conflict is in the mind of the reader.

Twenty-seven sixth-grade students attended a school in a lower middle-class area close to the campus of the university where the teacher education students were enrolled. Each sixth grade student was paired with a teacher education student. Letters were exchanged weekly from September until December. The effect of writing to a real audience was gauged by comparing the first letters with later letters. Changes of the following kinds were most noticeable: length, syntactic complexity,  paragraphing, and various communicative features (such as: openings and closings, questions, taking up topics, and expressions of appreciation). The education students found the correspondence personally rewarding and learned important things about the writing of sixth graders including an appropriate balance between formal matters and content. For the sixth-graders, the experience was rewarding both personally and as a learning experience as was evident in comments they made in their letter and in journal entries to their teacher. Both the students and their teacher considered writing to their pen pals a highly motivating activity. The sixth-graders were eager to adopt strategies that would help them communicate more clearly and effectively. (Seventeen references are attached.)  (MG)",

Divided into control, mixed, and experimental classes, 281 students in six classes using computers were compared with 231 students in nine classes using paper and pencil and 212 students in nine classes in a mixed treatment, using computers as well as paper-and-pencil. Results showed that a computer was needed for each individual student during every class meeting to maximize the value of using word processing. In the fully computerized treatment, students demonstrated greater use of high-level editing than in  the paper-and-pencil or mixed treatments, and students who used computers developed more positive attitudes toward revision, drafting, and learning to use computers than those who had only brief or no exposure. Results suggested 14 design criteria to weigh in effective computerization of writing classrooms, and writing instruction was most effective in brief, immediately applied &quot;mini-units&quot; rather than in longer lessons. Student work was initially slower and more asynchronous among members of a class, and teaching was most effective using process-based and cooperative learning strategies. Student use of printers was key to increased feedback from others, leading to increased revising and editing of their work. The model illustrates the contributions of computers, printers, lessons, and  learning environment to the development of mature writing skills.

        "description":"Based on two national assessments of the writing proficiency of representative samples of students in grades 4, 8, and 11 conducted during the school years ending in 1984 and 1988, this report assesses the informative, persuasive, and imaginative writing performance of the nation's students and tracks changes in performance over time. The first three chapters of the report describe student performance on the informative, persuasive, and imaginative writing tasks included in the writing trend assessments, based on the results of the primary trait and holistic analyses. The fourth chapter summarizes trends in average task accomplishment for the nation and various demographic subpopulations. In the fifth chapter, trends in students' grammar, punctuation, and spelling are discussed.  The sixth chapter discusses factors that appear to be related to writing performance, such as students' instructional experiences and home environment. The report concludes that despite some progress on some tasks, students' writing performance across tasks remains low and has changed little across time. The report also finds that the extent to which students at all grade levels value writing, use it in their own lives, and engage in writing process activities remains quite limited.

        "description":"Since exploration of thoughts, feelings, attitudes, opinions, and beliefs about Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is crucial to teenagers' ability to develop healthy attitudes and behaviors, and since the language arts classroom is a natural arena for such exploration, this sourcebook presents ideas on how to bring this kind of discussion about AIDS into the 11th- and 12th-grade language arts classroom while continuing to focus on reading, writing, and speaking skills. The sourcebook contains eight major activities (each including an overview, objectives, follow-up assignments, and comments) which can be adapted to an individual teacher's needs or interests and the particular classroom situation. Following an introduction, the eight activities in the sourcebook are as  follows: (1) &quot;The News Journal: Making Current Events Real,&quot; and an example of scheduling; (2) &quot;The Ad Campaign&quot;; (3) &quot;You and Your Community: An Interview&quot;; (4) &quot;The Message in the Media&quot;; (5) &quot;Writing a Poem or Song&quot;; (6) &quot;Writing a Short Story or One Act Play&quot;; (7) &quot;AIDS and Literature&quot;; and (8) &quot;HIV/AIDS and the Writing RCT&quot; (the Regents' Competency Test's written form deals with the writing of a business letter, a report, and a composition). Appendixes contain a student handout on what high school juniors and seniors need to know about HIV/AIDS; an AIDS myth-fact sheet; current information on HIV infection, for teachers; a compendium of teacher vocabulary; a list of New York State regional AIDS education training centers; and a bibliography of books and information sources.

Students in six sections of 10th-grade American literature, inquiry and expression, were chosen as subjects to field test the writing curriculum during year 3 of the project. The treatment represented writing techniques found successful from study and piloting over the first 2 years of the project. The treatment had two different levels of intensity: a single teacher level (97 students) and a team teacher level (50 students). The 1985 national norming group from the  California Achievement Test (CAT) served as the comparison group. Overall, it was found that the writing project produced notable achievement gains in excess of the national norming group in the areas of total reading, language mechanics, language expression, total language, and spelling. Results indicated that the single teacher situation was as good as, and in a couple instances even better than, the team teacher condition. (Three figures and four tables of data are included. Appendixes include components of field testing, graphs of the relative growth indexes, calculations of the relative growth indexes, and comparisons of the number tested for the comparison and experimental groups.)

The computer classroom is not a passive room, one where information goes out from the teacher to passive receptors; it is an active room where the information flows from writer to computer to readers in the room or on the network. Computers in the classroom change the location of authority, directing focus away from the teacher and the chalkboard and onto the screen, onto the text generated on the computer. In this setting, the teacher acts as facilitator, helping the information flow. Finally, computers in the classroom  change the way teachers teach, encouraging veteran teachers to reconsider old ways of teaching composition while they cope with the new technology.

        "description":"Ronald Reagan's rhetorical presidency can be summarized as a leader attempting, at virtually every occasion, to stem the dissolution of the American spirit by celebrating the country's mythic past. Such attempts were Reagan's celebration of nationalism through a particular discussion of the interrelationships between liberty, freedom, democracy, and Providence. Such efforts reveal Reagan's celebration of his own understanding of the country's civil religion. The relationship between the presidency and civil religion is an important one, where the elected official becomes the vehicle for articulating and preserving America's particular mythic understanding of itself. Reagan's presidential discourse was filled with examples of civil religion, such as discussion of sacred origins  and sacred destinies for America, his recounting the deeds of heroic figures, and his definition of democracy. Other presidents have paid homage to that fusion of nationalism and mythology called America's civil religion. However, Reagan's rhetoric concerning civil religion is important for two reasons. First, Reagan was a president who used the elements of civil religion often; they permeated his rhetoric. Second, such epideictic celebrations were not without pragmatic implications, for such rhetoric ran through virtually all of the president's discourse. Ronald Reagan made very consistent and apparently very successful use of various elements of America's civil religion, reminding the people of their &quot;divine legacy&quot; and calling the people to fulfill their &quot;divine destiny.&quot; (Thirty-four  notes are included.)

        "description":"The &quot;Leadership Continuum&quot; model developed in 1961 by R. Tannenbaum, I. Weschler, and F. Massarik clearly illustrates the ideas that management scholars like Frederick Taylor, V. A. Graicunas, James Worthy, Rensis Likert, and Frederick Thayer have posited concerning span of control and organizational structure. Each of these scholars fits at some point on the &quot;leadership continuum&quot; scale. The model (the underlying assumption of which is that leadership is not always centered with the &quot;boss&quot;) provides an important contrast between what scholars thought several years ago versus what they think now, and provides insight into how ideas about management have changed. The model successfully portrays how the authority of the manager has moved to a more subordinate-centered authority,  delineating how those who hold the knowledge make the actual decisions. This shift can be seen as the first step toward an end to hierarchy. Also, the natural progression of management theory was and is toward more personal leadership, where more employees have a greater impact on organizational decisions and outcomes.

        "description":"This paper examines existing and model curriculums from all disciplines offering public relations courses in terms of the philosophical and theoretical developments relevant to public relations. First, the paper outlines the model curriculum derived from the 1987 study cosponsored by the Public Relations Society of America and the Association of Educators in Journalism and Mass Communication. Second, the paper analyzes, in terms of the &quot;ideal&quot; curriculum model, a review of 3,201 U.S. university and college catalogues, identifying 578 undergraduate departments offering public relations courses. Third, the paper focuses on P. Hamilton's survey of theory and curriculum, especially on journalism/mass communication and communication/speech communication respondents' views of theories  in terms of awareness, validity, and usefulness. Lastly, the paper examines the M. Fitch-Hauser survey of public relations programs for program characteristics and confirms the large number of public relations programs in speech communication departments. The paper integrates the results into a new curriculum proposal, one that best fits a multicultural, multifunctional, and integrating model of public relations. In conclusion, the paper suggests a movement away from publics to a more cohesive approach toward the public relations professional creating a sense of community. Fifteen references are attached.

One episode of each of the six 30-minute shows was selected for analysis, in each case an episode that centered around a group of characters and their interaction. Sequentially fragmented, edited versions that contained only the scenes where group interaction occurred were diagrammed and accompanied by a synopsis of the scene, an identification of the group unit, and an identification of the apparent group purpose. Several general themes came through in the episodes examined: (1) even though the shows use a group  context for interaction, group interaction generally means personal problem solving; (2) while there are differences in the dominance of the members, the differences in friendly and unfriendly behaviors are the ones that give the groups their flavor; (3) non-central characters in the story lines are the ones most often in the swing area between the dominant subgroups of the story; and (4) work is romanticized. Future research on group communication might work toward new definitions of the nature of group goals and group tasks; more detail about group interaction is needed.

Subjects, 200 adults approached at public locations, were asked to: (1) read one of three narrative descriptions of a fictitious organization (which included a review of eight unethical acts by an assistant manager); (2) respond to 11 dependent measures; (3) provide an overall evaluation of the company and of the assistant manager; and (4) compare their likely behavior with the assistant manager's behavior, given an employer like the one described in the narrative. The narratives described conditions in which: (1) the  company was highly supportive of its employees, and external/internal messages were congruent; (2) more average in its support of its employees, and internal/external messages were somewhat incongruent; or (3) not supportive of its employees and internal/external messages were clearly incongruent. Results indicated that the congruency or incongruency between external and internal message systems may significantly impact employee perceptions of the organization's cultural image, which in turn may foster or inhibit unethical employee acts against the employer.

The total approach is defined as the most comprehensive program that can be designed, managed, and supported by a particular college or university. It includes involving participating students in forensic experiences that are planned, developed, and evaluated by internal and external standards. Students are afforded numerous opportunities to develop multifaceted skills in research, organization, and presentation as they work toward achieving individual and team goals. For example, at  Southwest Baptist University (Missouri) students are challenged to prepare for events they have not previously tried, and other approaches are emphasized at other schools. The total forensic program also involves students in a variety of audience settings, provides evaluative feedback for students, and remains sensitive to the problem of access in admission, theory, and practice.

As a case in point, a comparison of the current events descriptions of the Twin Cities Forensic League with those of the NIET and the NFA tournaments reveals a substantial similarity among the three. Moreover, there is a more widespread understanding of the differences which do exist in events descriptions and, in some cases, the principles which those differences represent.  Although non-uniform events descriptions and events continue to exist, for a variety of specific reasons and benefits, the greater uniformity of events benefits students who are preparing for a variety of tournaments. However, no set of rules, no matter how uniform, will ever resolve the really central questions of whether a speech must be problem/solution to be persuasive, or what constitutes a serious point, or what the difference is between acting and interpretation.

Data were elicited through open-ended interviews with 16 members of a Catholic student center at a state university in the Midwest. Interviews were also conducted with the director, assistant director, and secretary to obtain background information about the center and its purpose. Results revealed two layers of relationships within the organization: a member identity cluster and a member authority cluster. The first consisted of the social/emotional relationships that made up the community and allowed it to achieve its goal of emotional and spiritual development of community members. These relationships revolved  around individual member identity which was influenced by a number of factors, and, in turn, influenced a number of others. The second concerned the task structure and functioning of the organization. The key appeared to be the use of member authority in the delegation of tasks and establishment of task role expectations. Task role expectations differed a great deal among members, which led to differing emphases on effective completion of tasks. Findings suggest practical applications for college student personnel concerned with new student retention and for individuals involved in campus ministry. Additional research into student dissatisfaction appears to be called for. (Two figures depicting the Member Identity and Member Authority clusters are included.) (KEH)",

        "description":"This study examined a smoking intervention program, which employed group competitions with rewards, to determine its effects on adolescents' smoking-relevant beliefs, their subjective norms, and peer influence. Initially, 1,187 seventh graders in Burlington, Clinton, and Muscatine, Iowa were surveyed in 1984. Data were gathered from a re-survey administered to 964 of these seventh graders attending seven middle schools in 1986. Two communities participated in a smoking prevention curriculum as well as in a knowledge competition and a nonsmoking competition while students in the third community received only the educational unit. Results revealed that the effects of the intervention on self-reported smoking interacted with the amount adolescents had smoked prior to the  intervention. Those who had never smoked and occasional smokers who participated in the competition reported smoking less frequently than those in the control group. The opposite was found for adolescents who were already weekly smokers before the intervention; weekly smokers who were in the competition increased their frequency of smoking more than those who were not and had higher salivary thiocyanate levels. When self-described smoking was the dependent variable, this boomerang effect was found for girls but not for boys. Results also indicated that the competition affected subjects' beliefs about the bad effects and short-term good effects of smoking, as well as their perceptions of their friends' attitudes toward smoking, and these, in turn, affected smoking behavior.

First, it allows a student to both make and develop professional contacts. Second, both full and part-time employment offers become available. Third, students can develop greater understanding of their own strengths and weaknesses. Fourth, students can refine their career goals. Internship programs also hold benefits for the field supervisors and sponsoring organizations, such as providing motivated workers at no or relatively low cost to an organization and furnishing the opportunity to train possible future employees for the organization. Participation in internship programs allows the field supervisor and organization to maintain a working relationship with the university in  which the students are enrolled. In several cases, special projects can be accomplished more inexpensively by using student expertise. Departments and universities benefit by providing a different mode of career education to their students and attracting attention to and the enrollment of majors in the department. Administration of the internship also keeps faculty in touch with the needs of the working world. At one large Southern university, student eligibility for internships is determined by the major and minor of the student, grade point average, and participation in the pre-major requirements. Interested students follow specific procedures to enter the program and to meet the internship requirements. Students are enrolled on a pass/fail basis. The grade is determined by the use of a  journal kept by the student, a final paper analyzing communication in the organization, and a written evaluation by the field supervisor. (MG)",

        "description":"A study examined whether a perceiver would distinguish between nonverbal messages sent with greater or lesser intent and the extent to which this correlated with the messages' general affect. Sixty-two students were recruited from communication courses at a large southwestern university to participate in a &quot;conversation study.&quot; None had taken a course in nonverbal communication. Each student participated in a two-person interview in which a confederate, whom students thought was merely another participant, was instructed to manipulate both the intent and the valence of his or her nonverbal messages. Results indicated that participants saw most negative messages as intentionally sent while positive messages were seen as more unintentional. Positive behaviors were also viewed as  directed toward the perceiver and resulted in more socially favorable evaluations of the message sender. Likewise, intent did not affect the readability of nonverbal messages, and perceivers were able to distinguish equally between positive and negative messages that were encoded with greater or lesser intent. Individuals sending positive messages, however, were interpreted as being more competent and evaluated more favorably than those sending negative messages. Intent had no significant impact on social perceptions. (Forty references are attached.) (Author/KEH)",

Data were elicited through both a survey instrument and in-depth interviews with 26 current employees and 12 former employees of a national organization in the business of managing large tracts of land along with associated resources, which two years earlier had created a new division. (The organization in question employs thousands of people and has a sizable annual operating budget.) The dominant culture of the parent organization stressed a family style culture while, in contrast, the &quot;immigrant&quot; managers prided themselves on hiring the most qualified  candidates and not being part of the network which had historically controlled destiny for the parent organization. Results revealed significant differences between management and professional perceptions with regard to teamwork, local and national management, consistency with mission, and productivity. Findings illustrate a profile of a division which was demoralized and alienated from all but one manager. Findings also suggest practical steps consultants may take to ensure more successful reorganization or mergers. (Two figures of data are included; 25 references are attached.) (KEH)",

        "author":["Benson, Thomas W."],
        "description":"Traditional conceptions of academic freedom in higher education are based on the 1940 statement of the American Association of University Professors. Sanctions were most typically administered hierarchically: administrators, perhaps pressured by forces outside the institution, punished offending faculty by denying or revoking tenure. Based on the experiences of one editor, classic assaults on academic freedom have not been a problem. In the culture of scholarly publication, the gatekeeping process results in the rejection of 80% to 90% of manuscripts submitted. The issue of merit, even with a process of blind reviewing, can and does result in decisions in which political judgments are invoked: (1) In speech communication, although a variety of politically correct sentiments may  be expressed, there is a tendency to actively discourage the statement of political views. (2) In a field full of diverse and developing research and epistemological paradigms, manuscripts may be rejected for what their authors might regard as having to do with the politics of inquiry. It is not clear whether these should be regarded as potential violations of academic freedom or as matters of legitimate professional practice about which differences must continue to exist. In general, it appears that limits upon academic freedom in speech communication are either self-imposed or are administered by colleagues and peers through the process of blind reviewing, rather than by being imposed from without by administrators or the external society.

These films are modern retellings of ancient myths. Carl Jung has described myths as &quot;fundamental expressions of human nature.&quot; In the films, fairy tale motifs such as typical clothing, helpful animals, knights, princess, emperor, Millenium Falcon, combined with primordial settings, are projected into the future with star ships, death stars and light swords. Although the films take the spectator far into the future, connections to an unconscious past are never forgotten. The popularity of these films could be attributed not only to the actors, special effects, and adventure but also to the connections with the collective and  personal unconscious which the trilogy continually provokes.

        "description":"In 1986, Columbia State Community College (CSCC) initiated the Center of Emphasis to develop interactive video and computer-assisted instruction programs for students. This charge included stimulating faculty interest in developing such programs and providing technical assistance in their production. Initially, center staff contacted faculty personally and used an interactive video tape on anatomy and physiology to make faculty aware of the technology. In addition, various incentives have been offered to faculty to encourage them to develop interactive video programs, including the assistance of center staff in the performance of the most time-consuming aspects of development, as well as the option to develop media programs to satisfy instructional improvement requirements. The  center also provides faculty with the technical knowledge, guidance and assistance needed in the various stages of production. During the pre-production stage, center staff work with the faculty to create the video's objective, develop a script and storyboard, and record the audio portion of the video, which includes the interactive questions and the narration. When pre-production is completed, production of the storyboard begins, including the orchestration and filming of all live segments, still shots, modeling, and demonstrations. Finally, the post-production stage begins, as the video segments are edited and synchronized with the audio portion to ensure that there are smooth transitions between each visual image and the recorded script. After test runs, the interactive video is placed  in the center laboratory for use and evaluation by student learners. From the conception of a topic to the delivery of a program to students, teamwork between the Center of Emphasis staff and the faculty is necessary to create a quality presentation. (VVC)",

        "description":"This paper outlines seven challenges facing the United States in the preparation of a competent workforce for the year 2000. The first challenge will be to predict what specific workers will need to know in the year 2000, and to make this prediction 4 to 6 years prior to students' completion of the training process. The second challenge is to define and develop training programs that recognize the individual needs of those who will make up the new work force, which will include more than 50% women, 15-18% racial minorities, as many as 20-25% foreign laborers, and an increase in handicapped people. This challenge entails the recognition that training programs need to develop a curriculum that both meets the specific technological requirements of a job and gives workers the  adaptability necessary to accommodate rapid changes. The third challenge is to help business and industry understand the need to accommodate the new work force and to identify viable options for accomplishing that, such as the redefinition of the work day or the work site. The fourth challenge is for educators and employers to make adjustments and compromises to accommodate the cultural and value differences among the diverse individuals who will make up the work force of the future, while the fifth challenge is to ensure that the value of quality is instilled in each member of the work force. The sixth challenge is to educate and train people both to use current technology and to be motivated to keep up with emerging technologies. The final challenge will be to raise the awareness of  society, its political representatives, and the business community regarding these multiple work force challenges. (JMC)",

Part I provides a description of the methodological and procedural considerations which have guided efforts to understand institutional effectiveness. First, a description is provided of the conceptual foundation for assessment, which emphasizes examining educational effectiveness from both the student and college perspectives, understanding students' educational goals, and determining cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes for students. Next, eight positive effects of institutional research efforts are described, including the development and implementation of a set of all-college performance indicators, the design of new and continuing student goal  statements, and the redesign of the program and discipline audit process. Part I concludes with challenges and future directions of CCP's assessment efforts. Part II highlights some of the major institutional strengths and concerns identified in the first 3 years of assessment, including: (1) students reported greatest progress in developing communication skills and self-confidence; (2) CCP students entered the job market with relative ease and at salaries reflective of the economic value added by the college; (3) completion of a degree did not always mean improved performance at a transfer institution, and transfer performance varied across programs; and (4) all students reported dissatisfaction with the opportunities for integration into the campus life. Finally, part III provides a  framework for future efforts in examining student academic progress at CCP, focusing on Tinto's model of student attrition. This model maintains that students who are more involved in a college's academic and social life are more likely to persist and to have higher levels of personal/academic growth than less involved students. The report concludes with an application of Tinto's theoretical framework to CCP students and a future research agenda. A 17-item bibliography is included. (Author/JMC)",

First, an overview of the literature on student attrition is presented, followed by a specific review of research based on Tinto's model of student attrition. This model maintains that the two primary factors related to student withdrawal are the personal characteristics of the student and the nature of the student's interaction with the college. The review indicates, however, that inconsistencies exist in the correlation of these two factors to student persistence. Next, Tinto's model is applied to recent research findings at CCP to determine its appropriateness as a guide for developing strategies to increase  student retention. Specifically, general retention patterns at the college are compared to student characteristics, revealing the following: (1) in general, 6% of the White students were likely to graduate in two years, compared to 2.2% of the Black students, 1.5% of the Asian students, and 1.4% of the Hispanic students; (2) while students receiving financial aid were more likely to graduate than students receiving no aid, they were also more likely to be dismissed for academic reasons; (3) a close correlation was found between low admissions test scores and student withdrawal; (4) students who attended private high schools generally had higher grade point averages and lower attrition rates than public school graduates; and (5) students who entered CCP at a remedial level and enrolled in  remedial programs persevered as well as college-level entrants. Finally, the paper concludes that a correlation does exist between student characteristics, college experience, and persistence in CCP research findings, making Tinto's model an appropriate guideline for institutional assessment efforts.

Introductory remarks in Part 1 highlight the benefits of the college's programs for faculty, Writing Fellows, the college administration, and students. Part 2 provides background on the Writing Center and the frequency of its use, indicating that more than half of the increased usage of MCCC's Learning Assistance Center could be attributed to the newly instituted Writing Center. Part 3 contains an evaluation of the Writing Fellows program based on survey responses from students who had worked with the tutors. Highlighted findings indicate that 76% of the students felt that  the Writing Fellows' comments on their rough drafts and conferences with the Writing Fellows were helpful or very helpful. Positive and negative responses to open-ended questions are included. Part 4 summarizes the survey responses of 14 of the 15 faculty members who used the services of the Writing Fellows in winter 1989. All but one of the instructors indicated that they would be willing to work with Writing Fellows again, and 11 felt that the papers they received that term were better than papers submitted by classes without tutors. Part 5 contains the evaluations of the program by the 25 Writing Fellows. Survey findings revealed that the Writing Fellows read and commented upon the first drafts of 49 papers, they spent 2 hours a week in the Writing Center, they each worked with between  10 and 15 students, and they all felt that their own writing had improved as a result of their work. A chronology of the WAC program from winter 1986 to June 1989 is attached. (JMC)",

Part I argues that significant interventions are needed to increase minority enrollment in postsecondary education in order to avert serious social and economic consequences. This section cites demographic, educational, and labor market trends that support this contention and presents the Missouri State Higher Education Executive Officers' recommendations regarding necessary interventions. Part II offers birth rate and college-age population projections by racial/ethnic group for the years 1990 to 2050, emphasizing the rapid growth of the minority population in the United States, especially within the traditional college-age group. Part  III examines national and statewide enrollment and retention trends among minorities, stressing that past gains in minority participation in higher education, both as students and faculty, have eroded at a precipitous rate. Drawing from a review of the literature, part IV highlights state policies and exemplary institutional programs and strategies for recruiting minorities and improving their retention in higher education. Finally, part V identifies the types of databases that will be needed by educators to develop intervention strategies for improving minority participation; highlights five areas in which comprehensive needs assessments should be conducted; and suggests the development of several types of programs focusing on outreach, articulation, testing, remediation, work-study,  financial aid, and faculty recruitment. The appended paper, &quot;Trends and Issues of Minority Participation in American Higher Education,&quot; examines high school graduation and college participation rates, the transition from high school to college, minority enrollment in undergraduate and postgraduate education, community college transfers, recruitment and retention in four-year institutions, minority faculty role models, campus climate, institutional support services, and faculty recruitment and retention trends.

        "description":"A study was conducted to examine the delivery of off-campus and out-of-district instruction in Missouri during fiscal year (FY) 1988. For the purposes of the study, &quot;off-campus&quot; referred to those courses offered by a four-year college at a location other than its principal campus, and &quot;out-of-district&quot; referred to courses offered by public two-year colleges beyond their district boundaries. Although the state has a policy framework that conceptually addresses questions of need, resource utilization, institutional mission, and quality programming, there are few constraints on out-of-district and off-campus programming beyond those imposed by the colleges themselves. Study findings, based on the FY 1988 annual out-of-district course survey of two-year colleges, as well as a special  survey of four-year institutions, included the following: (1) between 1979 and 1988, course offerings increased 746.8% and enrollment increased 517.4%; (2) nearly 40% of the 440 sites where courses were offered had no laboratories, libraries, advising/counseling services, or other instructional support resources; (3) public four-year institutions used regular faculty for 51.9% of their courses, while public two-year colleges and independent institutions used regular faculty for only 8.6% of their classes; (4) at least some off-campus or out-of-district courses were offered for college credit in 82 of Missouri's 114 counties; (5) while two-year colleges tended to operate within their district or in areas adjacent to it, four-year public and independent colleges operated at a combined total  of 122 sites located at least 100 miles from the main campus; and (6) for most of the public institutions, out-of-district and off-campus instruction provided a surplus of funds, although most institutions also had individual sites reporting deficits. Based on study findings, it was concluded that most Missouri citizens had reasonable access to postsecondary education, that issues of efficiency were not necessarily adequately considered in off-campus programming, and that research on quality control was needed. Recommendations, survey instruments and data are included. (JMC)",

In addition, the report analyzes the challenges and opportunities for higher education arising from a developing technological base accompanied by an increasing demand for a better educated and more highly skilled workforce. Section I discusses the impact of technological change and international competition on the labor force, the global economy, organizational structures, and the worksite. The discussion indicates that technological changes in the work place can either increase or downgrade the skill levels required of workers, depending upon the occupation. As a result, a  dichotomy is emerging between a growing number of new jobs requiring increasing levels of education and skills, and a large group of low-paying jobs requiring minimal skills. Section II reviews national and, when available, statewide demographic and literacy trends and patterns as they relate to the workforce. The section describes a slow growing and aging workforce; the entry of an increasing number of women, minorities, and immigrants into the labor force; and the adverse influence of illiteracy on the labor market and economy. Highlighted problems include a workforce that is shrinking and less willing to change, a shortage of teachers, increasing needs for day care, and the need to ensure basic literacy among all Americans and immigrants. Section III addresses the changes which must be  made at state and institutional levels so that higher education in Missouri can meet job retraining and skill upgrading requirements. The report includes appendixes which list industrial and occupational classifications, an analysis of manpower demand by type of industry, employment trends by occupation and their relationship to educational levels, and 32 references.

        "description":"Designed to provide information to administrators at Housatonic Community College, Connecticut (HCC) on the status of writing-across-the-curriculum (WAC) programs, this report presents an overview of WAC, strategies for its implementation, and examples of WAC programs currently in existence. Introductory sections present a brief history of and a rationale for WAC, indicating that it emphasizes the process of writing as a valuable tool for learning in any discipline, and that it stresses the organizational skills and course content learned through the writing process over grammar and syntax. Next, general suggestions are put forth for teaching WAC courses, such as using traditional formal papers, essay exams, written homework, and journals or class commentaries, as well as the  need for instructors to make their assignments as specific as possible and tie them closely to course objectives. Specific techniques are presented for science, math, business, social science, and non-English humanities courses. Then, 12 examples from an informal study of WAC programs at 80 colleges and universities are described, indicating that all the programs have initiated courses across a broad spectrum of disciplines and all have proved beneficial to both students and faculty. After listing 10 steps for evaluating WAC programs, the paper discusses methods to implement a program, including the use of faculty workshops, writing consultants, a college-wide writing committee, or writing labs for all students. Finally, recommendations are provided for the success of the WAC program at  HCC, including the use of the Center for Educational Services as a core for the program, the establishment of a college-wide writing committee if necessary, and the appointment of a director to coordinate the program. Appendixes (the bulk of the document) include sample writing assignments, course syllabi, and a 176-item bibliography. (VVC)",

        "description":"This report describes the work of a college-wide committee on enrollment management appointed in the spring of 1988 at Arapahoe Community College (ACC), in Colorado, to investigate causes of student attrition. Chapter 1 lists the main points considered by the committee in their research, including a definition of student persistence, the requirements of a data collection system, student and college characteristics that affect retention, characteristics of successful and unsuccessful retention projects, and possible courses of action. This chapter also briefly reviews several articles used by the committee in developing its approach. Chapter 2 provides data on ACC's early alert system, in which instructors identify high risk students early in the term and contact these students by  letter or phone, while chapter 3 identifies the characteristics of these high risk students, including whether they are of monority status, in the 24 or under age group, and enrolled full-time. Chapter 4 describes a follow-up study of no-shows to identify potential problem areas in the application/admissions process; while chapter 5 presents reasons that fall 1988 students gave for withdrawing, including conflicts with work, family illness, or transportation problems. Chapter 6 contains data from a survey of electronics students, including reasons for enrolling, grades received, and factors which contributed to withdrawal or failure. Chapter 7 describes a pilot survey designed to determine why students who attended in fall 1987 did not return in spring 1988; and chapter 8 provides data on  retention for the 1987-88 and 1988-89 school years, indicating percentages of returning students by gender, educational goal, ethnicity, employment status, enrollment status, and major. Finally, chapter 9 lists the enrollment management committee's seven recommendations to improve student retention during 1989-90. (JMC)",

        "description":"The proportion of community college students transferring to a four-year institution dropped considerably during the 1970's and early 1980's, a situation leading to accusations that the colleges do not prepare their students sufficiently well for transfer. However, several other factors have an influence on transfer rates. The fact that most community college students attend on a part-time basis accounts for some of the difference in rates of bachelor's degree attainment between community college and four-year college matriculants. The mere fact that community college students must transfer from one institution to another may also account for some of the shortfall. The transfer function is further weakened by institutional policies that support the idea of the college as a  passive resource available to all who would drop in at any time during their lifetimes. These policies result in 85% of the matriculants not obtaining a degree, a lateral curriculum in which prerequisites to courses are not enforced, and a system in which student progress towards completion is not monitored. In efforts to increase transfer rates, colleges have begun to monitor student progress, provide information and hold meetings on transfer opportunities, enforce course prerequisites, and offer remedial courses to bring a sizable population up to a basic standard of literacy. Statewide efforts can be seen in California, which set aside $3 million for transfer centers in 20 colleges; New Jersey, which awarded special funds to its colleges to recruit transfer oriented minority students;  and Colorado and Michigan, which mandated articulation plans between community colleges and public universities. While these efforts will eventually have some effect, major changes in philosophy and policy must be made if the number of students who transfer to a four-year university is to increase substantially. Statewide policies should be established to: (1) guarantee transfer students acceptance at a university without loss of units; (2) set aside special funds to reward colleges for improved transfer rates; (3) establish a common course numbering system for two- and four-year colleges; and (4) develop a centralized, accessible interinstitutional database. More importantly, community college staff members should identify potential transfers early on and monitor their progress until  they complete their studies and enter the university. (VVC)",

        "description":"Student tracking systems are enabling increasing numbers of community colleges to respond to external demands for accountability with tangible measurements of student progress and institutional outcomes. Several recent trends in marketing, accountability, communications with students, and internal competition for resources have prompted interest in monitoring student progress. Six stages in the student flow process should be monitored: awareness of the college, first inquiry about the school, formal entry, the college experience, completion, and followup. Tracking systems can be developed for any one of these stages, but a number of decisions must first be made in order to collect, store, and disseminate the information that the college and its staff need. In addition to  decisions about the purposes and organization of the tracking system, the designers must identify from the data elements routinely collected on each student those that are relevant to student persistence and outcomes. The American Association of Community and Junior Colleges has developed a student tracking model that identifies variables related to student characteristics, progress, and followup. While tracking systems offer many benefits, the potential for problems exists with respect to data collection, the institution's research capacity, follow-up information, and effective use of the information. Regardless of these difficulties, tracking is destined to become an integral part of community college management. (JMC)",

Large numbers of fourth and fifth graders and college students wrote brief essays in which they named individuals they admired and gave their reasons for naming the individuals. The following year, children in grades 2-6 in several schools wrote about the person or persons they most admired and the reasons for their admiration. Many children wrote about admiration of an entertainer or sports figure. Their justification for the nomination often focused on the skill and competence of the individual. For example, many girls admired Debby Gibson because she writes her own songs and has achieved success in her teens. More commonly, children admired one or both parents or a relative or  teacher. The admiration of parents and other relatives and friends persisted in college students, and their justification shifted from what the parent did for the child to the admirable qualities of the parent.

        "description":"Because schemas are often defined imprecisely and intuitively, the term &quot;schema&quot; is often misapplied in research. Consequently, researchers may fail to understand the complete scope of the phenomenon they are studying. Discussions of children's gender schema development and the influence of the gender schema on children's social information processing are adversely affected by such ambiguity. Gender schema approaches contain two primary, interrelated views of schema: (1) a knowledge-based approach predominantly concerned with developmental changes in children's amount and type of gender-based knowledge; and (2) a process-based approach mostly concerned with how, when, and why children's gender-based knowledge and attitudes influence their encoding, retrieval, and storage of  gender-relevant information. Research has shown that although children's amount of gender-based knowledge consistently increases through early childhood, older children demonstrate substantial individual differences in their use of the gender dimension to classify and organize social information. It is unclear how the knowledge and application of gender schema are related. But research strongly suggests that gender schema and gender-role development do not constitute a unitary construct.

        "description":"While research has outlined the nature of children's friendships as socialization contexts, the outline is drawn mostly in modal terms. Situational or contextual variations also need attention. This paper reports findings of studies of conflicts and the implications of conflict for friendship relations. The studies vary widely in the situations in which conflict was observed and in other ways, such as the children's ages and the measurement strategies used. Two hypotheses emerging from the results concern the significance of children's friendships as socialization contexts. The hypotheses emerged from the contrasting of conflict management between friends and nonfriends of various ages in various situations. When the social situation is open, friends seek to minimize or soften  conflicts with each other in the rate with which they occur, their affective intensity, and the equitability of the outcome. When the situation is closed, and resolution alternatives are not numerous, friends are freer to disagree. Children's friendships thus support disagreements and oppositions, but this support varies according to the situation. It is concluded that contextual constraints support the continuation of children's relationships with each other. (RH)",

A total of 29 mother-adolescent-sibling triads from father-absent families participated in the study. In 13 of the families, the adolescent had a history of delinquent behavior. Assessment was conducted in the family home by trained interviewers. Mothers rated both children on the Revised Behavior Problem Checklist and on a modified version of the Intensity of Parental Punishment Scale. Each mother indicated  how she would respond to the first, second, and third occurrences of each of 33 misbehaviors. Results showed that mothers in both high- and low-risk families responded to noncompliance at hypothetically different times with increasingly intense discipline. Moreover, this pattern was evident in each of the discipline situations: misbehavior in school, crying, cruelty to children and animals, and misbehavior in public. Mothers in low-risk families chose higher intensities of discipline for the younger siblings in school-related situations than did mothers in high-risk families. (RH)",

Synoptic tables are provided so that the reader can quickly ascertain the purpose, methodology, and findings of each summarized study. Specifically, after the definition of terms and the historical material, sections review surveys made in 1925, 1961, 1967, and 1985, summarize recent reviews of the literature, and compare full-day versus half-day schedules and  alternate day versus half-day schedules. The comparisons are designed to provide educational decision makers with the most up-to-date information and research findings available on the relative advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches to scheduling. Based on the findings, conclusions point out merits of the alternative schedules. A total of 20 books and 17 articles are cited, in addition to 50 citations of studies for review. (RH)",

        "description":"A fourth-grade teacher, who was employed to provide a special enrichment program to minority children with above-average academic abilities, designed a practicum to increase parent involvement in her classroom. A parent volunteer questionnaire and an activities survey form were developed to determine the level and nature of parent interest. A parent translator provided information about school events to non-English-speaking parents, and encouraged parents to speak in the classroom. Special incentives were used to increase parent participation. Seminars were planned to update program information, and workshops were conducted to advise and guide parents. In addition, parent-teacher conferences were conducted to inform parents and enlist cooperation. Results suggested that the level  of parent involvement was increased by: (1) persuading parents to attempt an activity; (2) finding the right activity for parents; (3) using parents in such roles as translator and caller; (4) providing classroom incentives for children who helped to enlist parent volunteers; (5) involving all children in activities; (6) using community resources; (7) holding positive parent-teacher conferences; (8) maintaining nonbiased opinions about parents; and (9) making sure that parents felt needed. Program evaluation data indicated that the intervention had positive results. (RH)",

        "description":"This article reports on the development, internal consistency, and reliability of a new preschool and kindergarten classroom observational measure based on NAEYC's Guidelines for Developmentally Appropriate Practices. The Classroom Practices Inventory (CPI) is a 26-item rating scale tapping the curricular emphasis and emotional climate of programs for 4- and 5-year-old children. The scale demonstrates a high degree of internal consistency. Over half the measure's variance is accounted for by a factor tapping encouragement of curiosity, creativity, and provision of concrete materials. In a study of 10 preschool programs, CPI scores correlated significantly with teachers' and parents' educational attitudes. Modest relationships were found between the CPI scores of children's  preschools and measures of academic skills, creativity, and anxiety. It is concluded that the CPI appears to be a promising measure for examining developmentally appropriate practices in early childhood education, especially programs providing formal academic learning experiences. The wide range of scores and their association with other school, parent, and child variables indicate that the CPI is sensitive to important differences in curriculum and teaching practices in early childhood programs.

Changes identified concern increases in the number and percentage of children who live in poverty, maternal employment in two-parent families, single-parent families, and the number of children in nonparental child care. Characteristics of poverty for children involve duration, race, one-parent families, and rural populations. Low income is associated with many negative outcomes for children, and income loss is an important contributor to problems experienced by mother-only families. The effects of these family variables are mediated and moderated by a range of child, family and environmental characteristics. Boys appear to be more vulnerable than girls to stressful events in the  family. The age of the child is an important determinant of effects. Support systems in the extended family and community consistently emerge as important moderators of the negative effects of divorce, maternal employment, and nonparental care.

Sections of the paper focus on seven questions: (1) Is music really universal? (2) When should musical training begin? (3) When should music education begin? (4) What is meant by a 'developmental' music program? (5) Is music relevant to other areas of early learning? (6) What about reading music? and (7) What is the role of the instrumental teacher? It is concluded that each child has a natural right to the best musical education his or her society can provide, and it is hoped that society in the the 21st century will fully recognize that right. The bibliography of  19 citations on music in relation to education and development is supplemented by a list of other useful materials, such as songbooks, and a list of titles in the Learning with Mother and Early Learning series.

Two problems were addressed: (1) the lack of knowledge about the dynamics of curriculum implementation in settings where early childhood curriculum practices were regarded as innovative by a significant proportion of participants; and (2) the need to assist other teachers in their attempts to learn about curriculum implementation. Two research questions provided general guidance for the study. First, what did innovative teachers consider to be important actions and events affecting their work during the early stages of change toward a flexible, developmentally  responsive curriculum? Second, how could information gained from these teachers be used to assist other early childhood teachers and student teachers interested in curriculum implementation? Phase 1 of the study involved the gathering of data from a group of teachers in state primary schools in Queensland who used multi-age grouping as a starting point in initiating educational innovation. Phase 2 concerned dissemination of findings and processes in inservice and preservice courses. Findings are discussed. (RH)",

        "description":"The efforts of Queensland's parents, government officials, and early childhood professionals to raise the quality of child care by developing a voluntary process for accreditation of early childhood programs are described. The envisioned accreditation process would begin with collaborative self-study by child caregivers of the extent to which their programs realized 10 program components. Each component would be defined by a goal, a brief rationale, and several criteria. Components defined were: (1) interactions among staff and children; (2) curriculum/program for children; (3) interactions between staff and parents; (4) staff qualifications and development; (5) staffing patterns; (6) physical environment and setting; (7) health and safety factors; (8) food and nutrition issues;  (9) management and administration; and (10) evaluation. The self-study was to be followed by validation and consideration for accreditation. It is argued that many community benefits accrue from a voluntary program accreditation system built on clear regulations. The self-study facilitates staff development, parent education, and accountability to the community, and raises awareness of young children's needs for appropriate programs.

It was intended that the report be accessible to anyone involved in center-based work with preschool children and their families. It was assumed that an explanation of evaluation procedures used might be helpful to external evaluators or project team members uncertain about the nature of an external evaluator's role. Part I describes the background to the evaluation. The first chapter in Part I provides a brief introduction to some alternative models and styles of evaluation drawn from the theoretical literature. The second chapter outlines the context of the evaluation: the general idea of the community school, the nature of  the Craigroyston Curriculum Project, and the rationale and strategies involved in the Under-Fives study. Part II presents the evaluation report itself, which consists of sections on background, the program and participants, process and perceptions, analysis and evaluation of center characteristics, and conclusions and recommendations. A brief postscript raises central questions likely to be relevant to the evaluation of community-oriented projects in many different settings. (RH)",

Adults who contact these children are also especially susceptible to these diseases. Preventive measures include home care for non-toilet-trained children and scrupulous hand washing when infants are cared for in groups. Infant caregivers need information about precautions and appropriate procedures.

Children were given a random series of 8 decidable and 16 undecidable problems in which they had to determine in which of 2 houses a target character could be found. There were two characters of different sizes (a giant and a dwarf) and a series of four two-dimensional houses of decreasing size. Children of both ages were successful at dealing with the decidable problems. There were no age differences in performance. Children asked for extra information more often when problems were undecidable than when they were decidable. Examination of responses to undecidable problems suggested that the more similar the appearance of  the pair of houses, the easier it was to detect the problem as undecidable. Children as young as 5 years may be aware that while certain problems are undecidable and can be resolved with extra information, others remain unresolvable. Awareness of the necessity of logical reasoning appears to develop very early, and its origins may be found in the preschool years. (Author/RJC)",

A multitrait-multimethod analysis demonstrated that teachers accurately chose extremely popular children. Independent observer and peer nominations, but not student self-ratings, confirmed teacher accuracy. Popular children tended to be more adept in intellectual ability, social-emotional control, social skills, and physical competence. Six years later, the 10 extremely popular students and 9 randomly selected students still in the schools were  reexamined. When compared to their classmates in secondary school, the extremely popular children were still popular but did not maintain the extreme popularity they had in grade school. Some teacher ratings from grade school correlated with self-ratings. Peer nominations did not show the same strong patterns of relationships among the various personality characteristics found earlier. (Author/RJC)",

        "description":"Cooperation among students in classroom problem-solving activities is briefly discussed in terms of Piaget and cooperative problem-solving, guidelines for teachers, and the teacher's role. While research results are not unambiguous, teachers can encourage children to interact and share their perspectives during cooperative play by: (1) planning activities in which children have a shared goal; (2) ensuring that the goal is intrinsically interesting; (3) making it possible for children to achieve their goals through their own actions; and (4) seeing to it that the results of the child's actions are visible and immediate. To avoid giving directions, teachers can encourage children to interact with each other, help children clarify or adapt their shared goals, and involve children  who are unlikely to initiate interaction. It is concluded that cooperative problem-solving becomes a valuable part of the curriculum when teachers present problems that children at different developmental levels can work on together, encourage children's efforts to share perspectives, and help them achieve a common objective.

Focal questions were: (1) What perceptions did people hold concerning the meanings of curriculum in early childhood centers? (2) Within centers, who participated in the making of the decisions about curriculum? (3) What emphases were placed on parent participation, objectives, activities, evaluation of individual children, and support resources? (4) What curriculum policy documents, if any, from local, regional, and state levels influenced centers? Participating were 20 preschools/day care centers, which were spread across socioeconomic levels and geographically dispersed within two regions. Centers were administered by the Kindergarten Union,  the NSW Education Department, or the Department of Family and Community Services. Questionnaires and interviews with the directors of the centers revealed a need for the clarification of the precise meaning of 'curriculum' in all centers and a need for diversity in curriculum approaches. Directors and staff need substantial support in programming, materials development, and staff development activities. Patterns of differences between types of institutions did not emerge as significant except for differences in available planning time and staff autonomy. (RH)",

Subjects were 52 elementary school students in the second grade who scored in the fourth quartile on the Children's Group Embedded Figures Test. Observation and interview data were collected over a 4-month period. A field note journal was used to record events which occurred during the observation period. An interpretive journal was developed from concerns or interpretive comments made by investigators at weekly meetings. At the end of the observation period, formal interviews were conducted with students and teachers who had been selected for expertise in teaching the Logsdon curriculum, a  kinesiology-based approach to physical education. Teacher interviews focused on plans for the organization of the class, efforts to structure material for student learning, and perceptions of differences in student learning. Student interviews concerned the children's attitudes toward physical education and the relevance of the content to them. Data were analyzed using constant comparison. Results suggested that field-dependent students experienced difficulty focusing on lesson discussion, following directions, and working independently. Discussion concerns the role of structure and the influence of social relationships on learning behaviors of field-dependent children. (RH)",

Four groups of first grade students who had participated in Indiana's Project PRIME TIME (average class size of l8 or fewer) for 1 year were compared to one class of first grade students who had received first grade instruction in larger classes. Both groups were from the same Indiana school system. The following kinds of test scores were used as the basis for comparison: (1) achievement scores that all students had received on local competency tests in mathematics and reading; and (2) scores received on affective measures of self-concept and attitude toward school. These tests were administered to the students at the end of their respective first grade  years. The school year for the larger class group was 1983-84. The school years for the smaller PRIME TIME classes were 1984-85, 1985-86, 1986-87, and 1987-88. When the means of PRIME TIME group achievement and attitudes were compared to the means of the larger class group (non-PRIME TIME), the results showed that there were significant differences in all areas compared. All favored PRIME TIME. Furthermore, the means of PRIME TIME classes of recent school years were generally significantly higher than the means of PRIME TIME classes of earlier years. (RH)",

A mail survey gathered 3,232 completed questionnaires from a national random sample of 9,250 households. Statistical weighting made respondent categories representative of national proportions. Although respondents exhibited widespread agreement with the primacy of agriculture, farmers were most likely to agree and urban residents were least likely to agree that: (1) agriculture is the basic occupation of our society; (2) farming is a very satisfying occupation; (3) agricultural depression causes national depression; and (4) most food profits go to middlemen rather than farmers. Respondents were largely supportive of the concept of the family farm, but  urban residents were less likely to support the preservation of the family farm if that meant higher food prices than were suburban, rural nonfarm, and farm residents. Few respondents were satisfied with the record of government intervention in the farm sector. However, items pertaining to government involvement in agriculture elicited high rates of &quot;undecided&quot; responses, and showed little divergence among residential categories.

        "description":"This study used the Learning Style Inventory by Dunn, Dunn, and Price to identify learning style variables among school students in isolated Northeastern Manitoba communities. The importance of these learning styles to educational practice is discussed. The study sample consisted of Cree-speaking students enrolled in grades 4 through 10 at 3 randomly selected schools in Northeastern Manitoba. The Learning Style Inventory was administered to 422 students. The results indicated that 18 learning style variables were preferred by 25% or more of the students. There were no learning style variables which were preferred by all the students. Significant differences in learning style were found: among students in the three study sample schools; between males and female students; among  students at different grade levels; among excellent, average, and below-average students; and among students with high, medium, and low school attendance rates. The importance of the identified learning styles focuses on four areas. First, although learning style trends were identified, all students were not described by these trends. Attention should be given to individual and group learning styles. Second, the results of this study are not readily generalizable to all Cree-speaking students. Third, student achievement would probably be accelerated had attention been given to the learning style differences noted. Fourth, below-average students and students with low rates of attendance may have learning styles which are not fully considered. Attention to the learning styles of these  students may improve their achievement and attendance. (Author/TES)",

        "description":"Computer instruction can offer particular benefits to the Indian child. Computer use emphasizes the visual facets of learning, teaches language based skills needed for higher education and careers, and provides types of instruction proven effective with Indian children, such as private self-testing and cooperative learning. The Hupa, Yurok, Karuk, and Tolowa tribes have found a cooperative learning methodology effective in teaching reading and writing, and have developed a computer curriculum for cooperative learning. These tribes have installed their own phonetic alphabet, Unifon, on the Macintosh computer, and have produced bilingual instructional materials. In one project, part of a bilingual field experience for teacher credential candidates, students in grades 3 through 8  used the computer to produce bilingual natural history dictionaries in Hupa/English and Yurok/English. Working in teams of two or three, students wrote what they knew about particular plants and animals, translated their sentences into English, and designed page layouts. Older children served as role models for younger children, who could feel more comfortable about their contributions, knowing they were making guided choices. The teacher served as supervisor and resource. The Macintosh computer has the unique capacity of installing extra fonts, sets of characters. Any software program with a font menu can be used to write a bilingual text. This paper includes a list of Macintosh software programs, identifying skill areas and educational level for each. 14 references. (SV)",

        "author":["Greenwood, Judith"],
        "description":"This paper begins by examining the history of disability payments to disabled workers, specifically disability payments to coal workers. Efforts by the United Mine Workers of America made mine health and safety an issue in the 1960s, and continuing liberalization of the law continued through the 1970s. The identification of coal miners with disability is compounded by geographical and cultural barriers. Currently underscoring disability as a social construct among underground miners is the declining regional economy and rising unemployment, brought on by technological improvements in mining. The paper examines research about the effects of early health intervention among underground coal miners and describes other studies of physical disability in Appalachia. All cited research  supports the same general finding: disability is part of an Appalachian life pattern, a natural consequence of work occurring before old age. It is common for work to be punctuated with periods of temporary disability and to end in disability retirement. The uncertainty of mining as long-term employment makes benefits such as Social Security and Workers' Compensation a necessary station in the career course. There can be no solution to disability if disability itself is a solution to narrow socioeconomic choices. Only long-term improvements in basic education and the economy would reduce work disability patterns. (TES)",

The belief that all students can learn is an important characteristic of an effective school. Therefore, the goal of the North Park Project was a learning climate in which students would achieve, whatever their socioeconomic or ethnic background. Project objectives were: (1) providing a continuous in-service program to familiarize staff with concepts of effective schools/teachers and school management; (2) developing a school plan for parental involvement; (3) increasing learning opportunities for students by using models of direct instruction and time on task; (4)  developing an assessment program for basic skills, including rapid feedback systems to check achievement; (5) developing an academic improvement plan covering reading, oral and written communication, and mathematics; and (6) extending training services to staff at other schools. An outline provides practical details of activities undertaken to meet each of these objectives. The report describes previous conditions, remedial actions undertaken, and effects on the structured learning environment, academic feedback, school and teacher expectations, and time as a factor in learning. Appendices include an implementation schedule for other schools to follow, and forms and data related to discipline, attendance, parental involvement, and retentions. (Author/SV)",

The report also makes recommendations for improvements in programs designed to serve impoverished families. The introduction discusses the seeming paradoxes of poverty and generosity, powerlessness and strength, and futility and hope that exist within the families. Chapter 1 records the stories of single women raising children on low-wage jobs or federal benefits. At present, most families who are together fall between the cracks of Kentucky's human services programs. Chapter 2 includes stories that illustrate the current shortcomings in Kentucky's health programs. Chapter 3 discusses the issue of low-income housing.  Chapter 4 deals with public education and low-income families. While parents place a high value on education, too often their children are stigmatized by a system that helps label them as &quot;poor.&quot; Social and economic pressures push such students out of school. Chapter 5, &quot;Success Stories: The GED and Beyond,&quot; shows that even the most depressing stories can have a happy ending. Most of these stories are testaments to the benefits of additional education for the parents. The executive summary includes recommendations for policy changes, designed to counter problems related to poverty in Kentucky. (TES)",

In order to implement the model, existing services must be recognized and used. It is also important to gain visibility and acceptance, perhaps through speaking engagements before civic groups. Interested leaders should be identified and successful program achievements should be made known. Promotional ideas can also be borrowed from successful retail businesses or services. For effective rural  outreach, it is important to understand the differences and similarities between rural and urban communities, especially in regard to resource systems. Other considerations to be taken into account during implementation include socioeconomic factors and technological advances. Implementation strategies should fit the particular needs and characteristics of the community. The Agricultural Extension Model is one of the most successful models of disseminating services to rural areas. (TES)",

        "description":"This paper examines non-human loss and its psychological effect upon rural people. It discusses the absence of any ritual response to loss, including farm loss, that would otherwise benefit the loss victims or the surrounding society. The dilemma is comparable to that of the &quot;transitional person,&quot; the immigrant experience following World War II. The transitional person became stuck between cultures, exhibiting typically adolescent behaviors. The therapeutic response involves loosening the all-or-nothing thinking, opening up the client to new possibilities and role transition. Personal resources to mitigate loss, such as personality, sense of social role, or value structure, are examined. A study of farm adolescents' grief reactions to the sale and slaughter of animals is  described. The paper concludes that, in a large number of cases of emotional reaction to loss, &quot;recovery&quot; is not a possibility or goal. When the loss is significant to us, we return to it as a theme throughout our lives, gleaning significance and meaning from our attachments as we mature. The positive aspect of loss is this continuous process of integrating pieces into our role definition. (TES)",

        "description":"Many mathematics educators and researchers agree that current mathematics instruction in elementary and secondary schools focuses too much on efficient computation and not enough on mathematical understanding, problem solving, and reasoning. But beyond this agreement exist diverse views about what it means to know, understand, and learn mathematics. This paper considers various research perspectives that can inform thinking about what mathematics should be like in U.S. public elementary schools. To this end, the paper examines recent National Council of Teachers of Mathematics recommendations for changes in the mathematics curriculum and three major research perspectives that may inform thinking about what it means to know, understand, and learn mathematics. The first of these  perspectives is that of researchers, primarily cognitive psychologists, who focus on the individual knower of mathematics. The second perspective is that of the discipline of mathematics, what it means to understand mathematics from within the discipline. The third perspective is that of &quot;classroom practice,&quot; in particular the ways in which researchers studying the teaching and learning of mathematics in classrooms have conceptualized mathematical knowledge and learning. Goals for mathematics learning are discussed. A list of 108 references is included. (Author/YP)",

A pretest/posttest experimental group design was used. Forty-nine EEE mathematics seminar students (all were blacks except one) were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group. The seminar was continued for six weeks (18 sessions). The primary difference between the two groups was that the experimental group received 30  minutes of CAI in mathematics during each session. The results of statistical analysis showed that the CAI increased the students' mathematics scores and that they developed a more internal orientation through its use. (YP)",

Fourteen children in the 10- to 12-year-old age range were asked to represent and solve five complex arithmetic problems (three with temporal organization of data, two with spatial organization). The analysis of the representation process in relation to problem solving revealed that: (1) the older children had more ability to represent and to illustrate the relations between the data of the problem; and (2) discursive representation (reformulation of the problem by the child) seemed easier in the problems that called into play a temporal organization.

The purpose of the study described in this paper was to investigate the geometric understanding and misconceptions in students in the fourth through eighth grades who have been identified as gifted. The students were selected based on intelligence quotient or standardized test scores, teacher recommendations, and other instruments chosen by school districts. Group 1 received 20 hours of instruction in geometry using LOGO. Group 2 attended a 1-week summer camp having 7 hours of geometry instruction and activities. The change in the Van Hiele level between pretest and posttest was significant for both groups. Analysis of the protocols from  interviews indicates three categories of reasoning, the relationship between reasoning and knowledge of definitions, and reasoning involving parts of figures. Several implications for mathematics instruction are discussed. Seven references are listed. (YP)",

The course is designed to use scientific principles to study the processes of the environment; examine changes within the environment from a broad perspective; identify both natural and man-made activities that contribute to changes in the environment; and isolate the political, legal, economic, and social aspects. Nine basic process skills and five integrated processes are identified and described. Topic areas include: (1) &quot;Ecology&quot; (including general and human ecology); (2) &quot;Resources&quot; (containing units on soil, agriculture, water, land resources, forest, wildlife, air, and minerals); (3) &quot;Energy&quot;  (major and alternative sources); and (4) &quot;Pollution and Environmental Health&quot; (water/air/heavy metal pollution, solid and hazardous wastes, pesticides, radiation, chemical mutagens, food additives, noise, and epidemiological effects). The objectives, concepts, and activities for each subtopic area are listed in the curriculum standards. A skills checklist for 221 identified objectives is provided. A bibliography and reference materials are listed, and evaluation techniques are discussed. (YP)",

A total of 42 undergraduate students who completed a first semester physics course and received a grade of B or better participated in this study. The treatment involved five 1-hour sessions during which subjects solved a total of 25 classical mechanics problems using a hierarchical, computer-based, problem-analysis environment called the Hierarchical Analysis Tool (HAT). Two types of tasks were administered before and after treatment: (1) a problem-categorization task; and (2) a problem-solving task. The results indicate that the hierarchical approach to problem solving as exemplified by the HAT  helped students to shift their decision-making criteria for problem categorization from one based on surface features toward one based on deep structure. Two implications from this study were discussed. Twelve references are listed. (YP)",

        "description":"Misconceptions, shown to be prevalent in students even at the college level, may affect the cognitive process of making predictions in biology. The purpose of this study was to: (1) identify students' misconceptions about important biological concepts; (2) identify students' cognitive behaviors associated with making predictions about these concepts; and (3) examine the relationship between students' misconceptions and their cognitive behaviors of prediction. Information processing theory provided the theoretical framework for this research. Think-aloud interviews were employed in this study to collect videotape data on students' cognitive processes associated with their misconceptions and subsequent predictions about selected biological concepts. A computer simulation program,&quot;Pollute,&quot; allowed students to manipulate five independent variables affecting water quality. Three-stage instruction was given based on the learning cycle. This paper found that subjects who were successful were formal operational and exhibited fewer misconceptions than unsuccessful subjects. Misconceptions identified are listed. Recommendations are made for science teaching techniques that will help to identify and eliminate students' misconceptions. Forty-six references are listed. (Author/YP)",

        "description":"Over the last several years, educators have emphasized the need for students to become involved in service programs for others. An effective Catholic educational program must emphasize the message of the Gospel and encourage students to live in harmony and serve each other. Students who participate in service activities on a regular basis develop these qualities. The purpose of apostolic service programs is to help students acquire the Gospel values of justice to others, love of neighbor, and service to the world. Successful programs are developmentally appropriate, provide continual challenges, are part of real-life situations, and are sufficiently developed so that both students and teachers are fully prepared for the experience. Activities are described for primary,  intermediate, and upper elementary grades students. They include collections, service in the school, and service outside the school. Addresses from which to obtain further information are provided. Primary grade activities include collecting for World Hunger Day, cleaning the school yard, and adopt-a-family programs. Activities for intermediate grade students include a walk-a-thon for the homeless, a big brother/big sister program within the school to assist younger students, and a foster grandparent reading and visitation program. Upper grade activities include a Christmas basket collection, cross-age tutoring, and service to the community kitchen. (GEA)",

        "description":"There are many impediments to the development of political science as a true academic discipline in the Arab world. Each nation has its own ideological and political framework, and freedoms are determined within this framework. To operate outside this framework is considered an attack on the legality of the system and a possible threat to national security. Therefore, academic freedoms are limited and classroom instruction is a matter of delivering preplanned concepts. Objectionable professors and students are purged and information that is considered objectionable is not included when textbooks and journals are translated into Arabic. There is no separation of church and state in the Islamic world, so for a political scientist to discuss analytically the concepts of the  Caliphate or such topics as nationalism, socialism, or Marxism is tantamount to heresy. Because Ph.D. programs are not well developed, graduates of the universities must go abroad for further study. When they return to teach, they bring with them the teaching methods, textbooks, and philosophical and ideological orientations of those countries in which they studied. This diversity creates problems as professors and administrators disagree on curricula, subject content, examinations, treatment of students, and research methods. The Arabic language is required for instruction but there is a shortage of textbooks and reference materials in Arabic. The faculty in the Arab world sense these problems and are attempting to resolve them. (JB)",

Program 1, &quot;Scarcity,&quot; and Program 2, &quot;Opportunity Cost,&quot; were evaluated in a variety of classroom settings in the United States and Canada in February 1989. This report details the methodology and findings of this evaluation process. Both programs captured and maintained student attention. The character Econ was especially liked. Students performed satisfactorily on items assessing their comprehension of the major content points in Program 1. However, a need for an explanation of the term &quot;economic problems&quot; was uncovered; this will be included in the teacher's guide. Students did not perform satisfactorily  on two key content items related to the concept of &quot;opportunity cost&quot; in Program 2. The initial animated segment in this video has been revised to improve content understanding.

Individuals are not homogeneous and self-select into those alternatives where they have a comparative advantage. Examples where self-selection models have been applied include analyzing schooling, labor supply, and career choices. A student's predisposition toward economics can be measured based on the following factors: (1) prior exposure to economics; (2) motivation to study the subject; (3) existing level of economic sophistication; (4) grade level; and (5) poverty, gender, race, and region. Although motivation is the most significant variable, students who have previously taken an economics class are less likely to have a preference toward economics. Many of the socioeconomic and  personal attributes do not significantly influence the students' pre-existing preference for economics.

This collection of articles is intended to provide a forum for the discussion of theories and procedures of folklife study and to demonstrate both the variety of folklife communities and the unexpected similarities displayed by seemingly disparate groups or situations. &quot;Breakdancing&quot; (S.

It is necessary for problem solving, invention, and achievement. Every child has the ability to be a thinker. Thinking is an act and, as such, improves with practice. The curriculum and the teacher can help student thinking in several ways: (1) The teacher can set up projects that require thoughtful planning and execution. (2) Encouragement can be offered by the teacher when children try to exercise their mental powers. (3) Students can be given constructive feedback--the classroom should be an arena in which students are active and dialogue takes place. (4) Quantitative results can be downplayed without neglecting standards. (5) A key word should be  cooperation--students should see themselves, not others, as the primary competitor. A brief review of the literature is provided, followed by a discussion of the kind of classroom environment that promotes thinking. The document then describes the social studies curriculum grade by grade and discusses, using concrete examples, how critical thinking can be integrated into the learning process.

The respondents were almost unanimous in stating that such programs help people grow in faith into mature adult Christians; that they assist parents in their role as those primarily and principally responsible for the education of their children; and that they should help participants understand and articulate why they are Catholic. But only 75.9 percent of the bishops and 68.4 percent of the priests agreed that the main purpose of religious education is to communicate sound doctrine to children and youth. This attitude is also reflected by the importance given to  instruction in the doctrines of faith. There was strong agreement that programs must include elements of social justice, but not as many urged student participation in social service programs. Elementary programs were seen as clearly more effective than secondary programs. Parish renewal programs for adults were considered effective enough to warrant encouragement. A solid majority wanted parish religious education programs to begin at the preschool level. The bishops and priests were split almost evenly over whether each parish should have at least one children's liturgy of the word every Sunday. A copy of the questionnaire and 44 tables of survey data are included. (PPB)",

The purpose of initiating decision making opportunities is to promote creativity, not conformity. Five suggested steps for the process are: (1) explore the many alternatives available to resolve the issue/problem; (2) evaluate the plausibility of each solution; (3) make the decision/choice; (4) defend (justify) the decision/selection/resolution; (5) act and review. Students should practice the decision making process in the classroom to develop skills. Weighing the risks is also discussed. (PPB)",

        "description":"Social historians are taught that historical changes are caused by large social and economic forces, rather than great individuals; and so they study groups of people, broad economic movements, and underlying institutional structures that change slowly over time. But the general public demands information about the individual person told through historical narrative. Through this method, historians can still raise important and stimulating questions of broad significance. By studying Christopher Columbus as an individual, one can better understand how the United States evolved from the encounter between the Old World and the New and the great social and economic changes that this encounter began. Accurate translations of the documents that were written at the time of the  Columbian voyages have not been widely available heretofore, but are presented here in condensed form so that teachers can use the information when interpreting the past to students. If having access to these documents in reliable editions and translations changes the way Columbus is seen as a hero and makes possible new interpretations, then the historical consequences of his enterprise can become a new adventure of discovery. Columbus's youth and early career as a wool entrepreneur are discussed. He traveled in and beyond the Mediterranean and eventually he became an agent of the Spanish monarchy. A discussion of the &quot;Book of Privileges,&quot; a collection of royal documents relating to his contracts and negotiations with the monarchy and selected by Columbus himself, is presented at length.  A list of seven recommended books written in English and a genealogy of Columbus conclude the document. (JB)",

        "description":"Educators are being called upon by various groups to provide ethics instruction as part of the public schools' curricula. At the same time, teachers are coming under close scrutiny for accountability as well as being subjected to decisions about education made by legislators, school boards, and the courts. Moreover, they are finding themselves caught up in the moral ambiguity that characterizes today's society. Despite public demands for ethics instruction, many educators remain skeptical of such instruction and the kinds of programs that might result from a mandate requiring schools to teach ethics. Research has provided little helpful information upon which to build workable programs of ethics instruction. It is time for everyone who has an interest in ethics instruction to  pause and study the reasons why there are no such curricular components being implemented, why research is not providing the information needed to undergird the creation of such programs, and why some educators are very skeptical about ethics instruction in public schools. It is time for educators to speak out publicly and to demand an answer to the critical question: Whose ethics do we teach? (JB)",

        "description":"Teaching critical thinking is difficult in elementary music instruction because of the limited time devoted to music; yet it must be considered a vital part of music instruction, as students must not only become knowledgeable about music, but should also learn to think intelligently about music. Recommendations for the content of elementary music curricula are provided, which draw heavily from the Music Educators' National Conference (MENC), supplemented by several school music curriculum guides and texts. A major factor influencing the extent and quality of elementary music instruction in the future will be the financial support of the schools. It is hoped that music programs will have a more central role in the total curriculum. Broad goals are set, and eight critical thinking  skills (focusing, information gathering, remembering, organizing, analyzing, generating, integrating, and evaluating) are discussed in light of those goals. The recommended content is considered both from the point of view of minimal instruction by a classroom teacher and instruction 3 to 5 days a week by a music specialist. Recommended teacher competencies drawn from MENC and the author's expertise in music teacher training are discussed. An appendix gives a detailed analysis of a general music lesson indicating how a topic can be taught using critical thinking skills. A 26-item bibliography concludes the document. (JB)",

The DOD commemorative focus is fourfold: (1) to demonstrate the role and relationships of the military in national government; (2) to provide educational and historical lessons for soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, their families, and civilian employees; (3) to instill a sense of the commitment, values, leadership, and public service of the 23 soldier-statesman signers; and (4) to emphasize civilian control over the military. A thorough discussion of the constitutional provisions for the establishment of the first Congress, the Departments of War and Army, and the Office of the President and Commander  in Chief is presented. The military service records of the 23 men who served both in the armed services and as president are given, along with a collection of their memorable quotes. The major DOD commemorative programs are: (1) the Constitutional Commitment Program, emphasizing education and oath reaffirmation; (2) the Bicentennial Defense Community Program, listing the participating defense communities; (3) the Exceptional Merit Recognition Program, with a listing of the 76 commemorative programs so chosen; and (4) the Adopt-A-School Program, an investment in enriching the educational process through defense organization participation. Several activities and ceremonies are recommended. Lists of resource materials and commemorative items are provided.

The number of law suits brought by men alleging sexual harassment is increasing and will likely continue to increase as more women attain supervisory and management positions. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) defines harassment as &quot;unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.&quot; Harassment is further constituted when submission to such conduct is made a condition of employment, submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as a basis for employment decisions, or when such conduct has the effect of interfering with an individual's work performance or of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive  working environment. The harasser need not be the victim's supervisor though often is, and the victim is not necessarily a member of the opposite sex of the harasser. Victims are encouraged to: (1) document their performance following a case of exploitation; (2) attempt to gather evidence (witnesses or tape recordings); (3) utilize an internal grievance procedure; (4) encourage the development of an explicit code of conduct; and (5) become familiar with legal provisions under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

U.S. citizens at that time subscribed to the traditional belief that a spiritual self, grafted onto the body, was the source of life and thought. The later belief that human beings possessed complete, experiential knowledge of their own thoughts was a profound departure from the view that the mind possessed many different abilities. Faith in the immediate availability of self-knowledge supported the northern middle class emphasis on self-control as well as the cult of the self-made man. Despite the enormous confidence in self-perception in the early 19th century, some eventually found reason to doubt the &quot;evidence of consciousness,&quot; and a part of the intellectual  establishment became committed to the concept of unconscious thought. The work of social and cultural historians in our time has suffered by its confinement within the late 19th-century model of mind as divided between conscious and unconscious experience. A discussion of the works of Herbert Gutman, Paul Faler, Paul Johnson, and Mary Ryan is included. The dearth of synthesis in recent historical studies may be due to the difficulty of relating the wealth of discrete research data. But as long as history is conceived of as a local phenomenon experienced in the self, data synthesis will be difficult. By considering history not as resistance to experience but as interpretation of signs we may recognize that history itself is a synthetic process. (PPB)",

A 2-hour pre-internship seminar, taught every spring, is also required. In this course, students learn of internship possibilities; develop resumes and cover letters; participate in a video-taped mock interview; receive a copy of the Professional Practice Packet detailing the rationale behind internships and the responsibilities of student, supervisor, and instructor; and write an essay setting forth their plans and objectives with regard to interning. Files maintained by the instructor contain names and addresses and particulars about internships as well as brochures, products, reports, and the like from the various intern employers. Most internships  are undertaken in the summer to allow a full-time experience similar to real working conditions. Interns are paid by the employers. The supervising instructor visits as many summer interns at their job sites as possible and maintains contact with the employers throughout the year through phone calls, visits, and a newsletter. The list of intern employers was developed by first targeting the areas from which most of the students originated, then by using the yellow pages, word-of-mouth, the job placement center of the University, and the Student Conservation Association which provided catalogs and application materials from their clients. A map of Illinois indicating summer residencies for geography students, 1987-1989, is included. (JB)",

In many ways, the Indian Constitution, its language and provisions, are remarkably similar to the U.S. Constitution. A radio telecast from August 15, 1947 (S. Radhakrishnan) illustrates some of those similarities, as does a side-by-side comparison  of parts of U.S. and Indian Constitutions (preamble, rights to equality, freedom, and constitutional remedies).

The guidelines, based on study, research, discussions, and a consensus-building process, are presented along with 12 background papers by various authors. Three main ideas emerged in the process of developing these guidelines: (1) it is critical for our society to reverse the pattern of school-related difficulties and failures among members of disadvantaged minority groups; (2) STS as a curriculum emphasis has an important and unique contribution to make to the secondary science education of urban and minority students; (3) in order for STS to make this  contribution, it must be shaped to empower the learning of disadvantaged minority youngsters in urban schools, and this situation requires new role relations among teachers and school leaders, learners, and members of the urban minority communities. A formulation of a 1-year course outline for an STS course for urban and minority students is presented, as well as a review of major high school level STS curricula in light of the project guidelines. Also included is a model for infusing STS studies into urban school science curricula. (JB)",

Designed primarily for the marketing community, this edition reports consumer income before and after taxes, the proportion of consumers having discretionary income, and the amount of such income. These figures are broken down according to household characteristics used most frequently by the makers and providers of consumer goods and services. For the purpose of this study, discretionary income is defined as the amount of money which would permit a family to maintain a living  standard comfortably higher than the average for similar families. Data is taken from the March 1987 Current Population Survey.

The East-West Center (Honolulu, Hawaii) has undertaken a project in this direction, the Consortuim for Teaching Asia and the Pacific in the Schools (CTAPS). This project will develop an educational model, which will integrate more Asian-Pacific curriculum topics into the regular K-12 school program in order to prepare Hawaii's students to be competent citizens in a more complex and globally interdependent society. The underlying principles of the CTAPS program are: (1) focus on Asia/Pacific content; (2) collaboration among resource organizations; (3) focus on teachers; (4) a strategy of  leadership team-building; (5) teachers as trainers of other teachers; and (6) access to resources statewide. One of the key elements of CTAPS design will include leadership training for the team through summer institutes, workshops, and curriculum study tours abroad. The other key element is the development of a central curriculum resource library and school-site resource libraries (maintained by the school CTAPS leadership team). The overall goal of the consortium is to provide leadership teams in schools with the capacity to: (1) provide a rationale for including Asia and the Pacific within existing curriculum guidelines; (2) provide leadership in the dissemination of teaching resources; and (3) plan and design a variety of staff development activities at different levels for their  colleagues.

Music educators must be prepared to defend their programs and educational objectives or face a future of extra-curricular status and no credit for student participation in music. This study investigates what has caused the erosion of music education's status within the curriculum, and reviews the implications that eligibility requirements would have on music education. The bibliography is divided into four parts: (1) the history of music education in the public schools (five entries); the curricular, extra-curricular, and co-curricular classification of music  education (10 entries); (3) student eligibility requirements for participation in music education (eight entries); and (4) solutions to the problem and alternatives to music education today (17 entries). Band programs are often considered extra-curricular due to their involvement in outside school competitions, much like athletic teams. The fact that band programs are expensive and are often funded by outside sources also leads to their extra-curricular status. Band directors should justify music on its own merits. The arts add to cognitive learning in the same ways as philosophy, religion, or psychology. A glossary of terms used and recommendations for band directors, educators, and administrators conclude the bibliography. (PPB)",

        "description":"A review of 21 educational change programs supported by 42 World Bank-assisted projects found that the most successful programs have a different profile than the less successful programs. The former aimed at comprehensive change, encompassing a wide range of objectives including administrative and management training and the provision of educational materials as well as the usual curriculum and teacher training components. Most importantly, they adopted an implementation strategy that was congruent with political and economic factors and with the program's objectives. Three factors were found especially critical for successfully implementing educational reform programs: (1) administrative development to strengthen institutions and organizational structure, including the  development of innovative management; (2) significant components for in-service teacher training; and (3) strategies to gain the commitment of implementors, external agencies, and government authorities. The number of children enrolled in schools throughout the developing world has grown substantially. This growth has stretched available managerial, professional, and financial resources beyond the limits of effectiveness. Providing pupils with quality education may overtake providing access to schools as the main goal in educational development in the coming years. The document includes tables, summaries of the 21 programs studied, and a 56-item bibliography. (Author/JB)",

        "description":"New research programs on teaching have examined teacher thinking, reflective teaching, and the possibility of teachers using practical arguments in their teaching. The changes in educational research have their basis in social science conceptions of research, which have shifted through the years. The shift from logical positivism to a more ecologic naturalistic theory of research has led to an increased interest in teacher cognitive processes. This paper is based on the belief that teachers' beliefs, desires, and intentions are as equally important as their behaviors. It proceeds under the belief that the research perspective which takes these cognitive variables completely into account will be the one of most help to teachers and teacher education. The hypothesis of the paper is  that the study of teacher cognitive processes, and especially the study of the use of practical arguments by teachers, can only now, as a result of the shifting social science conceptions, be seriously considered.

The study investigated the personal characteristics of teachers and aspects of their work environment as they related to this multidimensional concept of burnout. It also sought to determine whether high-risk teachers can be identified early in the school year. Subjects were 136 kindergarten through eighth grade teachers. The subjects responded to three questionnaires during the course of the school year. The scales for the study tapped three major dimensions--personal characteristics, the environment, and burnout. The  questionnaires covered background information, coping skills, appraisal, emotions, expectations, school climate, job satisfaction, depression, negative attitudes, absenteeism, illness, visits to the doctor, intention to leave the profession, intention to leave the school, and a burnout inventory. The relationship between burnout and these multidimensional factors is discussed. Recommendations are made for teacher and administrator training. More than a hundred references are cited. (JD)",

Inquiry was also made into what is actually being taught at the secondary level. A two-part questionnaire was addressed to 2,000 secondary principals to obtain data. Responses (N=700) indicated that on the average, the major part of the teaching schedule of teachers of psychology is spent teaching other subjects, i.e., English, history, sociology. Most of the teachers did not major in psychology itself and have taken only a limited number of credit hours in psychology. Social studies is the certification area of most high school psychology teachers. Topics most emphasized by the teachers were personality, development, learning,  mental health, and behavioral disorders. Suggestions are made for improving the preparation of precollege psychology teachers. (JD)",

By mandating that each accredited unit develop a teacher education program founded upon broad knowledge bases, NCATE is effectively requiring some teacher education programs to alter current curricula and practices. The operational definition of &quot;knowledge base&quot; which forms the basis for this paper is drawn from Valli and Tom (1989): &quot;the entire repertoire of skills, information, attitudes, etc., that teachers need to carry out their classroom responsibilities.&quot; Use of the model presented here is designed to insure a professional education program that is coherent  from program philosophy through program evaluation. The model provides for faculty collaboration in the content and design of the curriculum. The use of the model will provide a systematic and orderly process to develop a defensible knowledge-based curriculum in professional education. (JD)",

The study group consisted of 62 members of the junior ballet of the Finnish National Opera, ranging in age from 9 to 17 with the majority under 14. The dancers were given four self-esteem questionnaires which measured empathy, creativity, and other personality factors and a list of interests was also used to measure the dancers' inclinations. Compared with Finnish-speaking school students who acted as a control group, the ballet dancers had a significantly higher interest in music, singing, acting, writing, drawing and handwork, and less interest in technology. It is concluded that ballet mainly develops a junior's self-expression, improves self-esteem and self-respect, creates  self-confidence and develops sensitivity and empathy. (JD)",

The guide has four sections. The first section examines the role of communication in one teacher's classroom. A discussion of this teacher's belief that learning and communication are inseparable serves as the framework for introducing a model of communication which uses concentric circles to emphasize the interaction and integration of individual capacities, the elements of the communication process, and the audience. Goals for developing communication across the curriculum based on the model are presented. The second section identifies abilities and understandings that students use  intuitively as they use language to learn and think in the classroom. The third section explores strategies for incorporating communication across the curriculum. This section suggests that interaction and active construction of meaning through language are important to all learning whether in or out of school. The fourth section discusses how the communication processes and skills used by students flow from the instructional activities in which they are involved and how they can be tailored to students' individual needs and abilities. A &quot;Form for Analyzing Communication Abilities and Understandings Across the Curriculum&quot; is appended to help teachers identify, monitor, and assess the communications skills they use.

A 29-item questionnaire was developed, in cooperation with the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (AACTE), and sent to a proportional stratified random sample of 72 AACTE member institutions. Returns were received from 58, or 80.6 percent, of those surveyed. Chi-Square analyses were conducted between SCDEs which indicated increased and decreased overall and minority enrollments to determine differences in SCDEs' use of specific recruiting strategies. Though no statistically significant differences were  noted, there was a tendency for SCDEs which had experienced increased minority enrollments to also have employed a full-time recruiter. There was also some evidence to suggest that SCDEs which award teacher education scholarships are more likely to attract minority students. However, few SCDEs appear to be actively involved in recruiting minority students. (JD)",

        "description":"This paper discusses new psychometric analyses that improve capabilities for relating performance on achievement test items to instruction received by examinees. The modeling discussion is closely tied to data for eighth graders in the United States provided by the Second International Mathematics Study (SIMS), comprising not only responses to a set of achievement items at the beginning and end of the eighth grade but also a relatively rich set of student background information, including opportunity-to-learn information specific to each item. Taking item response theory (IRT) as a starting point, this paper summarizes B. Muthen's work on a set of new psychometric analysis techniques that give a richer description of achievement-instruction relations. Six topics that expand  standard IRT and deal specifically with the effects of varying instructional opportunities are discussed: (1) variation in IRT measurement characteristics; (2) multidimensional modeling; (3) modeling with heterogeneity levels; (4) estimation of trait scores; (5) predicting achievement by relating trait to student background; and (6) relationship of change in general and specific traits to instructional opportunities. The core test of 40 items used in the SIMS, four tables, and 38 graphs are provided. (TJH)",

        "author":["Byrne, Barbara M."],
        "description":"The construct validity of a multidimensional adolescent self-concept was estimated separately for males and females, and the results were compared across gender. The application of four multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) approaches to estimating construct validity was demonstrated, and the scope and consistency of the findings derived from each were compared. Methodological approaches included: (1) the Campbell-Fiske model of D. T. Campbell and D. W. Fiske (1959); (2) the analysis of variance model of M. J. Kavanagh et al. (1971); (3) the confirmatory factor analysis model of K. G. Joreskog (1969); and (4) the composite direct product model of M. W. Browne (1984). These procedures were applied to data comprising four self-concept traits (general, academic, English, and mathematics) as  measured by three measurement scales (Likert, semantic differential, and Guttman). The sample consisted of 412 males and 420 females in grades 11 and 12 from two suburban high schools in Ottawa (Ontario). Results derived from the composite direct product model are less than optimal. Other results demonstrate that adolescent males and females can differ with respect to various aspects of construct validity related to multidimensional facets of self-concept. Seven tables present study data. (SLD)",

        "description":"The perceptions of teachers about students' lack of success were studied, and the groundwork was laid for the future study of the effectiveness of a policy of warning students and parents of impending failure. The primary sources of data were teacher-coded reasons for failure, given on notices (progress reports) to secondary school students in the Austin (Texas) public schools, and received after 3 weeks of each 6-week marking period. These computer-generated notices have a menu of 11 reasons from which teachers may choose. Data for 16,000 students in 11 high schools and 12,000 students in 13 middle and junior high schools were reviewed. Failure to turn in work was the most common reason for failure; poor performance on quizzes/tests was equally common for grades 9 to 12, but  just over half as common in grades 6 through 8. Excessive absence or tardiness was the third most common reason for failure in grades 9 through 12, with failure to make up work and lack of effort a second tier of reported causes for failure. Middle school students were more likely to fail to bring material to class, and older students were more likely to have excessive absences. Males were cited more frequently than were females in every category. This computerized system forces teachers to reflect on student performance and gives students and parents a warning of the students' impending failure. Further research into the consequences of such warning is warranted. Eighteen tables provide the study results, and a sample progress report and coding sheet are included. (SLD)",

Technical reports became in-house documents and final reports took on a more newsy reporting style, with more and simpler graphics, simpler language, suggestions of actions rather than direct recommendations, standardized report features, an executive summary, and design features to guide the reader to important elements. Positive features of an evaluation report should be: (1)  succinct description of the study; (2) succinct description of the analysis, in an attachment rather than in the text; (3) succinct description of the results; (4) conversational language; (5) simple presentation of numbers; (6) single idea tables; (7) placing complex tables in attachments; (8) simple, single-idea graphics; (9) popular format; (10) attractive report covers; and (11) a descriptive or inspiring title.

A review of national results of the NAEP examination in 1986 has highlighted the gaps in knowledge of this age group. The Austin (Texas) Independent School District (AISD) assessed its students by administering 141 U.S. history and 121 literature items from the NAEP test to 960 high school students in the spring of 1988. Most of the students tested were either 16 or 17 years old at the time of testing. Although problems with the representativeness of the AISD sample and the comparability of AISD and national sample place some limitations on the confidence of the  statement, AISD students outperformed the national sample after both descriptive and inferential analyses. Nationally, 60 of 141 questions were passed (answered correctly by at least 60% of the students), while AISD students passed 86 history questions. In literature, 51 of 121 questions were passed nationally, while AISD students passed 67 of 121 questions. Even though Austin students did better than students nationally, the 61% passing rate in history and 60% passing rate in literature leaves plenty of room for improvement. Six figures give study data.

Most were served through Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE) and English as a Second Language (ESL) programs. Mastery percentages on the Texas Educational Assessment of Minimum Skills (TEAMS) examinations for grades 1 through 9 increased in 8 of 15 comparisons by grade and subject area. Exit-level TEAMS scores for 11th graders indicated that TEAMS must be a special emphasis if LEP students are to graduate on time.  On the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills and the Tests of Achievement and Proficiency, Spanish-speaking students gained over one grade equivalent (GE) between spring 1988 and spring 1989 in about half the comparisons. Vietnamese LEP students gained over one GE in 25 of 36 comparisons.

In 1978-79, the Texas Department of Human Resources (DHR) developed the CNAI to provide an index of applicants' and clients' capacity for self-care by measuring the respondents' levels of functioning in: (1) physical health; (2) daily living activities; (3) mental health; and (4) social resources. It is used to establish eligibility of first-time clients and continued eligibility of clients for services in the DHR's community care programs. L. Guttman's facet theory, based on set theory, was the theoretical basis for the investigation of the instrument's structure. A shortened 20-item version of the CNAI, revised in 1984, was tested with 4,189 clients (aged 20 to 99 years). Correlation matrices  were submitted to Smallest Space Analysis (SSA) to determine the structure of the CNAI. The functional modality facet was expected to play a polar role, partitioning the SSA space into wedge-shaped regions emanating from a common origin. Two-dimensional SSA configurations adequately portrayed the structure of the correlation matrices for the entire population of DHR clients and for clients from two special services, supporting the structure hypothesized for CNAI. This means that CNAI items represent functional behaviors that differ in type rather than degree and that, because these behaviors are unordered, the lack of functional ability in any area does not indicate inability to function in other areas. Four tables and two figures support the study. (SLD)",

The KEEP is an elementary-level language arts program designed for Hawaiian learners. The independent variables concerned were, as follows: quality (program strategies, teaching strategies, program experience, teaching experience, and a composite of eight variables); task-ability match (work completion); motivation (participation); and time (daily instruction, attention, on task when not receiving direct instruction, management, and homework). The achievement of the 40 classrooms, with the median number of students in each classroom being 22, 21, and 25 for the 1st, 2nd,  and 3rd grades, respectively, was measured using the Metropolitan Achievement Tests (MAT). The expected MAT mean for each classroom was estimated from that class's mean ability as measured by the Otis-Lennon School Ability Test. The measure of achievement used in the analysis was the standardized residual of the MAT score from the estimated mean. Only the number of years as a program teacher was related to achievement. This result was found in 2 consecutive years (1985 and 1986), but was puzzling because none of the 12 variables expected to be critical for instructional effectiveness was associated with achievement. Possible explanations are considered. Because the amount of teaching experience with this instructional program was associated with achievement, the results provide  encouraging evidence for the effectiveness of KEEP, although they do not support the effectiveness of current models of instruction.

The direct assessment method chosen involved a variety of writing tasks, including school newsletter announcements, letters, and explanatory essays. The method distinguished among practical, expressive, and school writing. Five writing tasks were developed and field tested for each type of writing. The pilot study also included classroom observation and interviews with teachers  and students. Scoring guides were developed for each writing task. The tasks were administered to a nationally representative sample of 2,590 sixth graders enrolled in a total of 57 schools. Approximately 800 responses were received for each writing task. A team of 12 lay scorers was trained to conduct the scoring. Data are now being analyzed to determine interrelationships between writing types and scoring methods and between test scores and other variables. Preliminary results indicate that the method may have curricular validity but not instructional validity. (TJH)",

        "description":"The factorial validity of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) was studied for 98 elementary school, 163 intermediate school, 162 secondary school, and 218 university teachers in Ottawa (Canada). The equivalence of factorial measurements and structure was tested across the groups. Exploratory factor analyses were used to examine the initial factor structure, and confirmatory factor analyses tested the hypothesized three-factor structure and its invariance across groups. In spite of the findings of a few aberrant items specific to each group, the MBI demonstrated remarkably sound psychometric properties with intermediate and secondary school teachers, less sound properties with university teachers, and poor psychometric properties with elementary school teachers. Tests of  invariance across intermediate and secondary teachers revealed the equivalence of all item measurements for both groups. The results have important implications for substantive studies focusing on multigroup comparisons across teaching levels. Five tables summarize study findings. (SLD)",

The State Education Assessment Center of the Council of Chief State School Officers solicited comments from the states about developing the assessment program. Issues were addressed in a meeting in March 1986 that resulted in the following provisions for state-by-state assessment: (1) that states be convened to establish the broadest possible statements on content and priorities in each subject upon which they can agree; (2) that assessment results be reported in simple, global format in each subject at each grade level; (3) that assessment of reading, writing, and English be alternated with mathematics, so that  basic skills are assessed every other year, with science and social studies assessed every fourth year; and (4) that the Center establish explicit guidelines for all significant procedures in the assessment program. The plan adopted in 1985 had established that assessment activities would be pursued in conjunction with the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). If research shows that NAEP items and exercises are not suitable in the context of these recommendations, assessment activities are to be developed independently with the states. (SLD)",

        "description":"Questions on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) with the largest score differences between women and men of all racial and ethnic groups were identified. Patterns of difficulty that would explain the SAT's continuing underprediction of female first-year college performance were studied. An item analysis of one form of the June 1986 SAT for 1,112 students identified 17 questions with large sex differences. A subsequent item analysis of the November 1987 SAT used the responses of 100,000 high school seniors to identify 23 questions with substantial differences in the numbers of men and women who answered them correctly; 17 of these questions were in the mathematics section. African-American women exhibited the smallest gender gap and Hispanic women the largest when compared with  men within their own racial and ethnic groups. The findings of this and other studies suggest that the test publisher could take steps to address the SAT's underprediction and bias. These are summarized as: (1) elimination of questions of identified bias; (2) testing a more balanced array of skills and knowledge; (3) publicity for validity studies about performance prediction; (4) more research on the correlation between SAT scores and grades; and (5) more test-taking time. Thirty-two supporting tables and nine appendices presenting aspects of the study are provided. A 219-item list of references is included. (SLD)",

Teachers rated students on a variety of personality characteristics and gave their perceptions of the children in the following domains: (1) math; (2) reading; (3) social; (4) sports; (5) music; and (6) art. For each domain, they were asked about constructs of talent, effort, ability, and their expectations for the child. Teachers' ratings were highly correlated  across domains for each construct except for their ratings of the children's abilities. Teachers' ratings were more highly correlated across years for the academic areas than the other areas. Teachers' ratings were also closely related to the children's performance on a battery of cognitive measures, a test of physical ability, and an intelligence test. Teachers were most confident and accurate in areas in which they had the most experience, but it is not known whether the confidence they had in their ability ratings affected their tendencies to act on the ratings.

The approach involved collection of descriptions of learning strategies from undergraduate and graduate students, implementation of a principal components analysis to determine the factor structure of the items, and analysis of the relationship between the resulting factors and academic achievement. Development of the Student Strategic Learning Inventory (SSLI) began with an analysis of extended narratives on learning strategies written by undergraduates. Seventy-nine items were extracted and rated by 65 graduate students, 200 college sophomores, and 56 college juniors and seniors on a four-point scale. To establish construct  validity of the SSLI, upperclassmen raters also completed the Inventory of Learning Processes--a 62-item, true-false instrument recognized in the literature as a measure of learning strategies. Results from both instruments were correlated with grade point average. Only a factor analysis of the items and correlation of the factor scores were used in data analysis. The procedure, beginning with narrative analysis, was repeated with a variety of students, items were added, and a 94-item instrument was the final result. The methodology of soliciting items from learners was successful, and the derived factors supported the theoretical model of learning previously proposed. Four tables are included. (TJH)",

        "description":"The systematic learning program developed and implemented at Columbia Heights Elementary School (CHES) in San Antonio (Texas) in 1986-87 and 1987-88 is described. CHES is located in a low socio-economic neighborhood made up of 99% Mexican Americans and was identified as having one of the lowest quartile test scores in the state in 1986. Forty-two percent of the students have been identified as limited English proficient students. The educational program was developed because of the growing demand for educational accountability by the district. The purpose of the program at CHES was to improve learning and instruction while concurrently providing children with test-taking skills. This paper describes the educational program and its effectiveness in raising academic achievement and  standardized test scores. Over a 2-year period the program consisted of four project activities: (1) practice test program; (2) tutoring program; (3) weekly activities focused to improve test-taking skills; and (4) inservice teacher education on the writing process, on holistic grading, and on six correlates for effective schools. Results have been positive; test scores on achievement tests have improved significantly over the 2-year period. The campus atmosphere has changed dramatically; and parents, teachers, and administrators have become actively involved in helping children to learn and to succeed. Practice tests of minimum skills in reading, writing, and mathematics, and a campus action plan for grades 1 through 3 are appended. (TJH)",

        "description":"This collection of seven reports explores the changes in children's services that have been brought about by efforts to limit local spending and taxation, and by unfavorable economic changes. The four states chosen for analysis--California, Massachusetts, Michigan, and New Jersey--represent contrasting economic circumstances and several different versions of the tax limitation movement. Each report, presented as a chapter in the collection, examines changes in tax burdens and expenditure levels, changes in the decision-making process concerning children's services, and the direct and indirect outcomes of budget reductions on families and children. Chapter 1, &quot;Children's Services in an Era of Uncertainty&quot; (Elliott A. Medrich and Victor Rubin) outlines the development of children's  services in the United States, discusses the effects of recent demographic and economic changes, and reviews the other reports. Chapter 2, &quot;The Tax Limitation Movement of the 1970's: A National Perspective&quot; (C. S. Benson and P. Weinstock), provides an empirical overview of tax limitation efforts and their actual effect on revenues and expenditures for all states. Chapter 3, &quot;Keeping Up With California: The Impact of Massachusetts' Proposition 2-1/2 on Local Children's Services&quot; (K. E. Kim), documents, through case studies, the diversity of responses to revenue loss among the state's towns and cities. Chapter 4, &quot;Responses to Local Fiscal Stress: Privatization and Coproduction of Children's Services in California&quot; (V. Rubin), analyzes the changing relationships between governmental and  non-governmental services in Oakland (California) against the background of similar changes across the state. Chapter 5, &quot;Children's Programs in an Era of Scarce Resources&quot; (C. E. Van Horn, S. Fuhrman, and S. Massart), and Chapter 6, &quot;Children in a Fiscally Distressed Environment: The Case of Michigan&quot; (J. Boulet), combine local case studies with an exploration of the changing relationships between state and local budget-making in New Jersey and Michigan, respectively. Chapter 7, &quot;Fiscal Containment and the Expendable Curriculum&quot; (J. S. Catterall), focuses on how a set of programs in the eight largest school districts in California have been affected by budget constraints. Each report includes extensive statistical data and a list of references. (Author/FMW)",

        "description":"This analysis is the first in a series of seven reports on the ways that the urban fiscal crisis has affected children. It discusses the issue in general, and provides an overview of the other reports. Over the past 100 years, all levels of government have developed public services responsible for the health, education, protection and physical and social development of the young. Common schooling was the earliest service provided by local government, complemented by out-of-school developmental and socialization programs. Even in the best economic periods, the out-of-school programs have been vulnerable to criticism and retrenchment. Changing demographics and a continuing climate of fiscal austerity in state and local government create debate over what services are essential, who  should provide them, and who should pay for them. While the number of children under the age of 18 has declined by 11.6 percent in the last decade, the number of two-earner and single-parent families requiring support and services has increased dramatically. Through the 1970s and the 1980s, numerous states have enacted limits on state and local revenue collections and expenditures. The other reports in this series explore changes in urban children's services caused by tax limitation efforts and by unfavorable economic conditions in California, Massachusetts, Michigan and New Jersey. Each report examines changes in tax burdens and expenditure levels, changes in the decision-making process concerning children's services, and the direct and indirect outcomes of budget reductions on families  and children.

        "description":"This analysis is the second of a series of seven reports on the ways that the urban fiscal crisis has affected children. During the 1970s, as a result of general public disenchantment with government, 39 states (78 percent of the 50 states) appear to have enacted tax limitations that affected children's services. Of these states, 37 imposed restrictions on local governments. Examination of census data indicates that after a period of expansion in the early 1970s, direct state-local expenditures dropped off more sharply than revenues, indicating that factors other than revenue availability were acting to curb expenditures. Tax limitations were installed in those states in which the growth of state-local revenues outstripped growth in personal income. Similarly, states with a high  rate of in-migration were also likely to initiate tax limitations. There appears to be no relationship between changes in educational funding, the largest category of state-local spending, and changes in public school enrollments. Children's services may be particularly vulnerable during a period of public disenchantment because the wealthy &quot;shop around&quot; and pick a community to live in that gives them what they want.

There has been little reorganization of government services on the state, regional, or local level to compensate for the benefits to children lost as a result of local property tax limitations enacted under Proposition 2-1/2 in Massachusetts. Four case studies were developed based on interviews with key local officials and service providers in Arlington, Cambridge, Duxbury, and Springfield (Massachusetts) to illustrate the impact of Proposition 2-1/2 on local political processes and decision-making. The communities were chosen to represent differences in size, political organization, fiscal circumstances, and variety of children's services. Analysis indicates  that the capacity to provide children's services was reduced not only by cutbacks, but by the accompanying decline in morale among public employees. Summary findings about the problem-solving process include the following: (1) public support was an important factor in Arlington and Cambridge where debate focused on quality of services; (2) the close interaction between public and private sectors in Duxbury represents a trend likely to increase in the future; (3) heterogeneous groups of teachers, parents and others combined to find common solutions in Cambridge; (4) focusing on the single issue of public safety obtained limited results in Springfield.

Privatization and coproduction have resulted in short-term gains in the provision of children's services in numerous California communities in response to the tax limitations imposed under Proposition 13. Children's services were particularly vulnerable to budget cuts in recreational, educational and cultural programs. Privatization describes the transfer of the administration and financing of a previously public service to non-governmental organizations; coproduction describes the collaboration of local government with private organizations. The following examples are discussed: (1) management reform; (2) private fundraising; (3) grass-roots volunteerism and  organization; and (4) new non-governmental programs. Oakland (California) is used as a case study of the following applications: (1) coproduction of recreational and cultural services; (2) creation of a new school-age child care program; and (3) fundraising for public schools. Although the short-term benefits of such a pragmatic approach are undisputed, further research is needed to determine the long-term implications for social equity and the political process.

Information was analyzed from a statewide survey of senior administrative officials supplemented by interviews with state and local program managers in the areas of parks and recreation, libraries, and social services, and with representatives of children's advocacy groups. Descriptions of the localities selected and the interviews conducted are included in an appendix. Summary findings include the following:  (1) many children's library activities were eliminated by cuts in State aid and the inability of local government to make up the funding and keep up with escalating costs; (2) parks and recreation departments were more successful than libraries in continuing programs by enlisting volunteers; and (3) social services were most severely affected by federal cuts but organized children's advocates were successful in lobbying the state for replacement funds for day care programs.

Michigan's depressed economy, retrenchment of public finances, and attendant effects on local government have changed both the process of providing services to early adolescents and the nature of the services themselves. Despite significant efforts at budget reform, the decline of the automobile industry, and reductions in Federal support to State and local government seriously eroded Michigan's ability to maintain children's and social services. Most directly affected were several traditionally vulnerable groups, including children, welfare recipients, minorities, female headed households, and the &quot;new poor.&quot; After school day care programs had never been a high  budget priority and were among the first to be eliminated during retrenchment. Demand for all kinds of public services has been rising from welfare recipients, single parent households, and the working poor since high State unemployment levels have prohibited any possibility of their finding additional income from work. Many families have been forced to find alternative solutions, including moving in with relatives, day care by older siblings, and latch-key arrangements. Interviews with program directors and coordinators revealed a limited range of strategies for service delivery involving the use of school personnel and facilities. A chart illustrating state budget adjustments and 12 tables of statistical data are included. A list of informants and their institutional affiliations is  appended. (FMW)",

        "description":"This speech by an official of the U.S. Department of Justice reports on the steps that the Department is taking through its Civil Rights Division to enforce the new Fair Housing Act Amendments, and discusses how the Act fosters a cooperative interagency approach to enforcement. Between passage of the Act and its effective date of March 12, 1989, the Division assisted the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in proposing and promulgating implementation regulations by the deadline laid down in the Act. On the first business day the Act was effective, the Division filed two racial discrimination suits under the Act, a few weeks later filed two pattern or practice cases involving discrimination on the basis of familial status, and most recently filed a suit alleging  discrimination on the basis of handicap. One of the familial status cases resulted in a settlement for damages for both the victim and for the fair housing group involved. This award of cash damages to groups involved in testing and fair housing advocacy furthers the work of enforcing the Act and illustrates the new approach to enforcement. Not only can victims in a housing discrimination case brought by the Department of Justice recover monetary damages, but the Department can intervene in private suits as if they had brought the suit as a pattern or practice case. The new Act also creates a much closer relationship between the Justice Department and HUD, fair housing groups, state and local agencies, the private bar, and the Civil Rights Division. (FMW)",

        "description":"Single parent families, usually headed by women, are transitional in two important senses: they frequently represent a transitional stage between marriages; and they are a symptom of the transition from a \"distributive\" family structure, in which a man provides resources for financially dependent women and children, to a form characterized by less specialized marital roles and more equal sharing of the physical care and financial support of children. This book examines the social and public policy implications of these changes. It is divided into seven chapters. Chapter 1, \"Introduction,\" provides reasons for research and explanations for change. Chapter 2, \"Families Headed by Women: Their Growth and Changing Composition,\" explores recent trends and family demography. Chapter 3,\"Marital Instability,\" examines marriage from psychological, economic, and social perspectives. Chapter 4, \"Race and Family Structure,\" discusses racial family differences and recent trends in female headedness among black families. Chapter 5, \"Welfare and Female-Headed Families,\" examines the roles of eligibility, benefits, and incentives. Chapter 6, \"What Happens to Children in Female-Headed Families?\" evaluates existing knowledge and explores negative consequences for children. Chapter 7, \"The Family in Transition,\" sums up the book's themes and suggests new directions for research and public policy. A bibliography is appended to each chapter. The book includes six appendices providing various types of statistical analysis, 50 statistical tables, and four figures. An author and subject  index is included. (AF)",

        "description":"Recognizing that the economic well-being of older black females is associated with current employment as well as previous work history, this study attempts to determine the extent to which health status influences workforce participation or non-participation by older females, and to ascertain if there are significant differences by race. The study also seeks to identify the relative importance of health, socio-demographic, and economic factors in predicting the employment status of older black women. Background materials cited indicate that the following factors contribute to diminished economic well-being for black females throughout their lifetimes: (1) work history of low-paying jobs; (2) greater unemployment; (3) lower levels of education; (4) lower likelihood of marriage;  and (5) greater likelihood of being heads of households. The economic status of the elderly is surveyed in terms of Social Security, pensions, and the incidence of poverty. The analysis uses data from the Supplement on Aging to the 1984 National Health Interview Survey. Findings indicate that older black females (55-74 years of age) are more likely to be employed than their white counterparts, but are confronted by race, gender, and age discrimination. The report includes 17 tables, and a list of 43 references is appended. (AF)",

        "description":"Academic and social problems of the children of migrant workers are compounded when these families remigrate to their home countries. This study explores patterns of Greek remigrant children's social adjustment and integration in Greek public schools after their families' return to Greece, principally from the Federal Republic of Germany. The social adjustment level of migrant children is defined using the perspectives of teachers, peers, and self; teacher-, peer-, and self-rating instruments were used. The study advances the following hypotheses: (1) Greek remigrant children experience more social adjustment and functioning difficulties than local children; (2) the length of stay in Greece after remigration constitutes a critical factor in the nature and severity of the  children's problems; and (3) language competence is an important variable in the adjustment process. The sample consisted of the following groups of fifth and sixth grade students: (1) &quot;early-return&quot; students who had returned to Greece in 1984 or before; (2) &quot;late-return&quot; students who had returned during the last two academic years; and (3) a control group of classmates of the remigrant students. Late-return and early-return students were found to have varying inter- and intrapersonal difficulties with social isolation and adjustment, suggesting that these students should be recognized as distinct groups with special needs. The study includes 8 tables, 1 figure, and a list of 17 references. (AF)",

The report is divided into three parts. The first part looks at current theories related to work and workforce participation in the economy along with trends in employment of black women in the recent past. While services employment opportunities have allowed black women to move from low paid domestic employment into mainstream occupations and workplaces, deepening economic stress among black families is related to the growth in the proportions of black women who are heading households. The second part examines the services economy in depth and patterns of job  gains and earnings for black women accompanying the vast recent expansion of services. Increasing employment of black women in male-intensive services, transitional service sectors, and female-intensive services are studied. The third section explores impacts of service industries on black women's earnings and future employment. The report includes 11 statistical tables, and 37 references are appended. (AF)",

The following characteristics were found to be associated with participants: (1) males are less likely than females to participate and more likely to exit; (2) Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to participate than are Whites, but exit rates are similar for all racial groups; (3) those with less than a high school education are more likely than high school graduates or college graduates to participate; (4) those in a  nonmarried-couple family were more likely to participate than those in married-couple families or persons not in a family; and (5) full-time workers had the lowest likelihood of participating. The following characteristics were found to be associated with those who exited: (1) those exiting programs seldom had changes in family status and marital status; (2) the majority of those who exited had no significant change in work activity; (3) exiting a program does not necessarily mean an improvement in economic status; and (4) almost one-half of those who exited the Medicaid program had failed to find a new source of health insurance coverage 12 months after leaving.

The 1980 Census, which provides the basis for this report, estimates the number of South Asians at around 400,000, and projections suggest that over one million will have joined the U.S. population by the year 2000. South Asian ethnicity is characterized by comparative &quot;invisibility&quot; to other Americans, entailing uncertainty about &quot;race&quot; and &quot;color,&quot; and ambiguity among South Asians themselves concerning membership in the group. This report focuses on Asian Indians, who make up the majority of South Asians. The Asian Indian community has the highest income for full-time workers, but not the highest per capita household income, of any of the races recorded in the Census,  reflecting a tendency among Asian Indians toward large, single-earner households. High personal incomes correlate largely to advanced educational attainment and concentrations in professional occupations; however, not all occupational groups have high incomes. Asian Indian women have lower labor market participation rates than do women in other Asian groups. Poverty is rare among Asian Indians and stems from different sources from those of the U.S. population overall. The report includes three figures and 23 tables. A list of 36 references is appended.

        "description":"The computer revolution was expected to help American schools to teach traditionally unsuccessful students more effectively and to reduce educational inequalities. Research suggests, however, that computer technology has in many ways actually widened the gap in educational opportunity. Nevertheless, this report finds that computers and collaborative learning environments can be used effectively to develop language and literacy skills in students who have difficulty with traditional teaching methods. Inequities in school computer use result from some of the following factors: (1) unequal access to computers in the home; (2) limited access in ethnic and language minority schools; (3) reductionist teaching approaches; and (4) limited access and applicability for female students.  Research indicates dramatic linguistic and academic improvement when students are given access to problem solving, word processing, and communications software, especially for use in collaborative tasks. The coupling of the process approach and computer use in group writing instruction encourages purposeful social interaction in the classroom and engenders both spoken and written language enrichment. The integration of computers into the language arts curriculum involves female students in technological literacy. Electronic mail has also developed as an important tool in literacy development. Emphasis is placed on the role of skilled teachers in engaging all students through computers. A list of 12 references is appended. (AF)",

        "description":"Scandinavian welfare states are developing a growing new middle class and a growing marginalized, poverty-threatened underclass, reproducing the societal duality caused by labor market structuring. Tightening labor markets, increased dependency on welfare benefits, and substantial decreases in public transfers have combined to create a growing population, the majority living in urban areas, en route to poverty or living on the fringes of a normal life. This paper outlines a project on urban poverty and social movements in the United States reflected from a European perspective. Research indicates that labor market segmentation, characterized by first and second reality states, creates a dual society. Examples of Scandinavian welfare state dualization include the following  instances: (1) social welfare in Sweden; (2) fiscal welfare in Denmark; and (3) occupational welfare in Norway. A model juxtaposing system-world logic, as seen in the labor movement, and life-world logic, as seen in social movements, differentiates between the resources of marginalized persons. Examination of urban poverty in Copenhagen and America suggests the potential power of social movements such as claimants' unions in working toward the redistribution of resources and services. The paper includes 6 figures, 11 tables, and an appendix analyzing demographic trends in Copenhagen as compared to Denmark as a whole. A 53-item list of references is appended. (AF)",

Data were gathered through a 26-question survey and 11 personal interviews. The following findings about Cambodian labor force participation are discussed: (1) Cambodians in Hawaii have a higher labor force participation rate than other refugee groups and the general population; (2) Cambodians in Hawaii have a very low unemployment rate compared to other refugee groups and the general population; and (3) over 50 percent  of Cambodian households in Hawaii are fully self-supporting, compared to 36 percent nationwide. The following possible reasons for the high employment rate are discussed: (1) availability of plentiful jobs in the service sector that require minimal training; (2) fewer language problems; (3) pressure from service providers and peers; (4) lower expectations than members of other ethnic groups; (5) emigration of many who do not want to work from Hawaii to California; (6) relatively long stay of Cambodians in Hawaii; (7) creativity in self-employment; and (8) a tradition that encourages women to work outside the home.

Transiency refers to the number of students who enter and leave during the school year expressed as a percentage rate. Stability refers to the student population that has remained in the school all year expressed as a percentage rate of the starting enrollment. Data were gathered from all regular, magnet, and special education schools relating to the number of students who entered and left each month. Data for continuation and opportunity high schools, community adult schools, and skills centers were not included. Rankings were computed for each group with a district summary. The following findings are reported: (1) schools of choice (magnet schools and  centers) had the highest stability and lowest transiency rates; (2) elementary schools tended to be more stable and less transient when compared to district-wide averages; (3) senior high schools tended to be more transient and less stable when compared to district-wide averages; and (4) the 1987-88 transiency rates appear to be higher than in previous years and the stability rates appear lower due to refinements in the formula used for analysis and do not suggest substantially different transiency and stability patterns. The following statistical data are included on nine tables: (1) overview results for the district; (2) results for elementary, junior high and senior high schools, schools of choice, and special education schools arranged in alphabetical order by school; and (3) summary  rates for transiency and stability since 1968.

The following findings are reported: (1) in June 1987, 29,786 students were retained; (2) the district retention rate dropped from 5.60 percent in June 1984 to 5.06 percent in June 1987; (3) the retention rate for elementary and senior high school students dropped from last year, while retentions for junior high school students rose slightly; (4)  approximately 59 percent of those retained were males; (5) retention rates for high school students (grades 9-12) were several times higher than for elementary (K-6) or junior high (6-9) students; (6) the greatest number of elementary students were retained in grade 1; (7) most secondary students were retained in grade 10 (22.63 percent) and grade 9 (20.03 percent); and (8) although the percentage of black students retained dropped from 6.67 percent in 1986 to 6.07 percent in 1987, these students had the highest retention rate. The appendices comprise a copy of the LAUSD retention policy and five tables of statistical data. (FMW)",

JHSSAP is comprised of the following components: (1) Extended Counseling (EC), providing 8 hours per week of auxiliary counseling at 73 junior high schools for 20 selected at-risk students at each school; (2) Regional Assistance Center Class (RACC), providing small group and individualized academic instruction, personal guidance, and weekly counseling for 15 selected at-risk students in each region; and (3) Opportunity Room (OR), providing remedial instruction and personal guidance with a 20:1 student-to-teacher ratio at selected schools in each region. Information was  gathered from a survey of program participants, counselors and teachers, principals, and coordinators. Each of the three components is evaluated on the degree to which it has improved the following student outcomes: (1) grades; (2) attendance; (3) self-esteem; and (4) self-control. Detailed descriptions of each of the three components include the following information: (1) student characteristics; (2) class and caseload sizes; (3) counseling and teaching techniques; (4) staff training and materials; and (5) various aspects of the coordinator's role.

Participants were chosen using a stratified random sample technique to insure proportional representation. Confidential questionnaires were completed by 3,672 certified staff, 2,108 classified staff, and 10,890 parents in Spring 1987. Survey responses from each group were compiled into &quot;report cards&quot; rating district performance in the areas of curriculum, teaching methods, and instructional materials. In addition, the opinions of parents were compared with those of parents in national surveys. The following conclusions are discussed: (1) in  general, all participants gave the instructional program above-average ratings; (2) parents gave the highest ratings, with a B average, while certified and classified staff gave a B-/C+ average; (3) all groups rated employment preparation for students who were not continuing their education lower than other aspects of the program; and (4) parents felt that student use of drugs and lack of discipline were less problematic than did parents in a national survey, but they were more concerned with parent lack of interest and low teacher pay. The appendices comprise 28 tables of statistical data and copies of the survey instruments, including a Spanish translation of the parent survey. (FMW)",

        "description":"The School District of the City of Saginaw (Michigan) operates a compensatory education delivery system in reading and mathematics consisting of two programs, Elementary and Secondary Academic Achievement (A2). The program was designed to provide direct instruction to 2,613 students in grades 1 through 12. The goal of A2 was to improve the pupils' reading and/or mathematics achievement. Instruction occurred primarily in small group settings outside the regular classroom at the elementary level, and in a regular classroom setting with a reduced number of students at the secondary level. The 1988-89 compensatory education delivery system showed an increase over the previous year in terms of the percentage of grade levels meeting the standard in both reading and mathematics.  Overall, A2 results present a picture of a much improved program, especially at the elementary level; and the results look better than average when compared statewide. The results of the pre- to post-testing of compensatory education students indicate the overall greatest gains in reading were made at the first grade level, but that all grades attained the performance standard except grade 7. Mathematics gains were also greatest at grade 1, but all grades met the standard except grade 7. The findings of a process evaluation report were combined with the data included in this report to develop 11 recommendations for improving program implementation for 1989-90. Extensive statistical data are included in five tables and two appendices. (PJ)",

        "description":"Legislatures and courts have attempted to create equitable formulas for school finance. However, these formulas may have negative effects on educational opportunities for urban students. Comparisons of the per-pupil expenditures of large urban school districts, such as New York, with nearby suburban districts and state-wide averages disclose dramatic inequities. Urban school financing must contend with the following problems: (1) structural features in the State aid system that work against urban districts; (2) increased State control over local budgets; and (3) the decline in urban capacity for school support. Urban districts face higher costs than suburban districts in the following areas: (1) personnel; (2) facilities; and (3) special student needs. The relationship between  school finance and student achievement has been difficult to establish because achievement has traditionally been measured in terms of basic skills and has not considered additional learning opportunities. Suggestions for improving educational equity in urban schools focus on the following areas: (1) increasing federal funding; (2) improving the methods of calculating urban students' needs; and (3) allowing greater local autonomy in determining standards and programs.

        "description":"Even though middle schools are important in retaining at-risk students, the organization and curriculum of most of them do not meet the developmental needs of young adolescents. Improvements should focus on making middle and junior high schools function less like large, impersonal high schools and more like caring, nurturing elementary schools, while offering a challenging, subject-specific curriculum. The size and departmentalized structure of middle schools tend to make students leaving self-contained elementary school classrooms feel vulnerable. The fragmented structure of middle schools allows teachers to specialize in subject areas, but weakens teacher-student relationships. Retaining middle school students in grade does not improve academic achievement and students who are  retained are likely to feel embarrassed and stigmatized. Ability grouping, which becomes formalized in middle schools as academic levels become more fixed and obvious, results in social segregation, the reinforcement of racial stereotypes, and the promotion of negative self-images among minority students. Cooperative learning, where students of all ability levels work together in groups, is suggested as an alternative to tracking. Health education and career education should be emphasized in the curriculum. Teachers in middle grades should receive specialized training in adolescent development as well as in subject areas to improve teacher-student relationships. A list of eight references is appended.

The second chapter gives a rationale for a learner-centered approach to the teaching of AIDS and includes a brief overview of the AIDS epidemic and a description of several styles of health education. The third chapter provides statistics about AIDS; professional and medical explanations of AIDS; lay explanations of AIDS; and information on its transmission, the human  immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody test, life-styles conducive to AIDS transmission, and therapies and medical treatments. The fourth chapter contains eight exercises that have been developed and pilot-tested with more than 200 participants in Learning about AIDS courses in England. Included is information on time and resources needed, instructions on how to run the exercises, and advice on how to handle specific student responses the exercises are likely to elicit. The fifth chapter offers guidelines for developing and evaluating these and other learner-centered materials. The sixth chapter lists printed and human resources available in England.

        "description":"Two adult education programs being conducted in Israel are described in the case studies in this packet. The first case study, by Eitan Israeli, describes a school for parents, teachers, and children established in the 1950s in a distressed moshav (cooperative agricultural settlement) to improve education for both parents and children. About 60 men and women participated in the meetings. The program for each meeting included interaction between teachers and parents; an interaction among parents, children, and a school psychologist; and an enrichment session for parents in areas such as literature, music, and health education. The nonformal learning materials included case studies and examples provided by the participants. Teachers were from the primary school. Although the  experimental school did not entirely accomplish its goals, it did facilitate communication between parents and teachers and thus had a positive effect. The second case, by Rachel Tokatli, compares two literacy programs for adults, one for illiterate people who originally came to Israel in the 1950s and 1960s and the other for recent Ethiopian immigrants. The earlier immigrants, known as the Tehila learners, are mostly Oriental women who had lived in Israel for many years and already knew Hebrew, whereas the Ethiopians are black men who do not know the language and are still coping with other problems. The Tehila learners are volunteers; the Ethiopians are forced to attend. Analysis of these two groups of learners and the processes used to teach them can be useful in determining what works  with any group of illiterates.

Primary data were collected from surveys mailed to directors of all 83 state vocational rehabilitation agencies, with responses received from 79 agencies for a 95 percent return rate. To validate these responses, surveys were sent to a 10 percent random sample of state-approved rehabilitation facilities. Of the 326 facilities contacted, 234 (72 percent) responded. Four regions of the United States were found to have high vacancy rates in several specialties. Region 2 (New York, New Jersey, and the Caribbean) has high vacancy rates in 20 of the 27 specialties studied. The South has high vacancy rates in 9 occupations; the vacancies in 5 of  the 9 represent at least 20 percent of the national vacancies. The Southwest has high vacancy rates in 12 specialties, with the vacancies in 6 being attributed to inadequate education. Vacancies in the Northwest exceed the national average in six specialties. The areas of rehabilitation counseling, rehabilitation administration, and rehabilitation of blind persons were found to have large numbers of unfilled positions. Volume II of this document consists of data tables covering the following topics: regional and national positions and vacancies; regional shortages; state and regional labor profiles; unsatisfactory labor supply by category and region; outside providers by category, region, and state; and training needs by occupation. Appendixes include tables detailing duplicate and  unduplicated counts of training needs for new or current employees by specialty, mean and standard deviations within and between regions, and states within each region.

To prepare them for storage and retrieval, secretaries should take an initial course in word processing, at least one course on using the most popular database management system of the time, and learn to perform a database search on a large central source of information or a computer airline schedule. They should be taught to use a computer program to handle basic accounting functions and to maintain an electronic calendar. Because of the information they will handle, students should be made  aware of the rights to privacy. In order to transmit the company image to clients, they must be able to operate sophisticated telephone equipment, record messages quickly, and make callers feel attended to and comfortable. They should be able to operate such office machines as copiers and facsimile machines. In order to fulfill their function of filtering client contact to administrators, secretarial students should be exposed to identifying and handling common interpersonal situations through simulations.

        "description":"This paper examines several aspects of the private prison debate: (1) How much scope is there for improving the technical and economic efficiency of incarceration through contracting-out to private prison entrepreneurs? (2) Will a fully developed corrections industry be sufficiently competitive to ensure that any efficiency gains are passed on to the taxpayers? and (3) Would contracting-out for prison management create the opportunity for private firms to exercise influence, illegitimately and inefficiently, over public decisions about corrections? This assessment yields the following major conclusions: (1) neither theory nor the limited data that exist suggest that the task of incarceration is very well suited to the advantages offered by profit-seeking organizations--chiefly,  cost consciousness and an aptitude for innovation; (2) there are serious structural barriers to genuine competition for prison management contracts; (3) in general, the enterprise of incarcerating people has relatively little scope for technical progress in trimming costs; (4) even if private-prison corporations succeed in cutting costs, there is unlikely to be sufficient competition in any given community to ensure that the savings result in diminished government budgets for corrections; (5) there is a substantial likelihood that government contracts with prison corporations will fully protect neither the interests of the public nor the prison inmates; (6) although private prisons might not be as unaccountable or inhumane as some critics have predicted, neither do they offer anywhere  near the advantages promoted by their advocates and agents; (7) incarceration today remains a symbolically potent public function; and (8) dismissing widespread uneasiness among policymakers about introducing profits into punishment and corrections requires far more compelling practical advantages than private prisons are likely to deliver.

The program is being offered at 13 diverse sites, primarily under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA). In the first year, the 2,312 applicants were randomly assigned either to an experimental group offered a chance to participate in JOBSTART or to a control group not offered JOBSTART but any other community services. A 12-month follow-up survey yielded 1,401 responses (82 percent). Highlights of the evaluation include the following: (1) JOBSTART participants were more disadvantaged than  youths served by JTPA; (2) median participation was 6 months compared to 3.4 months for JTPA Title IIA participants; (3) participants receiving basic education followed by job training had better educational attainment than those in concurrent education/training programs; (4) JOBSTART participants were substantially more likely to receive high school diplomas or equivalency--however, they earned less than the control group in the short term; (5) job placement was the least successful component; and (6) some constraints were imposed by JTPA performance standards and contracting practices. Lessons were derived for each program component as well as for three program design issues: choice of institutional sponsor, concurrent versus sequential education and training, and brokered versus  in-house sequential program.

        "description":"A study of the labor exchange performance of the Employment Service showed that even after adjusting for differences in economic and demographic conditions, local offices and states varied greatly in their ability to place applicants in jobs. The performance measures examined were placement rate, permanent placement ratio (defined as the percentage of placements in jobs expected to last over 150 days), and placement wage ratio (defined as the average placement wage as a percentage of average community wage). Local offices that were stronger performers tended to be concentrated in certain states, indicating that the policies and practices of individual states may contribute to the variations in performance. The concentrations were not related to the level of resources extended per  applicant. States with higher concentrations of above average performing offices included Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and South Carolina, all of whom had twice the rate of offices with above average performance on all three measures as compared with the national average. Michigan, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and West Virginia all had more than double the national percentage of offices with below average performance for all three measures examined. Although Employment Service workload stayed about the same from 1980 to 1987, fewer offices provide one-on-one assistance during intake or providing counseling or testing services.

A sample of 3,000 Kentucky public managers was mailed a six-page self-administered questionnaire in three waves. A response rate of 49 percent generated 1,467 usable questionnaires. About 69 percent of the respondents were males, 96 percent were white, and 70 percent had college degrees. Preliminary findings included the following: (1) a majority of the respondents agreed that effective public administrators should have college degrees, have some training in public administration, and should be members of professional organizations; (2) about 40 percent of the respondents were members of professional organizations, read professional  journals, and participated in conferences, whereas a much smaller percentage were actually involved in continuing professional education activities; (3) an overwhelming majority of the respondents shared certain public service values, such as quality of service to the public, equal employment opportunity, and responsiveness to public opinion; and (4) a majority of responding administrators were sensitive to the political ecology of public administration and were supportive of the ombudsman role of elected officials on behalf of their constituents. (Report includes 19 tables, the questionnaire, agenda of a management awareness workshop, sample of a management newsletter, and a 182-item bibliography.) (KC)",

ESHEL, one of the leading agencies in developing day-care services in Israel initiated a comprehensive evaluation study of day-care centers to identify variations among different types of centers; to identify populations who do not use the centers and whose needs are not met within the present operational set-up; and to develop a follow-up and feedback system to assist in operating the centers and in guiding their future development. The study is being carried out in 12 day-care centers and five day-care units in old-age homes. Preliminary results from interviews with 423 elderly persons and with directors include the  following: (1) the population that attends the centers has high-risk characteristics; (2) the clients have limited mobility; (3) the clients also have personal care needs; (4) about 30 percent have good mobility and live alone, but have difficulty in household management--the centers provide mainly meals, supervision, and social interaction needs for these people; (5) the centers vary in environment and population served; (6) centers emphasize different services, from personal to professional to social; (7) the clients often want more days to visit the center than can be arranged because of transportation or cost; (8) nursing service is available in most centers (and will be studied extensively later in the project).

        "description":"This document summarizes the findings of a survey of the vocational offerings in Montana secondary schools, using data compiled from the 1987-88 fall reports submitted by local school districts to the Montana Office of Public Instruction. Total vocational enrollment was listed as 41,746. (Students enrolled in more than one vocational class were counted for each class in which they were enrolled.) Service areas and enrollments were agriculture, 2,453; business, 19,625; career education, 269; marketing, 1,115; home economics, 7,211; industrial arts, 6,130; trades and industry, 4,913; and broadcasting, 30. Of the 19,625 students enrolled in business classes, 5,523 were in Typing I; 4,170 were in accounting; and 3,660 were in computer classes. Career education and broadcasting,  although not generally considered vocational, were reported that way on the fall report and, consequently, in this document. The enrollment figure for industrial arts includes those courses definitely labeled industrial arts by the schools and those trade/technical classes identified as introductory. The rest of the trades and technical classes are shown as trades and industry enrollments. Twenty-four percent of Montana high school class periods were vocationally oriented classes. The enrollment figures reflect those students enrolled in vocationally oriented classes rather than only those enrolled in vocationally funded programs or only taught by vocationally certified teachers.

        "description":"A follow-up study was conducted of the 1988 graduates of vocational-technical centers, three community colleges, and Northern Montana College. Data were gathered through a survey form mailed to 714 graduates (from a sample of 1,258), yielding 300 responses (43 percent). Approximately 33 percent of the respondents received a degree in technical studies or business, 16 percent in health, 13 percent in general studies, and 6 percent in agricultural program areas. Some of the findings of the study were as follows: (1) more than one-third of the graduates intend to pursue more education, and about half were undecided; (2) almost three-fourths of the graduates indicated that their completed coursework was good to excellent in meeting their continuing education needs; (3) 87 percent of  the respondents considered their coursework to be of immediate or long-term direct benefit to their career plans; (4) graduates rated ancillary services highly, except placement services, which may have suffered by comparison because of the sluggish economy; and (5) graduates related a high level of satisfaction with the usefulness of the programs and training received for performing their present jobs. The study recommended that annual follow-up studies be conducted in order to ensure that Montana's postsecondary vocational-technical education programs continue to be relevant to student needs and the job market. An addendum supplementing this follow-up study is attached. It contains two tables which relate the employment status of the graduates and reported salary by programs completed.  (KC)",

The report compares accomplishments to goals established for fiscal year 1986; defines reasons for slippage in areas in which goals have not been met; and determines on a statewide basis the average cost per student. Some of the highlights of the report are the following: (1) the program enrolled nearly 50,000 adults; (2) the average cost per student was $130.23; (3) more than 10,000 students received General Educational Development certificates; (4) more than 5,000 completed the eighth grade; (5) full- and part-time administrators and staff numbered more than 1,000; and (6) the majority of classes were conducted in the evenings in secondary and elementary school buildings, and 48  learning centers offered alternative adult education classes on a full-time basis. Recommendations were made for additional funding to improve the programs through the acquisition of new materials and software and upgrading and replacement of materials. More than half of the document consists of 16 appendices and 2 addenda containing statistical tables, administrative forms, addresses of adult education programs, results of a program evaluation, and instructions for preparing an annual performance report.

Testimony centered on the possibility of passing legislation to create a National Service organization that would enable young people, especially disadvantaged youth, to serve their country as volunteers while learning skills and earning a chance for further training and education. Concerns of some witnesses centered on whether such legislation would replace student aid and thereby jeopardize college  funding, and whether a large bureaucracy would be created, while individual youth efforts are already in place and are more effective. Others were supportive of the broad idea but cautious about the wording and implementation of such legislation. (KC)",

The demographic characteristics of the target population were studied, as well as past and current federally-assisted employment, education, and training programs. Case studies of current community programs were commissioned. The following are among the findings reported: (1) young people (most of them poor, Hispanic, and/or Black) who lack basic skills and who have failed to graduate from high school have the most difficulty in entering the labor market; (2) approximately 2.5 to 3.5 million of the 18 million students who  are aged 9-15 are at risk; (3) at-risk students are overwhelmingly urban; (4) few past or current programs have targeted this age group; (5) the Job Training Partnership Act authorizes two current programs that serve 14- and 15-year-olds, including a summer youth employment program that is showing positive results in terms of school retention and improved learning retention; and (6) all of the case studies indicate the need to involve employers in the dropout prevention activities.

Because of the growing demand for and shrinking supply of skilled workers, economic success--of the nation and of individual members of the work force--is increasingly tied to educational and occupational attainments. Unless the nation increases its investment in educating and training noncollege-bound students, it faces two grave risks: overall economic growth will slow and unskilled workers will suffer diminishing economic prospects. The nation's economic success in the coming decades will depend on how well it meets, with investments in human capital in the classroom or on the job, the following imperatives that are raising the demand for skilled workers: (1) the technological imperative; (2) the  trade expansion imperative; and (3) the entrepreneurial imperative. Occupational education is a way to get a job, leads to on-the-job training, leads to careers, fosters entrepreneurship, is an avenue to opportunity for the economically disadvantaged, and increases the flexibility of the economy by retooling the work force when existing skills and industries become obsolete. Annual U.S. investments in human capital already equal its investments in plants and equipment and exceed any other nation's. Education and training institutions--not Wall Street bankers--will be responsible for making most of the nation's productive investments. (CML)",

        "description":"A study was conducted jointly by Women in the Building Trades (WIBT), and the Wellesley Center for Research on Women to learn about the experiences of women in the building trades. A questionnaire was distributed at a state conference and mailed to the mailing list of WIBT. All told, 431 questionnaires were distributed, and 131 (30%) were completed and returned, representing about 10% of women in the trades in Massachusetts. All of the women had a high school diploma or equivalent; one in four had some college or business school training; 29% had completed trade school or an apprenticeship, and about as many had a 4-year college degree or more. These women come from all walks of life and are interested in the trades for the same reasons as men--better pay, challenging work, and  an opportunity to learn a skill. Almost half came from families whose men were employed in the trades. Many received their training through apprenticeship and on the job. Respondents identified the importance of getting the first job as an important step in entering the trades. Many indicated that their trade meant more independence, financial security, and a greater sense of self-esteem and competence. However, many said that they must continually prove themselves competent and were more likely to experience hostility and harassment. (NLL)",

        "description":"This paper examines trends and issues in international agricultural extension and offers seven reasons for the establishment of extension systems after World War II. It makes the case that, although the general situation is somewhat similar today, three current developments color and shape extension and may cause its demise: (1) institutional attack of public extension over its cost and financing; (2) controversy over which system model of extension is preferable; and (3) disagreements over what lessons have been learned from the extension literature. Re-examination of the three developments reveals several basic truths: (1) every situation is different; (2) extension models must be considered with respect to the specific situation; (3) economic sustainability is a primary  consideration in program/project development; and (4) extension systems must be flexible and change with changing policies, technologies, and the needs of farmers. The implications of these developments for the U.S. Cooperative Extension Service are that (1) domestic experience is both valuable and limited; (2) it needs to know more about other extension systems and their strengths and weaknesses; (3) there is no one best system/model; (4) in principle extension is flexible, but procedures are needed to ensure that its organization evolves along with changes in its target audiences and technologies; (5) the costs and financing of public extension are paramount concerns; (6) economic sustainability is a main consideration in program/project development; and (7) it is time to stop ignoring  the U.S. organizational experience.

        "description":"The Rutgers Train the Trainer Program (RTTP) is a 2-day intensive workshop for teaching noncareer prospective teachers. Seven essential principles of the program are as follows: (1) teachers of prospective teachers should model the elements of effective teaching; (2) teachers should adopt an overall approach to their students that centers on mutuality and joint purpose; (3) teachers should strive to create a sense of group belonging among the participants; (4) teachers should use a range of whole group, small group, and individual teacher-student approaches to teaching; (5) teachers should develop content by building on the contributions of the students; (6) practice teaching for prospective teachers should be real, not simulated; (7) teachers of prospective teachers should  provide meaningful feedback during coursework and after each practice teaching experience. Student training objectives are skill acquisition and knowledge including (1) an understanding of the characteristics of desirable two-way communication; (2) strategies for effective teacher questioning and fielding of student talk; (3) the characteristics of three basic strategies of teaching--presenting, enabling, and exemplifying; (4) understanding of the relationships occurring within the triad of teacher, student, and subject matter; (5) the role of analogies, anecdotes, metaphors, examples, and parallel cases in giving explanations; (6) the fundamental questions to answer when preparing a lesson plan; and (7) ability to prepare various types of audiovisual materials and understand their role  in the classroom.

        "description":"Although the majority of researchers are probably in agreement regarding the existence of childhood depression, there is less than consensus regarding its structure. In this study age-related differences in child and adolescent self-reports of depression were assessed using two different analytic strategies. Subjects were children (N=515) and adolescents (N=768) who were seeking or receiving services at in- and out-patient mental health facilities. Children's and adolescents' self-reports of depression were compared to determine if the levels of individual symptoms and associated features varied as a function of age. Second, the impact of age on the relations between symptoms was examined, testing for developmental differences in factor patterns of self-reported depression. The  results of the study suggest a number of important parallels between childhood and adolescent depression. The adolescents and children differed significantly on only 3 of 26 of the Children's Depression Inventory items, with the children scoring higher on a somatic and an externalizing item, and the adolescents scoring higher on a relatively abstract item pertaining to worrying. In sum, whereas child versus adolescent differences in associated features were notable, other differences were less than striking, suggesting that self-expression of depressive symptomatology may be less marked than might be expected.

The practice in this carefully-tested, 15-lesson curriculum comes in the form of role plays, class discussions, and homework assignments that focus on helping students to improve interpersonal skills and to gain confidence in their ability to manage difficult situations. The introduction states that this distinctly active approach to teenage pregnancy prevention is based on a promising educational model that combines cognitive and social skills training. While providing information about abstinence, contraception, and sexually transmitted diseases, this document blends the facts with a  series of skill-building exercises. The curriculum thoroughly covers the advantages of sexual abstinence and encourages teenagers to choose abstinence through several skills integration lessons. For those teenagers who are already sexually active, the curriculum reinforces the use of contraceptives. Homework assignments are included that give students the opportunity to interview their parents or guardians about their attitudes about abstinence and sexuality. The curriculum also provides detailed \"Parent Notification and Permission\" guidelines for educators, which address informed consent for student participation in the program. (ABL)",

Homework assignments include talking to parents about contraception and teenage pregnancy, shopping for contraceptives, visiting a clinic, and imagining how a sexually transmitted disease would affect the teenager's life.  Worksheets are provided on the meaning of abstinence to the student, handling crisis situations, birth control myths and truths, self-examination about avoiding pregnancy, and sticking with contraception and abstinence. Handouts are included on possible delaying tactics, situations requiring decisions about contraception, and a vignette about the changes in a girl and boy's relationship.

To determine what they have been doing since graduation the Department of Evaluation Services in conjunction with the Office of Adult and Continuing Education developed a 10-item telephone survey. In addition to collecting graduate follow-up information the survey was designed to act as a recruitment vehicle for Project Great which serves 19- and 20-year-olds with career guidance and vocational training experiences free of charge to participants. The survey directed respondents to identify their educational and/or employment status, specify the perceived problems they encountered either in the work force or post-high school education, and describe their present occupation or the one they are pursuing  through their present education. The results of the study indicated that: (1) over one-half of the graduates were enrolled in some kind of educational program; (2) 10 months after graduation slightly over 10 percent of the students were unemployed; (3) most employed graduates were employed in relatively unskilled jobs; (4) almost one-half of the graduates were employed in personal services industries; (5) approximately 80 percent of the graduates in school were enrolled in 2- or 4-year colleges; and (6) the most common serious educational problems were the lack of basic educational skills, money problems, and lack of study habits.

Most recently the use of the term \"Jewish American Princess\" (JAP) has raised a new cause for concern. This study examined the attitudes of college students towards students labeled as JAPs. The Situational Attitude Scale was used to measure the negative attitudes of non-Jewish college students (N=113) towards Jews and JAPs. Situations were presented in three forms in which the person was neutral, a Jewish person, and a JAP. Results were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance. In 5 out of 10 situations, the subjects responded differently depending upon the form that they received. The results indicated that there  were negative attitudes towards JAPs, but not towards Jewish persons.

The second chapter discusses the role of schools in suicide prevention, including in loco parentis, the Kelson case which held that parents of a child who committed suicide could take action against the school, handling of potential suicide cases, limitations of the school's role, and components of a suicide intervention  program. The third chapter discusses the crisis team approach focusing on who should be involved, crisis team responsibilities, and other approaches.

Counselors need to be willing to learn more about these minorities and how to better meet their needs. Many colleges offering counseling programs include multicultural education. Counselors must be aware of their own cultural values and prejudices before they can help clients from minority backgrounds. This document contains an annotated bibliography of recent research studies concerning minority students and multicultural education for counselor trainees. A review of the literature annotated revealed that minority students needed help in facing the challenges presented by the typical white, middle class school system and that  counselors needed to have multicultural counseling skills to help students from minority racial and ethnic groups. It is suggested that by focusing on multicultural education and efforts, counselors can become culturally experienced, enabling all students to have access to quality guidance and counseling services. Descriptive annotations of published research studies examined are presented in these categories: (1) counseling black students; (2) counseling Hispanics and American Indians; (3) counseling other racial and ethnic groups and at-risk students; (4) counseling and sex bias; (5) counseling and the homosexual student; (6) general concerns of minorities; (7) general issues in multicultural counseling; and (8) methodology for multicultural counseling and curriculum.

The first chapter defines nine categories of students at risk: limited background attainments; personal development difficulties; physical deprivation; disease and illness; neglect or abuse; emotional handicaps; nonscholarly tendencies; substance addiction; and antisocial tendencies. The second chapter describes factors leading to at-risk students' problems, including personal/psychological factors; family environment factors; community environment factors; and school environment factors. Actions to take with students at-risk are discussed in the third chapter. Suggestions are provided for activities or programs in the areas of identification; referral to specialists; caring and mentoring; providing individual  success through adapted instruction; cooperative learning; recognizing and rewarding progress; and strong programs on substance dependency. Parent involvement in preventing and promoting student problems is discussed in the fourth chapter. Finally long-term prevention planning in the areas of early childhood programs, humanizing schools to meet individual needs, and character and cultural development is discussed.

        "description":"Since understanding homeless students and their families is the beginning of the teacher's response to the problem, this monograph is designed to acquaint the teacher with the variety of issues involved in being homeless. The introduction to the document discusses the number of homeless families, the necessity for schools to respond quickly to homeless students before they leave, and the school as a safe haven for the child. Chapter one provides a brief history of homelessness and an explanation of why so many families today are undergoing this trauma. Chapter two provides a picture of homeless students and their families. It includes a graph of the typical cycle of homelessness which includes numerous life crises for the homeless family. Chapter three describes some of the  problems these students may have in the classroom and suggests ways to address these problems. Chapter four discusses what teachers can do to help beyond the classroom setting. The emphasis throughout these pages is on the importance for educators to take a proactive stance on a problem that promises to get worse before it gets better. A glossary of homelessness terms, such as wet shelters, is included. A commentary on homeless children by Mary Hatwood Futrell, president of the National Education Association; a list of advocacy organizations for the homeless; and sample student assessment and parent release forms are included.

No single person or organization alone is capable of, nor responsible for solving the substance abuse problem. It is now important that schools establish partnerships with the community to develop and implement appropriate programs to foster healthy adolescent development. Positive reinforcement should be given to drug-free activities that keep the community message consistent and clear. Dade County, Florida youth face grave dangers in the fight against drug abuse. Availability and acceptance of drugs in Miami, Florida requires problem solving efforts by families, schools, and community organizations. Schools can engage the community to help win the war against drug abuse. To achieve success schools  need to support parents, non-parents, the business community, and others. The most successful drug prevention programs recognize prevention as an ongoing process that changes from day-to-day and is different in every community. A good program acknowledges that drugs are here to stay. Drug abuse is not just a school problem, it is a community problem. If the family unit is to survive as society's most powerful institution, it must join forces with the community to gain the support of its added strength that insures everyone within the community a future firmly rooted in community education.

        "description":"Little empirical research has focused on whether comprehensive service programs for pregnant teenagers and teenage parents have helped to prevent or reduce the occurrence of subsequent pregnancies. This 4-year follow-up study evaluated what impact 8 services provided by a nonprofit agency have had on preventing repeat pregnancies, including increasing the length of time before a subsequent pregnancy. Subjects (N=52) were unmarried black adolescent girls who were pregnant with their first child at the time they became affiliated with the agency. Based on agency records and staff interviews, the adolescent mothers were rated on their average level of involvement in each of the 8 services during the subsequent 2-year period after their initial referral to the agency. The  adolescents' repeat-pregnancy outcomes were then assessed 4 years after their initial referral to the agency. The results of regression analyses indicated that adolescent mothers who had a higher level of participation in two combined pre- and post-birth service programs were significantly more likely to experience a longer period of time after their first pregnancy without a repeat or subsequent pregnancy.

This study examined how individual differences (e.g. ability and gender) may affect learning outcomes when acquiring computer skills. Subjects (N=347) were college students who took a computer literacy course from a college of business administration designed to allow the student to be more efficient in a work environment employing computers. The course involved both lecture and hands-on practice with computers. Students were divided into three groups based on their grade point averages and whether they had taken a computer course previously. Analyses of the data indicated that women tended to be more successful than men in transforming practice effort with the computer into higher  learning performance for various ability groups. Lower ability students benefited primarily from attending an earlier computer science class in the hands-on section of the subsequent computer literacy course for office settings. The results obtained question some assumptions made in the literature about what constitutes efficient training for acquisition of computer skills. (Author/ABL)",

The Alberta Catholic high schools recognized many similarities between this course and their own Religious Studies Program. An in-depth curriculum analysis was undertaken which compared the core and compulsory themes and selected elective themes in Religious Studies with the Career and Life Management core curriculum. This comparison considered the time spent on each topic, the instructional focus or emphasis, and the anticipated learning or behavioral outcome. It was found that with careful planning and good communication the programs complemented rather than duplicated each other. In the Catholic schools, program  integrity was determined to mean that the Career and Life management course should be viewed within the philosophy of God's empowerment and personal free response. Two alternatives were devised in which schools could choose a discrete Career and Life Management course or could offer a modified course in conjunction with Religious Studies courses. In order to work out local instructional plans, cooperation between teachers and school administrators is needed.

The purpose of this study was to contribute to existing dropout-prevention research by identifying and validating reliable decision rules for differentiating actual dropouts from high school completers. A review of the literature resulted in the identification of 43 variables being used by different program personnel to identify the potential dropouts. A tally was completed reflecting the number of times each variable occurred across the 100 dropout prevention programs reviewed. Of these programs, 13 specific procedures were found that had necessary conditions for comparison and evaluation. Once the 13 procedures were  selected, a search was conducted in the High School and Beyond (HS&amp;B) database for elements that could be used to operationally define the variables listed in each of the 13 selected dropout identification procedures. The operationally defined variables were then used to predict which students in the HS&amp;B database would be dropouts. The results of those evaluations were then compared to known dropout figures available for the HS&amp;B sample. The results suggest that the best procedures for predicting dropouts were the Dropout Prediction Instrument, Potential Dropout Profile, Dropout Prediction Equation, and Identifying Potential Dropouts Scale.

In this study objective career achievement was defined as referring to what society considers actual achievement, and perceived career achievement as referring to the individual's subjective, personal standards of career achievement. This study investigated the interrelationships between objective and perceived career achievement and career choices, success criteria, family variables, and demographics. It also examined vocational congruence between career and the individual. The congruence model was tested using both objective and  subjective measures. Subjects (N=215) were managers from a variety of organizations. Analyses indicated that demographic and family variables relate to individual perceptions of career achievement as well as to objective indicators of career achievement within a corporate hierarchy. While the applicability of the general congruence model in career research seems limited based on this study's results, the functional congruence model is supported with the data obtained.

Social support has been identified as a potentially important moderator of the stress-illness relationship. In this study, hardiness in a sample of police officers was examined. Subjects (N=60) were police officers from seven suburban police departments who completed a questionnaire which measured life stress, police stress, strain, illness, absence from work, and hardiness. Six months later all variables except hardiness were measured again. The results of hierarchical regression analyses indicated that hardy police officers had less concurrent strain, future strain, concurrent illness, and future illness. Police officers who had high police stress tended to have a high  level of future illness and future absence from work. Further, the interaction between hardiness and police stress on future absence from work was significant. Thus, hardy police officers with a high level of police stress tended to have a higher level of absence from work than hardy officers with a low level of police stress, while nonhardy police officers experienced a high level of absence from work regardless of their job related stress. Future research should examine police officers' long-term health and their subjective and objective reactions to stress. (57 references) (Author/ABL)",

In this study the relationships between two aspects of role quality in women's three social roles (paid employee, partner, and parent) and three health measures (psychological well-being, psychological distress, and physical symptoms) were examined. Subjects (N=403) were women health-care providers, licensed practical nurses and social workers, who varied in partnership and parental status. Role quality was defined as a complex construct consisting of two aspects: level of benefit and level of employment. The results indicated that level of benefit, the rewards minus the concerns women experienced in  each of her social roles, was consistently and significantly associated with each of the three health measures. For each social role, those women who reported higher levels of rewards compared to concerns also reported higher levels of well-being, lower levels of psychological distress, and fewer physical symptoms. In sharp contrast, level of involvement, the total amount of rewards and concerns experienced in a role, was a significant predictor in only one model; among employed mothers, higher levels of involvement in the parenting role were associated with reports of more symptoms of psychological distress.

The purposes of the survey were to collect information on the characteristics of state programs using a standard set of questions and to determine trends in state HIV/AIDS programs by comparing the data to results from 1987. The results indicated that 41 states had a curriculum guide for HIV/AIDS education, an increase of 13 states over the previous year. As more states developed state curriculum or guidelines for HIV/AIDS education, the critical topics were being covered in an increasing proportion of states.

Not only must the counselor deal with the problems of re-programming the worker, but he or she must also deal with the worker's own loss and feelings of worthlessness. The import of the counselor who successfully works with the unemployed is immeasurable. The key to understanding the unemployment process and examining the client's self-image includes a knowledge of the stages of job loss (shock, denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance) which are similar to the stages in the grieving process. It is also necessary to be able to identify the stages of job search burnout, which begins with enthusiasm and then moves to stagnation, frustration, and finally apathy. In a counseling  center for dislocated persons all areas of the self would be covered: spiritual, cultural, intellectual, moral, physical, social, and economic. When nothing is more important than being a success, it is crucial in working with dislocated persons that all areas of the true self be developed. Above all, a counseling center working with these persons must imbed in their clients the ability to look forward to change, to the new person the client is becoming. The pain that overwhelms one is nurturing the inner self. It is necessary to trust the gift of change. (ABL)",

The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is a pragmatic but compassionate attempt to improve performance by constructing therapeutic strategies to help employees deal with their personal problems. Employee Assistance Programs began in the 1940s with companies providing assistance to employees for alcoholism. In the 1970s programs began to shift their emphasis to encompass a broad range of employee problems. In the 1980s the focus of the programs has changed to employee assistance. The elements of an EAP include assessment, treatment, and continuing  recovery program. Both labor and management should support the EAP goal of assisting the employee with a problem because troubled employees affect both management and labor. The major difficulties facing people are alcohol, drug, mental health, marital, family, financial, legal, job, and medical problems. Procedures should be clearly stated. Education, training, review and record keeping are some of an EAP's activities. The success of an EAP is measured by the number of individuals who return to a productive life. An EAP is an essential component for corporations in today's world for humanitarian and economic reasons. (ABL)",

Although women consume less alcohol than men, alcohol has a greater intoxicating effect for women than for men because of the differences in body water content and proportion of fatty tissue. The prevalence rate of drinking is virtually identical for college men and women. The relationship between women's drinking and their working status is ambiguous. It has been found that women are more likely to drink in private settings while men are more likely to drink in public settings. Women's drinking is strongly linked to the amount and patterns of drinking of people in their social environments. There is a greater stigma attached to female intoxication than to male intoxication. There is  no real evidence of a significant increase in rates of female alcoholism. There are more facilities for women alcoholics than there were formerly and facilities for women are probably more used than they were in earlier decades. Antecedent factors for women's alcoholism include alcoholic relatives, family of origin problems, childhood depression, and drinking at a young age. Women alcoholics differ from men in the age of onset of drinking, drinking alone, polydrug use, and suicidal ideation. Medical consequences of heavy drinking are accelerated for women. Social consequences take the form of troubled relationships. Women alcoholics have low self-esteem. Primary prevention is directed toward the abolition or nonexistence of problem drinking. Secondary prevention is involved in the early  detection efforts of employee assistance programs. (ABL)",

Four research areas useful to educators, therapists, and adults raised by alcoholic parents are transmission of alcoholism, family disruption, personality, and general studies of adaptation. Adults who were raised by alcoholic parents have had different developmental experiences than adults who were not raised by alcoholic parents. Adult children of  alcoholics are considered a population at risk. Group therapy and family therapy are two treatments currently being used with ACoAs.

To date, the most consistent findings among school-aged children are reports of cognitive differences. Health problems, drinking-related traffic accidents, and negative socioeconomic consequences are the more visible adverse effects of alcohol abuse. Children of alcoholics have frequently been labeled as children at risk. These children are more likely to develop alcoholism or other behavior disorders than other children. Specific risk factors and protective factors for children growing up in alcoholic families have not yet been identified. While the  literature on adult children of alcoholics is replete with anecdotes about the permeation of feelings of helplessness during childhood, the research on learned helplessness in children of alcoholics is sparse. Retrospective reports of adult alcoholics often indicate childhood problems with impulsive behavior. Other research has shown that alcoholism in the father represents a high psychopathic risk to the child's primary personality structure. No single biological marker distinguishing children of alcoholics from others has been found. Children of alcoholics have typically performed at lower cognitive levels than children of nonalcoholics. Given the state of research on school-aged children of alcoholics, it is safe to conclude that it is not known what causes alcoholism. (Resources for  families of alcoholics are listed.) (ABL)",

        "description":"Alcoholic beverages have been used throughout American history but their use has always been controversial. Ethyl alcohol is one of the few alcohols man is able to drink, although it is never full strength. The fermentation process is used to manufacture alcoholic beverages. Wines are made from a variety of fruits. Beer is made from yeast and a malted cereal such as corn, rye, wheat, or barley. Distilled beverages, often called spirits, are mainly flavored alcohol and water. These include whiskey, gin, vodka, rum, brandies, and liqueurs. Alcohol has been drunk by some people since the beginning of civilized man. For most people who drink alcoholic beverages alcohol does not cause problems. About 30 percent of Americans are abstainers. For the most part alcohol is introduced to  children in the home, usually between the ages of 10 and 13. Alcohol acts directly on the brain and changes its ability to work with the effects related directly to the concentration of alcohol in the blood. Alcohol is absorbed through the stomach and the small intestine into the bloodstream. Most of the alcohol leaves the body through oxidation and produces calories. Federal laws on alcoholic beverages regulate the production of the beverages and the portion of alcohol contained in the product. Laws related to alcoholic beverages availability are controlled by state and local authorities. Alcoholism is a chronic and usually progressive disease. Fortunately, alcoholism can be successfully treated. (Resources on alcoholism are listed.) (ABL)",

Specifically, this booklet compares what behavioral scientists knew about alcohol abuse and alcoholism in 1935 and what they knew and could do about them in 1985. Contributions were chosen that meet these criteria: they are of clinical as well as scientific significance; they were the object of serious scientific study; and behavioral scientists have been extensively involved in these fields of enquiry. The four areas of focus include: behavioral pathology, etiology, treatment, and prevention. In the area of behavioral pathology, the theories of behavioral tolerance, craving and loss of control, alcoholism and  moral insanity, alcoholism and depression, and alcoholism as a disorder of man are discussed. Theories of etiology in 1935 and 1985 are compared. Treatment regimes and prevention approaches in 1935 and 1985 are also compared. The report concludes that significant progress has been made in the past 50 years on identifying and understanding important effects of alcohol on human behavior, but progress in research on factors other than genetic predisposition has been limited by the expense, complexity, and difficulty of longitudinal research.

        "description":"The thousands of different drugs on the market can be separated into two categories: drugs that affect behavior, called psychoactive drugs, and drugs that do not affect behavior. Drugs get into the body by mouth, inhalation into the lungs, by injection into a vein, muscle or under the skin, and by absorption through mucous membranes. Regardless of the route most drugs must get into the circulatory system in order to travel to the target organ and exert an effect. Once in the circulation a drug must still pass several &quot;barriers&quot; before reaching its site of action and producing a change in behavior. Three of these barriers are the blood capillaries, the blood-brain barrier, and the placental barrier. The brain receives, integrates, and responds to sensory information it receives  from peripheral organs and their receptors, and in addition is responsible for all cognitive functions. Changes in brain cells are responsible for all behavior, including those changes in behavior produced by psychoactive drugs. All psychoactive drugs produce their effects by altering the functional activity of neurotransmitters. Psychoactive drugs can increase or decrease the functional activity of various neurotransmitters. There are five major classifications of psychoactive drugs: stimulants, anti-psychotics, sedatives/hypnotics, opiates or narcotics, and psychedelics or hallucinogens. The termination of drug action is accomplished primarily by changing it to another molecular structure so that it is no longer an active agent or so that it can be removed from the body. Many  psychoactive drugs can produce tolerance or dependence. (ABL)",

Education about alcohol use that assumes the learners have and are having some actual experience is necessary but remains \"difficult\" for many teachers in many school settings. The majority of Americans do not favor a return to Prohibition but is increasingly restive about the obvious harm that is associated with alcohol consumption, particularly in accidents involving drunk drivers. The best premise is that education which involves students actively in the thinking and learning processes is the method most likely to help bring about some more relevant way for this culture to consider the use, nonuse, and  misuse of alcoholic beverages. The selection of facts for alcohol education is a matter of judgment, but should include such things as the effects of alcohol, concentrations of alcohol in various beverages, and the fact that alcoholism is a treatable illness. Each teacher develops a certain style of teaching which reflects his personality and seems appropriate for the majority of students being taught. The learning experience may be more important for lower-class youth than for middle-class youth. Alcohol education is a unique context in which to see humans, beverages, and environments in dynamic interaction. Teaching materials can include those which stimulate thought or which provide information. Education about drinking must make it clear that a lack of agreement about alcohol use  exists. (ABL)",

This study sought to determine the personal incidences of child abuse experienced by high school seniors in public high schools in a mainly rural region of middle Tennessee. The study also investigated the effects of child abuse upon the lives and behavior of its victims. Subjects (N=275) were 18-year-olds who responded to a 15-item questionnaire requesting information on their life experiences. Approximately 28 percent of the participants reported having experienced abuse, with the greatest percentage reporting abuse from birth through 5 years of age.  The most common forms of neglect were lack of emotional support and failure to provide adequate affection. The most common form of physical abuse was being slapped or punched; the most common form of psychological abuse was verbal attack. Sexual abuse was reported by 10 percent of subjects. Caring adults should devise strategies to decrease the incidences of child abuse and proper treatment should be provided to those in need. (ABL)",

        "description":"Because there is no cure or vaccine for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), many authorities have recommended education as the primary means for controlling the spread of the disease. However, knowledge about AIDS represents a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for reduction of risky behavior. Although hetereosexual high school and college students have a low incidence of AIDS at the present time, the potential for AIDS to spread in the adolescent population is present. This study examined the relationship of sexual responsibility to AIDS knowledge in male (N=41) and female (N=45) high school students. Subjects' knowledge about AIDS and sexual responsibility was assessed through self-report questionnaires. The results indicated that sexual responsibility correlated  with AIDS knowledge. Females were more sexually responsible than males. There were important gaps and misconceptions in students knowledge about AIDS; students knew more about transmission and risk groups than they did about basic medical facts. The results revealed a clear need to continue to focus education for today's adolescents on behavioral, emotional, and personality changes needed to foster responsible sexual behavior. (Author/ABL)",

        "description":"Women have been believed to be peacemakers throughout the centuries. Whether this is biologically determined or a socially structured has been a matter of controversy. This study examined gender differences and the social dynamics of peace movement participation. Subjects (N=272) were members of a local nuclear freeze campaign in 1984. Discriminant analysis and difference of means tests were applied to survey data to discern demographic, resource, attitudinal, and ideological characteristics that distinguished female and male participants. Very few differences were found and some were expected due to larger societal differences. However, subtle attitudinal differences revealed that women were less likely to believe in the utility of nuclear weapons and to minimize the strength of  the United State's arsenal, demonstrating women's greater likelihood to take more risks than men. It is important to keep these differences in mind in terms of recruitment and education in order to avoid fostering a gender gap within peace movement organizations. To a great degree, differentiation within the movement has already occurred, and some of it can be seen as responding to these gender differences. The organizations most prone to gender differentiation should make special efforts to widen the conceptual framework of their members by explicitly making the other gender's perspective an integral part of their educational program.

        "description":"The recent explosions of computer use and accessibility in both academic and work settings have made computer literacy almost mandatory, yet there are many individuals who are unfamiliar with computers. Previous research has partially attributed computer attitudes to past mathematics experience and gender of the user. This study empirically investigated the relationship between computer familiarity and cognitive ability in an attempt to identify cognitive ability as a variable which may account for differences in computer familiarity and usage. Subjects (N=62), ranging in age from 19 to 40 years of age, completed two cognitive ability tests and reported their familiarity with computers. Results indicated that high scorers on the cognitive ability tests were significantly more  familiar with computers. Contrary to previous research, there were no gender differences in computer familiarity (and cognitive ability). The findings have implications for educational and organizational practices regarding teaching lower cognitive ability persons to use computers. Such programs should include confidence builders, reinforcers, and praise. The programs should move away from independent self-guided to continued instructor guidance programs. (Author/ABL)",

        "description":"It is generally recognized that age, by itself, is not an adequate criterion with which to judge a person's ability to drive. Individuals do not age at the same rate, and there are large intraindividual differences in the aging process. This study, the first phase of a proposed two-phase research project, investigated the relationship of physical fitness to older driver performance by examining descriptively the relative contributions of various measures of cardiorespiratory efficiency, range of motion, and reaction time/movement time to field-based assessments of older driver performance. A total of 106 subjects, ages 20-35 (N=43) and ages 60-75 (N=63) were administered a battery of health, psychomotor, and physical fitness tests and a field-based assessment of automobile  driving skill. In general the results indicated that the physical fitness of older drivers was related to their ability to safety drive an automobile. Older people with higher levels of physical fitness tended to be more proficient at driving than were older people with lower levels of physical fitness. Joint flexibility and reaction time were found to be most predictive of driving ability with cardiorespiratory fitness somewhat less related to driving ability. If a sufficiently strong relationship is established by further research, the older driver may be given a test of physical fitness as part of a driver's licensing examination to determine the levels of his or her driving ability. Plans for phase 2 of the research are briefly outlined, and a list of 83 references is appended.  (ABL)",

        "description":"Good language users monitor and understand their own involvement in the learning process. They understand how language is used to make and reshape their world. Everyone needs to be allowed to test his or her personal theories of the world against practice and vice versa. Given the nature of society, it is important that conceptions of literacy begin with the notion of voice and the importance of hearing everyone's voice. Empowerment begins when each individual is able to name the world as he or she sees it. In naming the world through language, differences are noted and transformative conversations begin. From listening to new voices new anomalies can be identified, new conversations can be started, and potentially new behaviors can be explored. Classrooms organized on a theory  of literacy that values hearing individual voices must be judged by a different set of performance criteria than has traditionally been the case. Strong communities are not formed on the basis of likeminded individuals, but rather on differences, where the different voices making up the community are heard and listened to. It is by hearing different voices that the resources available in a community of learners become known as well as transformed. Classrooms which place a priority on understanding the role that language plays in enhancing learning become communities of learners, as various examples of children's writing illustrate. New criteria for a good theory of language include (1) allowing each person to have a voice; (2) beginning needed conversations; and (3) providing a mechanism  whereby those conversations can continue.

Larry was often disruptive during reading instruction and claimed he could only read when the book was upside down. Tests indicated that Larry had normal vision but that he was learning disabled and reading at only a first grade level. Larry had devised a creative tactic which allowed him to escape the reading circle and at the same time to intrigue and impress the other children. Lessons to be learned from Larry are that: (1) what appeared to be a behavior disorder was only symptomatic of inappropriate instruction; (2) children are poor candidates for learning success when they find themselves dealing daily with survival; (3) placement at a proper  instructional level cannot be over-emphasized; and (4) the decision to retain or not to retain a child should be made only after a complete evaluation has been accomplished.

Each type helps to organize classroom activities, and together they establish the ambiance of the learners' journey. Content plans focus on information students should know. Instructional strategies designed to introduce or elaborate the content presentation should be included. Process plans help students learn how to perform cognitive skills or procedures. Process skills include procedural knowledge that supports independent learning. Context plans set the larger framework in which content and process lessons occur. Context plans can include decisions about grouping, discipline, and grading. The instructor can develop process lesson plans in six steps: (1) decide what process changes would improve  student performance; (2) help students understand the purpose of the lesson; (3) help students connect prior knowledge to new process information; (4) break instruction into incremental steps to help students develop their performance theory; (5) provide meaningful practice in the process; and (6) extend the lesson by making applications to other areas. The process lesson format contributes to the goal of creating more meaningful learning contexts by facilitating instructional planning. Well-structured content and process plans will help insure that all students make progress in acquiring the knowledge and skills that support cultural literacy. (Twenty-two references are attached.)

The categories of primary interest on the value scale used include: positive behavior, positive feelings, negative behavior, negative feelings, traditional values, Judeo-Christian religious values, other religious values, and neutral values. The values scale was applied to two widely used basal reader series, Scott Foresman and Houghton Mifflin, grades one-four and to seven Hispanic basal reader series of variable grade level through grade four presently used in the Chicago area. An examination of the findings revealed noticeable differences between the two American series in the categories of neutral values, positive feelings, positive behavior, and negative feelings. The  stories found in the Hispanic basal readers included values that have religious and traditional moralistic overtones along with very idealistic family values and roles. On the other hand, negative behavior was also presented, such as being drunk, fighting, and treating people cruelly. The Hispanic series examined were very much in accord with Hispanic culture, especially concerning Judeo-Christian religious values and traditional values, so these values are much more prescriptive in the Hispanic series than in the American series. While it seems that the American publishers have gone to a great deal of trouble not to be offensive to any group in a pluralistic society, such is not the case with the Hispanic basal readers.

The survey results reported in the paper indicated that some students were able to complete a cloze-type Mother Goose couplet, but others audibly expressed frustration in recalling the words, expressed total unfamiliarity with the selections, or relied on rhyme to complete the couplet. The paper concludes with 10 suggestions to teachers for preserving the endangered familiarity with Mother Goose and to ensure students' listening and subsequent reading pleasure and understanding.

        "description":"Students at Hauppauge Middle School are writing original children's stories and then telling these stories to preschool children. Before middle school students begin writing their stories, they participate in activities to help them develop a sense of their intended audience. As students write their stories, they work in small groups to discuss their developing stories in the context of activities and focus on story characteristics supporting the structure of text and on story devices reflecting aspects of language. The entire instructional emphasis is on guiding the process rather than on correcting the product. When the stories are completed, volunteers learn storytelling techniques. The creative writing unit and the storytelling activities represent a rewarding bridge from the  middle school to the preschool. Hauppauge High School sponsors a preschool program through its home economics and careers department. Older and younger children benefit from their creative involvement, the teachers also gain useful insights about the importance of language stimulation for young children. Observation of the young children who are active in the program is continuous, and their parents, as well as participating middle school students and teachers, are surveyed. Findings show that most of the preschool children read more books, select a wide variety of materials, maintain a desire to read, and tell their own stories. The middle school students increase their sensitivity for communicating with a unique audience and they report an improved awareness of children's ability to use  and appreciate language.

Subjects, 81 ninth-grade suburban Finnish comprehensive school students in five classrooms, were given the Knowledge Accessing Modes Inventory (KAMI) and the Learning Style Profile (LSP). The relationships between subscales of the instruments and between styles profile and school achievement were analyzed. Results indicated that (1) hardly any subject-related differences could be discovered between the LSP and school achievement; and (2) the Cognitive Style profile subscale of the LSP correlated highly with school achievement, but that only a few  subscales of other sectors of the LSP did the same. Findings suggest that parts of the LSP can be used by teachers to help identify students with learning difficulties and that the LSP can be used in preservice teacher education to familiarize students with the controversy over learning styles.

Subjects, 57 first-grade students in two classrooms attending an elementary school in a middle-class section of Orem, Utah, used the Companion Reading Program, which specifies whole class instruction, during the 1987-1988 academic year. In addition, teachers also used peer tutoring, individual seat work exercises, silent reading, and mastery checking. Classroom observations, interviews, and document analysis constituted the data collection procedures. Results indicated that in the context, setting, and time of the case study, whole class instruction was a viable alternative to ability  grouping.

The newspapers appealed to different constituencies, had contrasting orientations, and enjoyed substantial influence within the Irish-American community. The primary role of the Irish-American press at the beginning of the twentieth century was to make sense out of the tangle of aspirations and insecurities and to devise comprehensible strategies by which respectability and acceptance might be won by the Irish in America. As the world moved inexorably toward World War One, the Irish-American press would scramble for a strategy by which hatred of Britain and all things Anglo-Saxon might somehow be kept  in harmony with loyalty to the United States. Irish immigrants remained in search of a definition of themselves, and the Irish-American press provided that definition in the American context. The Irish-American press provided a critical forum in which the passions, insecurities, and conflicting yearnings of the Irish might be voiced and reconciled. The Irish-American press stood not merely as an ethnic supplement to the mainstream press, but as its adversary. (Ninety-four notes are included.) (RS)",

A means of overcoming these impediments and of ensuring that students will discover and develop the power of their own voice is the Story Workshop approach which creates a firm context for eliciting voice and developing its many extensions. A semicircular arrangement of chairs enhances listening and use of immediate peer audience factors in oral and written exercises, and a sequenced syllabus moves students from more familiar basic forms that call forth naturally their own distinct and most-often-used voices to forms placing an increasing  demand upon more conceptual capabilities. A basic format moves through a series of activities that build sequentially: a recall of vivid images or moments from work read or told in the previous class; oral reading of published models; recall and comment on oral reading, word exercises, oral telling, in-class writing of what was told orally; read-back of the in-class writing; and a final recall. In each activity, the teacher coaches, creates the enabling atmosphere of guided discovery, and thus fosters each student's perceptions about his or her authentic telling and writing voice.

Pagination was chosen as the technology to study because it was the newest in a series of technological innovations that have found their way into newsrooms. The study focused on how pagination technology was introduced, the types of persons who used the technology, and how that is related to job satisfaction. One hundred fifty-nine respondents from 26 newspapers answered a mail survey questionnaire (a 52% response rate) which was designed to examine the concerns of the study. Results  indicated that employee satisfaction was directly related to the degree of involvement the individual had in the planning/implementation stages. Four types of individuals were found to operate in the new tech newsroom: opportunist types, production types, time-conscious types, and Luddites (those who had many problems with the system). Pagination systems have given most newsroom personnel a sense of control over the news process and have changed both the physical layout of the newsroom and the mental preparation of the employees. Those currently working in newsrooms using pagination indicated a number of areas that deserve attention if the new technology is to be implemented to its fullest extent. Findings indicated that a training process should be developed to introduce personnel to the  new technology and to monitor their progress with it. The implementation of new technology in the newsroom has expanded horizons, responsibilities, and the need to understand its long-term effects.

For a generation, the glamour of writing for the &quot;World&quot; attracted young journalists who aspired to edit or write for a daily. Beyond that, the &quot;World&quot; was the powerhouse of its own syndicate of 50 black-owned semi-weeklies and weeklies west to Iowa and north to Ohio. Legendary among the journalists whose careers in the black press started at the &quot;World&quot; was Frank Marshall Davis, later esteemed as a poet of black protest. As managing editor of the &quot;World,&quot; he helped establish and maintain the daily edition, which began in March 1932. From 1931-34, Marshall made the gatekeeper decisions concerning news coverage and articulated the &quot;World's&quot; editorial voice, expressing what he called social  realism on behalf of social, political and economic justice for blacks.

        "description":"A study was conducted to find out how the topics of the Nineteenth Amendment and women's suffrage were handled at the time by news publications in rural areas. Several components were used to carry out the objective: one was to investigate newspaper coverage of the amendment and in addition broaden that search to include women's suffrage; another was to focus on newspapers in one rural community as a case study and to compare this coverage with that of other communities. Each edition of Marengo, Iowa's weekly newspapers during 1918, 1919 and 1920 was studied for any hint of information about the Nineteenth Amendment or women's suffrage. During those 3 years, nine announcements/stories and three visuals (without accompanying stories) were published in Marengo's different  newspapers. In addition to the newspaper case study, an oral account was also obtained by interviewing a Marengo resident who was of voting age in 1920. Through her account of the time and issue, &quot;it would seem&quot; that Marengo residents were not informed about amendment debates and progress nor were they given interpretations of how suffrage could affect them personally. By studying the newspapers of three other towns ranging in size from rural to urban, a check was made to see what information nearby Iowa residents were receiving. Results suggest that Marengo's lack of information was not typical for that time period or geographic area, but perhaps was typical for a rural newspaper.

The introductory activity in the model is a discussion of a student opinionnaire which uses opinions to create interest in a work of literature and helps with problems students will encounter in trying to interpret character. Next is small group work and ensuing class discussion based on a character questionnaire which gives students practice in making inferences about a character, gathering and selecting evidence, and explaining how evidence supports a conclusion about a major character. This is followed by an  activity sheet in which students must consider and weigh many possibilities as they rank an extensive list of values and argue their positions to reach a consensus with respect to a particular character's values in a group discussion. The follow-up assignment asks students to do in writing exactly what they have done orally in discussing the character. Appendixes include student activity sheets, opinionnaires and questionnaires, and a sample student essay. (KEH)",

Sixteen college students wrote a short essay in a single session on either a word processor or in longhand. The quality of the essays was assessed by trained judges who rated their content and style. Text analysis methods were also employed to corroborate the subjective ratings. Writing fluency was measured in terms of words produced per minute of composing time. Changes in the organization of cognitive processing were studied by measuring the degree of cognitive effort and processing time associated with specific writing processes. Findings suggested that word processing restructured writing processes, but failed to amplify writing performance. Most  importantly, results indicated that the pattern of allocating cognitive effort to writing processes interacted with the type of writing tool. Whereas effort was distributed about equally to planning, translating, and reviewing when writing longhand, a different pattern was seen on the word processor. Planning and reviewing consumed the most effort, and translating the least. Processing time, in contrast to cognitive effort, failed to show any interaction between writing tool and process.

        "description":"Researchers in the field of emergent literacy have been watching young children and find that they have a natural interest in print. Many researchers have documented stages of writing and spelling and have illustrated that children can learn to read and write as naturally as they can learn to speak, given an appropriate print environment. Writing precedes reading, and these acts complement each other. In a writing process classroom, the children should have a writing time each day, beginning with the first day, and should be allowed to choose their own writing topics. Anything they produce should be accepted as writing, including drawing, scribbling, copied print, and invented spelling. Types of conferences used to benefit the writing process of each student include conferences  on content, focusing, expanding, process, evaluation, and editing. Very often writing process classrooms become reading/writing classrooms. One strategy used in these classrooms is the &quot;shared book experience&quot; involving four steps: (1) warm-up, (2) rereading of favorite stories, (3) new story, and (4) expressive activities. Another strategy that brings reading and writing together for young children is the language experience approach. This involves the children dictating an account of an experience while the teacher writes what the child said using their language, with correct spelling. Journals are another popular way to bring reading and writing together. Educators need to provide children with real reasons and opportunities for reading and writing. (MG)",

        "description":"Arguing that educational research rarely makes it into print, this paper discusses what is wrong with educational research, what is wrong with the press, and offers suggestions for improving the relationship between educational research and the press. The paper argues that (1) education research is badly underfunded; (2) the most pressing questions in education research are often ignored; (3) most of the research comes in bits and pieces; (4) much education research is written in dense, abstract prose; and (5) education research often confirms common sense, which does not make for much of a news story. The paper argues that since most education research fails to pass the test of being new and significant, reporters and editors usually ignore it. The paper also notes that  education is considered a backwater beat. The paper concludes that the relationship between education research and the press could be improved if there were a few well-edited research journals with a broad audience, a dozen media stars who could serve as sources for the press, and a regular schedule of research reports from organizations such as the Department of Education and the National Assessment of Educational Progress.

Each teacher taught two ninth grade English classes, one according to traditional methods and one with the experimental condition in which students taught each other by commenting on each other's essays in writing. All students wrote discursive essays making use of printed documentation. Five hundred sixty-one students participated in the main attitude survey; 792 essays were written. Results revealed that the difference between peer feedback and teacher feedback produced no differences on writing performance and psychological variables. Also, sex and proficiency level showed little or no effect in relation  to type of feedback.

        "description":"I. A. Richards (most easily recognized as the &quot;father&quot; of New Criticism, but a true interdisciplinarian) bears re-examination in light of present discussions over the role and nature of rhetoric as a discipline. Richards' work has more to offer than is presently recognized. First, his work in toto exemplifies the capability and possible role of rhetoricians to reflect and unify the diversity of disciplines in the modern university. Second, his various investigations and speculations in the different disciplines are, for the most part, still unrecognized and unused. His concerns about what rhetoric is and how it is to be used have neither been resolved nor shelved. &quot;The Philosophy of Rhetoric&quot; is a good example of a work which represents the essential characteristics of Richards'  thoughts on language and its uses. This paper studies the aims of discourse and types of context, the interinanimation of words, some criteria of words, metaphor, and the command of metaphor.

        "author":["Williams, David Cratis"],
        "description":"This essay analyzes Kenneth Burke's speech (&quot;Revolutionary Symbolism&quot;) to the 1935 Writers Congress, a congress intended to explore the relationship between politics and art, and controlled closely by the American Communist Party. The essay maintains that Burke was prepared to offer to the Communist Party and to all &quot;left-leaning&quot; writers a propaganda strategy, based on what he saw as the potential for cultural transvaluations through politically astute manipulations of artistic form. The essay analyzes Burke's propaganda strategy as an extension--and transformation--of the concept of &quot;form.&quot; It also uses the concept as the basis for constructing an account of Burke's reception by the Congress, and ultimately suggests that Burke's speech signals a reconceptualization by Burke of  the art of &quot;rhetoric&quot; itself, moving from a primary conceptualization of rhetoric as technique to a primary conceptualization of rhetoric as propaganda (which is itself preliminary to the move toward rhetoric as identification). The paper is in three sections: (1) a historical description of the purposes and nature of the Congress; (2) an exposition of Burke's strategy for revolutionary propaganda; and (3) an assessment of Burke's own strategy in speaking before the Congress and his reception by them in relation to the concepts of &quot;form&quot; and &quot;rhetoric.&quot; Twenty-two references are attached.

The paper concludes that music video is the aesthetic of the alienated establishment, removing the musician one step further from direct contact with an audience.

        "description":"Public relations instructors can begin to develop an appreciation of the social, political and economic (S-P-E) contexts on the part of their students by beginning to integrate this thinking into existing courses and curricula. Social contexts deal with cultural and subcultural beliefs, contacts within a community or organization, and frames of reference and standards of comparisons. Political contexts include activities and strategies of political actors and role and power relationships. Economic contexts include availability of resources to client organizations and publics and coping with and cutting costs. During the term students can be expected to do several things that help enhance sensitivity to the S-P-E contexts: (1) draw on a range of S-P-E social science and humanities  concepts while critically and comprehensively defining public relations goals; (2) read several case reports and define the three overlapping contexts; (3) confront ethical situations that cannot be examined apart from the social-political contexts; (4) prepare a paper which looks at an actual client's role, public relations problems, key publics, and services to those publics; and (5) hold a series of panel discussions on timely cases. Following these and other exercises, most students seem to see public relations as a dynamic, exciting process central to the client organization's basic function, a process that entails far more than promotion and publicity when placed in a larger context. Selected findings from three public relations research projects illustrate the use of the S-P-E  concepts. (Twenty-six references are attached.) (MG)",

The subjects were a purposive sample of 92 people in the field (consisting of 77 educators out of 150 surveyed and 15 graduate students out of 20 surveyed) representing scholars who had conducted feminist research and scholars who had not, educators and students, and males and females. Data were collected via a fractionation scale questionnaire, and some follow-up telephone interviews. The questionnaire explored attitudes about: (1) whether 17 listed issues should  be an important aspect of the body of knowledge in journalism and mass communication, and whether these issues have actually achieved such prominence; (2) involvement with feminist research; (3) whether men can be feminist scholars; (4) whether attitudes toward feminist research have changed; and (5) the extent to which respondents believed having a feminist research agenda affects promotion and tenure decision. Data was also collected on demographic variables. Major findings showed some support among the sample of educators for the conventional wisdom that women are advised against doing feminist research, while indicating that women also have been encouraged to do feminist work; they also showed that among the sample of graduate students, advice about feminist scholarship was  exclusively in the form of encouragement.

A research review supports the contention that the power struggle between men and women as defined by the pornography issue merely reflects a deeper, generally-accepted gender inequality which tends to leave women out of the shaping of corporate and legal policies. The use of consumer boycott by a group of feminists in the late 1970s is discussed in depth in order to provide support for the conclusion that feminists can define a more active role for themselves in determining corporate media policy regarding the portrayal of women.

Questionnaires analyzing every story on the premier evening newscast were distributed on four of the days. Propositions relating to the cost of discovery, the cost of assembling stories, and audience appeal were tested for both models of news selection.

A mailed questionnaire received 142 joint spouse responses in a small midwestern city. Results indicated that knowing one spouse's media characteristics and demographics substantially improves the ability to predict the characteristics of the other spouse. The study also developed three possible models of spousal influence that would affect newspaper readership patterns: (1) the traditional role model, in which spouses have little effect on each other's reading habits, each continuing to read what they learned to read earlier; (2) the substitution model, where tasks  are divided, with one spouse reading certain areas and reporting to the other; and (3) the sharing model, in which mutual interests developed as a result of the marital relationship cause both spouses to read certain portions of the newspaper. Models two and three suggest that the marriage relationship can play a role in shaping newspaper readership patterns. Results also showed that newspaper reliance patterns of spouses change as they age, with husbands relying more on newspapers under age 45, and wives relying more on them above that age.

Data was reanalyzed from a content analysis of 114 newspapers (including 72 monopoly, 21 competitive, and 21 joint-operating-agreement newspapers) from a constructed week in November 1984. Findings showed statistically significant support for the relationship between financial commitment and quality, though not as strong as expected. Support for the relationship between news quality and circulation was strong, with quality accounting for a  fairly large proportion of variance in circulation. These results suggest that competition makes better newspapers through financial commitment and that better newspapers sell more copies as a general rule.

The study further extends attribution theory to social interaction and communication contexts. A sample survey of 355 adults (age 18 and over) in the Milwaukee metropolitan area was conducted by telephone in April 1988. A content analysis found some mass media and interpersonal communication relationships with internal and external attributions for Vietnam veterans' problems. Attributions for the cause of a problem do seem related to preferred solutions. It appears that interpersonal communication could be affecting  attributions. Mass communication may also be affecting attributional schemata under certain circumstances. Results indicated the impact of experience on media relationships with attributions was more complex than anticipated. There may still be enough uncertainty about how to deal with the memory of the Vietnam War, and with its veterans, that even the more experienced might still be seeking attributions.

        "description":"There are several areas within radio for a college intern. An internship in sales becomes highly useful in exposing the student to the financial end of the business since many college broadcasting programs emphasize production, journalism, and law. Although there are many students who enjoy working in production, many of the smaller stations do too little production to warrant an intern assigned specifically to this area, and many interns become engrossed with the fancy equipment. A college intern can be useful to a radio station's music director, although most music directors agree that a full-time intern slot would be difficult to fill in music alone. The motivated student can learn a lot more in the local radio news internship than in any college broadcast journalism course.  Some of the problems which arise with college interns involve long-range career goals, attitude problems, and reliability. Unrealistic expectations on the part of both the intern and the broadcaster can also create problems. Some items to keep in mind when considering a college student for an internship include the following: treat the prospective intern as a regular candidate for employment; conduct a traditional interview; feel free to subject the student to some sort of practical test; and do not hesitate to reject applicants or fire one you have already hired. All parties involved--station manager, intern, and professor--must be willing to communicate their desires and fears in a legitimate effort to keep expectations high and yet realistic. (MG)",

Data were gathered from surveys, and from lab and field experiments on 1,323 subjects. Findings indicated five risk-taking factors: adventurousness, rebelliousness, impulsiveness, physical risk taking, and unconventional risk taking. These factors vary systematically with risky behavior, cognitive and affective involvement, health locus of control, conviction, need for cognition, media use, source confidence, and demographics. The risk-taking indices are positively correlated with both smoking behavior and speeding. Positive feelings about health are positively associated with adventurous and physical risk taking and negatively associated with impulsive  risk taking. Adventurous and physical risk taking are also positively correlated with conviction. Need for cognition is positively related to adventurousness and negatively related to impulsiveness. Generally, use of media for health information is unrelated or negatively related to risk taking, but radio exposure tends to be high for risk takers.

Participants in the study included 12 third-year law school students, 1 adjunct instructor, 1 researcher, 12 local high school students, and 6 senior citizens, all of whom volunteered to participate as members of an unfamiliar witness and jury pool. Data collection included participant observation, informal interviews, field notes, a formal questionnaire, and a researcher's reflexive journal. All data was subjected to qualitative analytic methodology including coding and triangulation of data. Findings indicated that using unfamiliar people during trial simulations  required students to demonstrate considerable emotional, psychological, and intellectual stamina. Specifically, it required them to &quot;decenter,&quot; to function as storytellers, and to &quot;read the jury&quot; throughout a trial.

        "description":"The dramatic art of mime can be viewed through a theory of multiple intelligences. Mime is a mode of the bodily-kinesthetic intelligence which is characterized as the ability to integrate body movement and to use the body in highly differentiated and skilled ways, for expression as well as directed goals. Mime is the language of the body, the silent component of an otherwise spoken language--strong enough with its own symbolic system so that words are not needed. Mime is a silent song, the controlled movement of silence in time, at times staccato, at times flowing, anchored by rhythm. The mathematics of mime primarily deals with long chains of logical reasoning which must be integrated by the mime in the moment of the performance. Mime creates space by making visible the  invisible, by learning to use the empty space of the stage area to create and sustain visual and spatial forms. Mime is intrapersonal in the respect that it is about humanity, about fate. It is a freely given gift created expressly for the people in the audience. By implication, it is eminently worthwhile to investigate the practical applications of mime in the field of education. The bodily-kinesthetic energy within each student may prove to be one of the vast untapped resources available to educators everywhere. (MG)",

        "description":"Televised continuing education provides an opportunity for educational institutions to expand their borders, to gain new students and to meet the needs of prospective students unable to conform to the time and space demands of traditional education. As American society ages, increasing numbers of non-residential (non-campus) students are seeking access to formal instruction. To be effective, televised instruction must maintain the high standards of traditional academia and should be evaluated based on the needs of learners and the resources of the originating institution. Successful video instruction, regardless of the specific medium, should be developed utilizing systematic instructional design methods and should be the result of a \"team effort\" by both education and production  specialists. When effectively created, developed, and delivered, televised education provides an excellent tool for reaching and attracting adult learners as individuals, groups with similar interests, and as members of professions.

At one level, that of the &quot;coming-out&quot; story of the main character, it presents the gay character in a positive light, and sets him up for a positive reception through a number of narrative and gender-related codes. In contrast, through its use of production related codes, it presents his relationship as incomplete, and his sexuality as a prison, with the final moral message being that the price of virtue is solitude. These same production codes present persons with AIDS as being stigmatized aliens who cannot be approached closer than at  arm's length, while at the same time arguing through the narrative for sympathy and understanding for persons with AIDS.

Subjects, undergraduate students at the University of Windsor in Windsor, Ontario, and individuals recruited from several educational institutions within the Kansas City, Missouri, greater metropolitan area, viewed five videotaped scenes (three from American television series and two from films) lasting about two minutes each. Subjects then filled out a semantic differential scale composed of word-pairs used to describe the protagonist in each scene. Overall scale results and the majority of thought listings  showed all subject groups to be similar in their evaluation of and probable level of identification with the first three violent media models. However, results from the first three scenes were unreliable because of the lack of model saliency and susceptibility to script constructs. Results from the fourth scene's protagonists were too unsympathetic to be identified with. Results from the fifth scene (from the Canadian film &quot;The Grey Fox&quot; indicated that Canadian males approved of the Mounted Police more strongly on a majority of word variables than American males, American females, and Canadian females. Results also indicated that the protagonists were judged more realistic by all the subjects. (Five charts of data, five tables of data, and 66 notes are included.) (RS)",

The paper identifies seven distinctive patterns of health attitudes, social influences, and behaviors using cluster analytic techniques in a sample drawn from four California cities (N=2,504). The paper finds that these lifestyle clusters predict associated behaviors, including seatbelt use, vitamin use, and attention to health information, with higher means for health-oriented clusters in each case. Furthermore, the paper finds that the clusters predict self-reported improvements in health behavior--e.g., eating less salt and losing weight--and self-reported new exercise as  measured in a two-year follow-up, with higher means again found, with two exceptions, for health-related clusters. Implications for public health education and intervention efforts, and future research directions are discussed. Four tables of data and eight notes are included, and 17 references are attached.

There are four general categories into which to divide variables concerning processing strategies for mediated social information: source characteristics, message characteristics, social inference heuristics, and cognitive style. Three types of circumstances may be distinguished which influence how people account for mediation: a message recipient's goals in processing the message; the domain of social information conveyed in the message; and the relationship between prior social information and that conveyed by a message. The dialectic between theories of mind and theories of social  impact is not simple or straightforward. Elucidation of how messages of various kinds are processed should lead to much more focused examination of the conditions and circumstances under which ambitious theories of media effect are likely or unlikely to hold.

The 24 paid subjects each received one of four sets of prose excerpts. Each set consisted of four excerpts that were labelled as fiction or nonfiction and were manipulated to refer to either a familiar or unfamiliar social group. Interactions between group familiarity and fiction/non-fiction status on beliefs about group member attributes and on confidence in belief estimates were found. It is concluded that fictional messages about unfamiliar groups of people may well have equal or greater impact on readers' beliefs than do nonfictional messages. The results of the study also  highlight the contexts in which cultivation and dependency theory are more applicable. (One table and two figures are included, and 41 references are attached.) (MG)",

It argues that current feminist epistemological studies of women's ways of knowing, making sense, and solving problems can and should inform attempts to empower democratic dialogues and restructure the public sphere. The paper makes this argument by examining some feminist deconstructions of the gendered silences cultivated by androcentric theories of political discourse and participatory democracy; exploring the promises of feminist reconstructions of models of rationality, communication, and community--&quot;motherwit&quot;--as well as some of the limitations of these models as vehicles for recreating participatory democracy; reviewing what  we know about gendered differences in strategies and structures for organizing social action; and speculating on how feminist materialism can contribute to emancipatory attempts to recreate dialogue and democracy. The paper is in seven sections: (1) Introduction: Social Capital and Socially Structured Silences; (2) Gendered Silences; (3) Reconstructing the Public Sphere: The Limitations of Motherwit; (4) Beyond the Kitchen Sink: How Women Conceive and Organize Social Action; (5) Gendered Organizational Discourse; (6) Women's Organizational Strategies; and (7) Implications: Breaking the Silences in Theories of Democratic Discourse.

Hundreds of youth from five American cities--Newark, Boston, Kansas City, Dallas, and Oakland--were interviewed. Informal and tape-recorded discussions were conducted with groups of students as well as teachers and administrators who were chosen spontaneously. Out of thousands of pages of transcripts, 23 voices were selected to speak for the rest.

The point of view of the book is that the crisis in the schools is a societal rather than simply an educational issue. Children must resist incredible outside pressures just to remain in school. The sensitive attitudes of students, teachers, and administrators across the country reflected in this book reveal the problem far more humanly than the statistics can suggest. (SI)",

International trade is growing at twice the rate of domestic trade, competition across national borders is intense, and telecommunication networks encircle the globe. Knowledge is beginning to be harnessed by the computer, accelerating the historical tendency of nations to move toward democratic governance. A more sophisticated political economy is developing, where democracy and enterprise have extended into new economic areas and are uniting to form an unusual synthesis of cooperation and competition. Differences in capitalism and socialism result largely from cultural  preferences rather than the superiority of either system. Many nations are committed to socialism because of the flaws they see in capitalism, and, conversely, capitalism is attractive to many others due to the problems in socialism. The key solution focuses on redefining enterprise to incorporate social controls at its grassroots. The resulting economy would serve the public welfare while simultaneously permitting entrepreneurial freedom. Because this concept unifies both ends of the political spectrum, it could prove to be a powerful combination of both economic and social values. (11 references) (KM)",

The analysis was drawn from a survey of 27 superintendents who had resigned from their current positions. Respondents (N=24) indicated a moderate to high degree of pressure from school boards. All respondents, except one, did not identify implementing the Education Improvement Act as having a strong influence on their decisions to resign. The retirement incentive had little influence on resignation decisions. There appeared to be some relationship between number of years in the superintendency, age of the respondent, and moving to a position with more attractive benefits. Those with 11-14 years of superintendency experience indicated they were moving to a position  with more attractive benefits. (3 references) (SI)",

Specific detail is given for the instructional management component of CMS because of its potential for managing curriculum and instruction. The South Carolina Education Improvement Act requires school personnel to document that standards are met and that remediation is successfully provided in cases where standards are not met. The discussion is not limited to the use of CMS in remedial or compensatory settings, however. Hardware, software, and training programs are discussed with respect to their impact on the classroom teacher and the services provided  by that teacher. Essentially, CMS is a pilot program used to develop teacher-level management tools that will computerize and automate the assessment and diagnosis of student needs, the selection and application of instructional prescriptions, and the recording and reporting of the results of those processes and procedures.

In the first part, school effects research is drawn upon in order to elaborate upon a model developed by John Carroll (1963) at Teachers College. In the second part, the focus is on one set of relationships within Carroll's model in an attempt to broaden understanding of how social contexts influence the operation of instructionally effective schools. Research suggests that schools can become effective without parent involvement, yet parent involvement and expectations seem to have  potentially powerful effects on student learning. It also raises the following question for future investigation: What combinations of effectiveness factors appear to enhance instructional effectiveness given varying social contexts? It is recommended that future studies examine both the source of expectations and the manner in which schools translate and communicate expectations to students. In particular, researchers should examine the principal's role in linking the school and the community. Contingency theories of organizational leadership may provide guidance in comceptualizing the dynamics between organizational context and effective instructional leadership behavior. (JAM)",

In chapter 1, the legal basis for entry year programs is examined through a statement of the Ohio Department of Education Standard in which these learning experiences are mandated. The research bases for the development of induction programs for beginning administrators are presented in chapter 2. A discussion of the development of programmatic wholeness and integrity is covered in chapter 3 for the purpose of indicating how entry-year programs might be able to fit other school district inservice and professional  development activities. Chapter 4 reviews a model for developing an entry year program and offers an outline to assist planners of entry year programs with design, adoption, and eventual evaluation of a written entry year support plan. Chapter 5 considers curricular relevancy issues directly related to design and implementation of plans for the induction of administrators, with particular attention to mentoring arrangements. Chapters 6, 7, and 8 describe the mentoring and protege components of entry-year programs. Chapter 8 specifically focuses on curricular issues associated with the development of mentor training programs that might be established throughout the state of Ohio. Assisting planners with assessment procedures for their entry-year programs is discussed in chapter 9.  Particular attention is placed on the use of the Ohio Department of Education model for the evaluation of its own inservice programs. (JAM)",

School system size was a more important determinant of screening procedures than applicable state legislation or other factors, with smaller systems relying more on employment and character references than on criminal record checks. Direct  questioning of references about the applicant's criminal history, sexual deviance, or other problems is seldom used. Criminal record checks are often conducted without fingerprints. Some types of applicants may not be screened at all. Evidence of problem areas is presented, along with implications for policy and for further research. (Author/SI)",

The case studies presented in this monograph attempt to restore the teacher's perspective. Rather than analyzing policy shortfalls stemming from teacher \"apathy\" or \"incompetence,\" the booklet studies three successful high school English teachers committed to their profession and to visions of \"best practice\" within diverse classroom contexts. A qualitative approach based on interviews, classroom observations, and examination of written documents was employed to construct the case studies. Each case study contains a description of the teacher's school day and interpretive sections examining work  demands and teaching strategies. All three teachers worked at suburban, comprehensive high schools with enrollments of about 1,500. Confronted with persistent demands of curriculum management, large classes, and time constraints, all teachers studied developed conservation and isolationist strategies to ensure their daily survival. Teachers' work environments resemble other \"street level bureaucracies\" (like police stations and welfare offices) characterized: by (1) inadequate resources; (2) ambiguous goals; (3) unclear performance evaluation criteria; and (4) nonvoluntary clients. Fortunately, the teachers did not process their students as they did their curricula, but negotiated cooperative alliances with students and bent rules in their interest. Policymakers need to follow these  teachers' example and seek alliances with teachers, develop supportive staff development programs, relinquish tight control over classroom methods, and revamp their stereotyped images of teachers.

Following the assumption that the recognized schools collectively represent some of America's better elementary and secondary institutions, the administrative skills of the recognized schools' principals were studied and contrasted to the administrative skills of randomly selected school principals. During the 1987-88 school year, packets containing Audit of Principal Effectiveness surveys were mailed to 483 of the 1986-87 recognized school principals for distribution among 10 of their teachers; and 375 identical packets were mailed to randomly  selected schools (from seven different geographic regions) for distribution. For inclusion in the study, at least five of the school's teachers had to return completed surveys; the response rate was 36 percent from recognized schools, and 35 percent from the random sample. Results indicate that clearly, the teachers of the recognized schools perceive their principals as more effective than teachers of the random schools. The pattern of differences between the perceptions of the teachers surveyed in this study supports the belief that more effective schools are administered by more effective principals.

Initially, 162 items forming 12 theoretical factors describing effective principal behavior were identified and sorted into two documents. The documents, each containing 81 items, were mailed to a total of 3,660 teachers (equally distributed among seven United States geographic regions) for evaluation regarding the degree to which each item was descriptive of an effective administrator skill. Based on responses, the documents were shortened to contain 55 items each; this format was used between 1985 and 1986. Although accurately descriptive of necessary effective principal skills, the completion of two documents proved too time consuming and  cumbersome. Another random sample of teachers (3,300) was mailed documents for evaluation. The resulting second refinement yielded one form divided into three principal areas of skill, with nine associated factors, and 80 items. This instrument, currently in use, includes the domains of: (1) organizational development containing the factors of organizational direction, linkage, and procedures; (2) organizational environment containing the factors of teacher and student relations, and interactive and affective processes; and (3) the educational program containing the factors of instructional and curricular improvement.

The first steps in school crime prevention management are to acknowledge the problem's existence and to report a crime when it occurs. This document, written by a criminologist, contains five sections that address personal crisis management and employee safety when confronted with school crime and violence. Specifically, the sections discuss school security, robbery survival, rape survival, hostage-taking survival, and crime deterrence and prevention. Many measures, both administratively and individually, can be taken to make schools safer for learning and to prevent, deter, or reduce school violence. Included among these measures are: (1) instruction for teachers in  dangerous settings on target-hardening methods not only for their own safety, but for the youths who need to be stopped and confronted with their criminality; (2) the designation of safe working locations for teachers within the school building; and (3) the understanding among all staff members that personal security is one's own responsibility and cannot be delegated to others. Crime avoidance techniques are literally a lifestyle commitment; they are easily adapted to one's daily routine. (101 references) (KM)",

Twenty-five respondents from 11 nations commented on a questionnaire about how their governmental agency encourages cooperative efforts. Responses from Canada and the United States are highlighted along with a review of selected literature on educational cooperation and organization in these two neighboring nations. Findings indicate that the departments of  education in Canada and in the United States engender cooperation among precollegiate schools through financial support, systemwide standardization of curriculum, and cosponsorship of community programs. Encouragement of school-university cooperation usually proceeds through indirect channels or through short-term, specially funded projects. (10 references) (SI)",

        "description":"To construct a descriptive analysis of national school system size categories suitable to facilitate cross-provincial comparisons in future research, data concerning the number of students, schools, teachers, and school and central office administrators as reported in 1986-87, excluding Quebec, were obtained from Statistics Canada. Enrollment and school data for Quebec were supplied for the 1987-88 school year by the Quebec Ministry of Education. To qualify as a school system, a board had either to operate more than one school, or to employ a board administrator; the final data contained 788 public school systems within Canada's 10 provinces and 2 territories. In addition to enrollment, school numbers, mean school enrollment, and three estimates of employee numbers were used as  organizational size measures. An analysis of compiled data indicated high correlations between employee measures and enrollment, suggesting that while enrollment may represent a different theoretical measure of size, it can nonetheless be used as a reasonable proxy for employee number (although differences of scale remain). Further research involving school system size measures should be sensitive to the presence of exceptionally large or small systems during sampling and analysis. Five tables and four figures are included. (57 references and 5 footnotes) (KM)",

In addition, a continuum of leitmotives on educational partnerships drawn from historic and current writings is reviewed for their influences on contemporary practices. From these research bases, a predictive model for trends or cycles in educational partnerships is offered with a focus on how government will support such collaborations in the 1990s. The conclusion--that state governments should initiate projects that bring faculty from the primary, secondary, undergraduate, and graduate segments of American education to plan  educational improvement strategies together--underscores the point that any restructuring of American schooling requires cooperative involvement among all its external and internal constituencies.

Given the complex challenges facing schools, colleges, and policymakers, ECS focused on three priorities. First, it is necessary to restructure schools, colleges and education systems to ensure higher levels of achievement and higher outcomes for all students. Students should learn not only important skills and information but also how to use the knowledge. Second, it is necessary to attend to the needs of youth at risk of failing school and failing to become productive citizens. Third, minorities need to be brought into full participation in the educational and professional life of the nation. As  leaders, ECS will promote several new strategies to aid in accomplishing these tasks: (1) sponsoring debate; (2) providing information to leaders; (3) conducting issue management; and (4) providing strategic assistance partnerships.

        "description":"In response to criticism aimed at the quality and effectiveness of American schools, especially in the areas of mathematics and science where American students were found to take considerably fewer courses than their foreign counterparts, most states raised course work requirements for high school graduation. To examine the effects of the state policy changes and the relationship between course-taking and student characteristics, data collected on eleventh grade students by the 1983-84 National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) were analyzed. Results indicate that course-taking varies by racial/ethnic group and by level of parental education. White and nonlanguage minority Asian students whose parents had some postsecondary education are more likely to take  college-preparatory mathematics and advanced science courses than are students of other racial/ethnic groups or students from families with less formal education. Data from the 1985-86 NAEP and from questionnaires completed by students who took the College Board Scholastic Aptitude Test show that, between 1982 and 1984, significant increases occurred in the percentage of students taking all levels of college preparatory mathematics and science courses; few changes were noted in mathematics and science course-taking, with the exception of biology, between 1984 and 1986.

To ascertain the degree and type of change experienced, curriculum information on class section quantities and enrollments was collected from 16 secondary schools and compiled for the periods 1982-83 and 1986-87. Large increases were observed in offerings and enrollments in science, foreign languages, computer education, and health, while large declines occurred in vocational and physical education, and study hall. With the exception of observed curricular stability in mathematics, social studies, and language arts, these departmental trends mirror trends  (observed nationally) of a shift toward a more academically oriented high school curriculum. A number of differences were noted between schools, determined by the percent of students receiving free or reduced lunches, classified as high socioeconomic (SES) and low SES. Enrollments in mathematics and safety and driver education increased in high-SES schools while declining in low-SES schools; foreign language enrollment showed greater increase in low-SES schools due to lower enrollment levels in 1982-83. Greater variation in curricular change by school SES was exhibited within departments. (11 references) (KM)",

This document examines the findings about curriculum policy in the school context. A total of 188 interviews were conducted at the state level in six states and 524 interviews in 59 local schools within those states. This paper concentrates on curriculum policy in high schools. The paper discusses three perspectives of curriculum policy in the school context: (1) the school as mediator of policy outcomes; (2) the school as policy critic; and (3) the school as policy constructor. Next, a methodological discussion of curriculum policy analysis is presented, followed by  reasons why the perspectives of policy and school context are likely to be different. The lessons learned from the school as policy mediator, policy critic, and policy constructor all point in a similar direction: schools and teachers must be actively engaged in the exercise of constructing a high quality curriculum for their students; some types of curriculum policy have the potential for increasing stratification and thus lowering the overall quality of instruction; and schools and teachers have their own perspectives on curriculum policy.

The Soviet political leaders of the 1980s, in an effort to improve their educational system, are implementing into the academic program the basic Soviet educational principles of: (1) promoting Communist Party policies; (2) coordinating school work with youth, community, and political organizations, and with industrial and agricultural enterprises; (3) combining polytechnical labor education, aesthetic education, and general education with moral education; (4) equating moral education with the Lenin communist ethical system; and (5) uniting academic and ethical knowledge with socially useful applications. School structure changes are included in the reform effort. First, children  will complete 11 years of general education beginning at age 6. Second, vocational schools will be consolidated into one institution. And third, all students must acquire a skill proficiency in some common occupation. To accomplish these goals, a large number of talented people must be encouraged to enter the teaching profession, classrooms must be provided with technological equipment, and substantial funds must be provided. Examining the Soviet efforts at educational reform will provide valuable insights about imaginative educational methods and means in another society whose ends are so very different.

The essential reform necessary today is the evolution of schools into places that stimulate learning: places where the mind is not just a catalogue and where individuals can thoughtfully find and make meaning. The relevant school principal role is one of developing the thoughtful mind. Innovative programs to prepare principals for this role include internships under mentor principal guidance and genuine cooperation between universities and school districts. One such program, the  Leaders Preparation Program (LPP) implemented in 1986, began as a collaborative arrangement between five Utah shool districts and the College of Education at Brigham Young University; today, 16 Utah school districts participate, and program graduates are highly sought as administrative applicants throughout the state. Current observations of four LPP interns and four Utah Valley mentor principals, conducted by three university department members and three graduate students, raise questions that indicate promise of improvement for administrator preparation programs.

Lastly, the value of these physical models to those who wish to participate in making justifiable decisions about the changes toward improving the quality of learning in schools is outlined.

Responses, received from 119 of the students, were combined with academic advisor and internship coordinator interviews, student academic record reviews, and program evaluations to develop a profile of the typical intern. For comparison of current interns to past graduates, questionnaires were mailed to 1,100 former DELA students, 620 of whom responded; of these responses, graduates of the years 1980, 1983, and 1984 were  selected for comparison. The demographic pattern of DELA interns that emerged mirrored the general characteristics of the 1986 Long Island public school teachers. The results indicate that the typical intern has more than 15 years' public school teaching experience, is female, has served in secondary schools, holds a master's and/or a higher degree, and has changed position in the last 5 years. Intern responses regarding field perceptions were generally positive; however, the specific field experience areas of time commitment, placement, and role definition raised questions for further study.

To determine the degree of implementation and the superintendent's perceptions about the effectiveness of PBPE, one half of the state's approximately 550 superintendents were mailed surveys; usable responses were received from 168 districts.

Principals' attitudes regarding PBPE were described as positive; their attitudes were more positive in the districts where principals were involved in developing the PBPE system, in the districts that followed the state model procedures, and in the districts where the evaluators had more training and were perceived as more skilled. The superintendent and other educational leaders from across the state who responded to the PBPE survey indicated that PBPE can impact positively on Missouri education. (KM)",

In the winter and spring of 1989, 400 questionnaires were mailed to a random national sample of school superintendents to examine the following areas dealing with negotiations between education boards and teacher organizations: (1) the board's negotiating team composition; (2) the school superintendent's role; (3) the advantages and disadvantages of board member participation in negotiations and the resulting situations; and (4) the relationship between these factors, school district size, and whether teachers have gone on strike. A total of 246 questionnaires were returned representing 46 states. The results,  some of which were compared with a 1970 study that asked a few of the same questions, indicate that school district size was significant in whether board members should be on the bargaining team; the superintendent's number of years of experience was important in determining whether he or she was on the negotiating team and whether the teacher association tried to cause conflict between the negotiator and the board; and a relationship existed between strikes and whether the teachers tried to bypass the board's negotiating team.

To determine the views of school administrators and teachers concerning AIDS and the related issues that affect the operation and management of public schools and to provide a basis for organizational planning, staff develop activities, and community related programs, questionnaires were mailed to 100 building level administrators and 100 teachers employed in rural mid-Tennessee public schools. The results indicate that both administrators and teachers: (1) felt  uncomfortable with their current level of AIDS knowledge; (2) thought that students and personnel would be at risk with AIDS-infected persons in schools; and (3) objected to AIDS-diagnosed personnel or students attending school. Accurate, research-based, and medically documented information is recommended to help dispel myths and to resolve the misunderstandings about AIDS.

To exemplify ongoing research and development in educational administration seeking to fill the gap between the idealized abstraction characteristic of principal academic preparation and the demanding reality confronted during their first years on the job, five studies are discussed in this document. First, Ron Hickey outlines the results of his survey of 34 new Kentucky principals and recommends, based on the compiled data, additional orientation in time management, communication with staff, working with  parents, budgeting, and curricular instruction. Second, based on his recently completed study in the Midwest, John C. Daresh delineates the major problems confronting new principals and offers some promising recommendations. Third, Joseph W. Licata describes how a Louisiana State University project has organized a collaborative inservice training effort for 15 new principals. Fourth, Mark E.

The success of QIIP initiated a movement in 1985 to professionalize teaching and led to the development of expanded faculty-administration cooperation in the management of schools. Programs devised and currently in operation under the new school management and decisionmaking effort include the unique restructuring of 12 school environments and their curriculums to confront high dropout rates, Saturday Morning School that combines traditional instruction with computer  games and music education, and company/school cooperation in running and maintaining satellite learning centers. The full potential of the Professionalization of Teaching movement in the Dade County Public Schools has yet to be realized; each year new initiatives are begun and old ones are changed or expanded in the effort to improve school quality.

        "description":"Corporal punishment, the act of disciplining students by inflicting physical pain (usually paddling the child's backside), has recently come under fire due to the public's growing concern over child abuse. Opponents of corporal punishment assert that there is little hard evidence showing that physical punishment promotes character development or produces lasting behavioral change. In fact, opponents claim that corporal punishment can be counterproductive by increasing rather than curtailing antisocial behavior. Corporal punishment supporters believe that coddling students who deserve to be punished is likely to do lasting harm; supporters suggest that children who do not learn that misbehavior has unfortunate consequences may never learn to behave acceptably. Currently, according  to federal court rulings, school authorities can use reasonable physical punishment unless board policies or state laws stipulate otherwise. Across the 32 states that permit corporal punishment in their public schools, the laws vary considerably. Most states provide general authority to administer corporal punishment, but a few discourage this disciplinary technique. Whether corporal punishment continues to be used as a disciplinary tool will ultimately be resolved through the legislative process. (48 references) (KM)",

This paper presents data from indepth structured interviews with 10 principals (5 elementary and 5 secondary) from two school districts (Centremont and Hillview, Pennsylvania). The school principals' leadership roles in teacher-empowered schools are identified and described. Findings define empowerment, address changes in the traditional role of the building principal, and discuss principal leadership behaviors that support empowered teachers. The experiences with teacher  empowerment in these two districts suggest that a clear definition of empowerment is less important than is a commitment to systematically engage teachers in decisions that affect their professional worklives in schools.

The study examined student data from four large school districts in four states where comprehensive state-level reforms have been in effect long enough for a class of students to experience at least three years of high school under the new requirements. The four districts provided computerized records for a total of about 61,000 students. With regard to the performance of educationally disadvantaged students, findings indicated that education reform was neither a disaster nor a boon in the four districts examined. Disadvantaged  students appeared to have improved performance in three of the eight cases. The effects of reform on dropout rates were mixed. Only two districts had sound data to identify dropouts. Increased enrollment in academic courses after reform was associated with a decline in vocational enrollment for disadvantaged students. The appendices include: (1) design and measurement issues; (2) median achievement scores and net gain; (3) the effects of reform in rural school districts; (4) related multistate studies; and (5) a list of major contributors to the report.

Being prepared for crises can enhance the school's effectiveness in responding to smaller incidents. General preventative school security measures recommended by the National School Safety Center include: (1) limiting grounds access during the school day; (2) developing a comprehensive crisis management plan; and (3) establishing a communications network that links classrooms, the schoolyard supervisors, and the central office with local law  enforcement and fire departments. In the aftermath of a crisis, a counseling center should be set up to help students through the grief process and to handle symptoms of posttraumatic stress. To prevent suicide clusters (a group of suicides that occur close together in time or space within a community) school officials must coordinate community agencies and learn the most psychologically effective ways to handle a student's death.

Additional publications deal with: measuring self-esteem in early  adolescents; steps administrators can take to raise students' self-esteem and to help students in middle-level schools enhance their self-perception; ways to block the no-effort strategy employed by students who have a fear of failure; helping students set meaningful goals that they can attain. Finally, one article argues that healthy self-esteem is based on a realistic and responsible assessment of one's self in all its aspects, and accepting the worth and rights of others. (MLF)",

        "description":"American schools, despite recent education reform measures, still fail to provide many of our nation's children with the education that they need and deserve. In conjunction with the other changes, programs of choice can play a central and critical role in improving America's schools. This booklet, divided into two sections, reports on the proceedings at the White House Workshop on Choice in Education on January 10, 1989. The workshop, held in Washington, D.C., was hosted jointly by the White House and the United States Department of Education. The report outlines the benefits--discussed by educators, policymakers, and student--that can be won when programs of choice are carefully planned, developed, and monitored. Section 1 provides the reasons for conducting a workshop on  choice, introduces the two dominant themes that emerged during the workshop, and details eight programs of choice already in operation around the nation. Section 2 explores the benefits of school choice through an examination of the themes of school improvement and parental empowerment discussed during the workshop. At the conclusion of this document are remarks by President Ronald Reagan, President-elect George Bush, United States Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos, Minnesota Governor Rudy Perpich, and Wisconsin Governor Thommy G. Thompson. (24 references) (KM)",

        "description":"Originally presented at a 1986 conference on student discipline strategies, this collection of papers represents highlights of the conference proceedings. Each paper has since been revised and updated. An introduction by Oliver C. Moles discusses the nature, extent, and academic effects of student misbehavior. In \"Classroom Management Techniques,\" Walter Doyle argues that order is not so much determined by the teacher's reactions to misbehavior as it is conditioned by the way teachers organize the system of classroom activities and academic work. In \"School Organization, Leadership, and Student Behavior,\" Daniel L. Duke presents a model of how key organizational elements of schools and school leadership may affect student conduct. The paper \"Courts and School Discipline  Policies,\" by Henry S. Lufler, Jr., examines the link between court decisions and changes in school discipline practices and suggests ways that current research findings can be used to enhance the legal education of school personnel. In \"Developing Effective Organizations to Reduce School Disorder,\" Denise C. Gottfredson discusses attempts to reduce disruptive behavior by changing school practices in ways guided by research. In the final paper, \"School and Classroom Discipline Programs: How Well Do They Work?,\" Edmund T. Emmer and Amy Aussiker examine research on four widely used discipline programs--Assertive Discipline, Teacher Effectiveness Training, Reality Therapy, and Adlerian-based approaches. An appendix contains an annotated list of federally supported research reports on school  crime and student misbehavior for the period 1977-88. (MLF)",

The studies dealt with personnel shortages in special education and related services. The first study, by J. Smith-Davis, P. J. Burke, and M. M. Noel, gathered data for 1982-83. It reported that 22 of 54 jurisdictions (including states, territories, and the District of Columbia) experienced personnel shortages well into the school year. Only one state reported no category of shortage. The most universal shortages appeared in such services as occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech/language/communication, and emotional disturbance/behavior disorder. The second study, by M. J. McLaughlin, J. Smith-Davis, and P. J.  Burke, focused on the 1985-86 period. It found that the most frequently noted shortage areas were in the same fields as in the 1982-83 study. In follow-up interviews, survey respondents in 14 jurisdictions indicated improved conditions over the 1982-83 situation, 13 reported worsening shortages, and the remainder reported no change. Two tables are included which indicate the areas in which personnel shortages exist, by jurisdiction and by 23 categories of special education services. (JDD)",

The approach analyzes data on newly hired teachers from four categories: teachers trained out of state, experienced teachers returning or transferring, teachers newly trained in-state, and teachers on newly issued emergency licenses. These data can be obtained from a state certification/employment computerized data file. States can determine their personnel needs by examining the total number of new hires from the previous year and using that number to project needed personnel. The teacher shortage can then be ameliorated by increasing the availability of new hires. The model outlines factors which impact on the recruitment of personnel, reasons for the shortage of teachers in special  education, and strengths and limitations of this approach to projecting personnel needs.

Teachers with provisional certification were more likely to leave teaching than were fully certified teachers during the first 2 years of the study, but during the third year of the study, attrition rates were comparable. Attrition rates of special education teachers were significantly higher than those of general education teachers. The attrition rate for teachers under age 35 was higher than the rate for teachers over 35. Attrition rates of teachers with graduate training were lower than attrition rates of teachers with undergraduate training only. There were no significant differences in attrition rates among rural and urban teachers. In addition to the statistical analysis, a  survey was sent to 400 Wisconsin teachers, including 100 special education teachers and 100 general education teachers who had remained in teaching, and 100 special education teachers and 100 general education teachers who had left teaching; 61% of the teachers completed survey instruments. Factors highly correlated with teachers remaining in the field included: the opportunity to work on and make decisions about curriculum development, administrative support, support from other professionals, and the nature of the first teaching experience.

Declines are reported in the number of bachelor's degrees in education awarded to minority students and the number of teacher education majors from ethnic groups. Teacher certification examinations are cited as the greatest single barrier to the entrance of minorities to the teaching profession. Reasons for low black representation in teacher education programs include the lower percentage of black high-school graduates who attend  college, the higher standards of college admission which exist today, and minority students' lack of academic background and preparation for college.

The 102 students, with a mean age of 9 years, were administered the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) at the time of resource program placement and during April 1981, to obtain pre-scores and post-scores which were used to calculate a change score. Significant yearly increases in reading, spelling, and arithmetic grade levels were found. However, analyses of age-normed standard change scores showed significant increases in only the reading standard score, with actual decreases in spelling and arithmetic  abilities. The search for significant predictors of academic improvement revealed the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test was the best and often the only significant predictor of grade level and standardized WRAT change scores. Scores on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised were not found to be consistently related to change data. (JDD)",

Recommendations were made for streamlining the process, for improving the communication/interaction between regular and special education teachers, and for classroom instruction. Study results included the finding that referral is a complex legal process that cannot be as quick and responsive as might be desirable, that teachers should receive systematic inservice training about referrals, and that the process is not monitored well. The communication process is seen by some regular and special education teachers to be the responsibility of special education, and procedures are unclear to regular teachers who receive little inservice training in special education  processes. Among recommendations are: (1) forms be simpler and computer-printed with available information; (2) inservice training of teachers should explain the referral process, alternatives to special education, and communication with special education teachers; and (3) a structure should be created to ensure the ongoing monitoring and improvement of the referral process. Seven attachments include a special education assessment memo, legal requirements in the referral process, a flow chart of the referral process, referral forms, and the referral timeline. (DB)",

Assessment consisted of behavioral observations of students' performance during role play simulations. Rating scales were also utilized to measure students' self perceptions and perceptions of their parents and teachers of social performance across settings and time. Highly significant differences were detected on posttest measures between the treatment group (N=24) who received direct instruction in 10 job-related social skills and a matched control group (N=25) indicating the effectiveness of the social skills training package for this  population. Analyses of responses on the student, parent, and teacher surveys were more ambiguous. However, some positive changes in social performance were perceived by the students and their teachers over the academic year. Results suggested that the training procedures were effective in increasing mildly to moderately handicapped students' performance on job-related social skills under controlled conditions. Although students and their teachers perceived relative increases in social skills over time, generalization of treatment effects to natural work settings was not systematically investigated. Extensive appendixes include the job social skills inventory, student and employer job reports, and copies of project publications. (Author/DB)",

Two types of handicapped individuals were interviewed: 65 students in self-contained, vocational education programs and 46 students in resource programs. Students in both groups had unemployment rates comparable to their normal peers on the national and state level. On the local level, however, the unemployment rate of the handicapped individuals was almost twice as high as their nonhandicapped peers. Handicapped males were more likely to be employed than their female counterparts. Respondents who had summer jobs or other work experiences during the year were more likely to be employed than those who did not have these work experiences.  Most handicapped individuals in both groups were satisfied with their jobs and relied heavily upon a \"self-family-friend\" network to find employment. Most handicapped individuals were single, resided with their parents, engaged in a variety of social activities with friends and family members, and expressed satisfaction with their social life. The majority of handicapped respondents reported that they had not pursued postsecondary training or education. An appendix contains the survey instrument. (JDD)",

First, the issues are identified and include services organized around the categorical conditions defined in Federal law, the tendency of categorical certification to adversely affect teacher supply and limit administrative flexibility, and the tendency of too broad certification to result in teachers poorly qualified to teach the range of categories. Research on differentiating characteristics of mild handicapping conditions generally shows only slight differences between the mentally retarded, learning disabled, and mildly emotionally disturbed. Research on instructional methods consistently fails to indicate that different approaches to instruction are  needed for different categories of mildly handicapped students. States have tended to move toward more noncategorical certification raising some concerns about adequate training. Teachers may be trained categorically and then broadly certified and placed. Since certification standards can serve as a major control for quality, states are encouraged to (1) develop certification policies that reflect the two dimensions of functional level and age; (2) provide teacher training that parallels certification policies; and (3) place special education students in classrooms according to the same two dimensions of functional level and age.

Questionnaires were administered before and after the National Cerebral Palsy/Les Autre Games of 1985. Results indicated that the athletes were  characterized as moderately high on coping with disability status and their achievement orientations were similar to those of a sample of non-disabled athletes. Both winners and losers used internal and external attributions to explain performance. Significant differences were noted between severely disabled and less severely disabled athletes in the use of attributions.

Each program description is accompanied by samples of course materials, such as course descriptions, course objectives, course syllabi, student/teacher contracts, workshop materials on cooperative learning and  computers, educational program competencies, a training model for higher education in special education technology, information on a switch-building workshop, and a paper by Ted Hasselbring titled &quot;Effective Microcomputer Training and Implementation.&quot; A prototype training module is presented for integrating technology into special education teacher preparation courses. The module, which focuses on teaching with crossword puzzles, describes formats of crossword puzzles, their uses in several content areas, and their creation through use of computer software. Also included are the &quot;Code of Ethical Conduct for Computer-Using Educators,&quot; developed by the International Council for Computers in Education, and a &quot;Microcomputing Competency Self-Assessment for Special Education Professors.&quot;  (JDD)",

The project concluded that: learning-disabled and behaviorally disordered students exhibit deficits on cognitive and affective aspects of test-taking; these deficits can be partially remediated through training; and standardized achievement testing provides an important function in special education, but additional measures are equally important. Appendices, which make up the bulk of the document, include published and unpublished papers and presentations on: analyzing children's strategy use on reading achievement tests; developing  aspects of test-wiseness for absurd options; test-wiseness on reading comprehension tests; improving test-taking skills; student attitudes toward tests; format changes in reading achievement tests; a meta-analysis on teaching test-taking skills; using separate answer sheets; effects of training in test-taking skills on test performance, attitudes, and on-task behavior; effects of coaching on test performance; academic and intellectual characteristics of behaviorally disordered students; and predicting outcome through achievement.

Planning and scheduling considerations include scheduling assessments when the child is well-rested and avoiding undue length of assessment. Preparing the environment for assessment involves having adjustable tables and foot rests, reinforcers, and toys. Parents of preschoolers exhibit some behaviors which are different from the behaviors seen in the parents of school-age children, such as unwillingness to separate, angry reaction to the labeling of a handicap, and lack of understanding of the special education process. Suggestions  for putting parents at ease include introducing parents to each member of the assessment team and maintaining a friendly but professional attitude.

One goal is to have all children attend school, no matter how severe their disabilities. Though low percentages of disabled children from developing countries attend school, some positive trends are identified, such as implementing educational legislation and placing responsibility for the education of all disabled children with education ministries. As developing countries plan educational services for disabled children, the benefits of mainstreaming must be weighed against the reality of overcrowded schools, inadequately trained teachers, and a curriculum that is not easily individualized. A responsible integration policy that results in real  mainstreaming rather than \"maindumping\" would require support from teachers, specialists, the disabled child's family, other children, and the community. Another goal of special education for people with intellectual disabilities involves helping them to learn and to take advantage of opportunities for life-long continuing education. (JDD)",

A case study approach was used to create a description of two transition programs, based on the perspectives of the various kinds of program participants and sensitive to the situational context in which the program operates. A Santa Barbara (California) School District project focused on transition issues of Mexican-American parents, problems with interagency agreements, the importance of a shared view of transition, and the perceptions of project staff concerning the ideal evaluation report. The second case study, of a community  college program in Grays Harbor, Washington, was selected because it involved private sector coordinators who were not previously experienced in special education, an economically depressed community with high unemployment, and an outside evaluator whose previous work was known to be of high quality. The case study deals with the notion of local success versus national model, the effects of overpromising in grant applications, the evaluator's role in project development, generalizability, and reasonable expectations for evaluation.

Results indicated that families from low socio-economic status groups tended to be very disengaged in terms of their coping skills, while families from higher income groups  tended to be enmeshed or very close-knit families. Furthermore, these low income families had fewer sources and resources for support available to them. An analysis of covariance indicated that significant differences remained between groups based on the cohesion-type from the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales after accounting for differences in family resources, family sources of support, and other critical life events faced by the families involved.

        "description":"The effectiveness of using volunteer reading tutors to work with students with reading difficulties was examined. Changes in academic engaged time, active responding time, achievement, and student attitude were assessed, along with information from tutor evaluations. Nine intervention and 8 control students (grades 3-5) with mild handicaps participated over an 11-week period, with experimental subjects receiving at least 36 20-minute sessions with reading tutors during that time. Observations indicated significantly greater active academic responding (particularly reading aloud) and academic engaged time when students were with tutors, as well as significantly less inappropriate nontask behavior. During the intervention period, higher inappropriate nontask behavior was observed  when the student was not with the tutor during reading time. Follow-up observations of intervention students without tutors revealed that changes in responses were not maintained. Changes over time were not found in achievement or in student attitude measures. Tutor evaluations suggested the possibility of gains in aspects of reading not measured by standardized tests (e.g., expression), as well as several improvements for students in social-emotional areas. (Appended are the Reading Attitude Scale used in the study, the teacher and tutor evaluation forms, and a tutorial training agenda and guidelines.) (Author/DB)",

The introduction provides an overview of State Planning Grants, Iowa's history of early childhood special education, and this project's approach to planning. The methods section outlines the purpose of the State Planning Grant, the needs assessment process, and the involvement of the State Plan Advisory Council for Early Services. Descriptions of the needs assessment sample population, analysis techniques, and a problem solving approach are also included in the methods section. The results section provides a thorough discussion of the descriptive and inferential data analyses for the  professional and parent needs assessments and an analysis of the parent forums. The recommendations list proposed changes based on the data collection. Recommendations center on the need to: improve access to and receipt of services; explore case management issues; increase communication and coordination among service providers and agencies; increase the quality of parent participation; and offer an array of training options to parents and service providers. Twenty-four figures and 18 tables illustrate the data, and 6 appendices comprising the greater part of the report include detailed analyses of the questionnaire items and responses for both the professional and the parent needs assessments, a summary of state plan suggestions, and the parent forum questions.

Four stages of mediation are described: problem identification, generation of problem-solving options, evaluation of options, and agreeing to solutions. Common problems arising at each stage are discussed, such as taking an inflexible stand on an issue, emotional outbursts, prolonged repetition of the same points, personal attacks, premature acceptance of a &quot;solution&quot; without considering all of the relevant variables, and resisting agreement. Mediator's responses to each type of problem are also presented, along with the rationale for each mediator response.  (Author/JDD)",

        "description":"In a federal court case (Timothy W. versus Rochester School District), a public school district was relieved of any obligation to provide special education services for a disabled child who was considered incapable of benefiting from educational services. This case has raised significant questions regarding the scope of school districts' obligations under the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EHA). The judge reasoned that the ability to benefit from instruction is a prerequisite to the school district's provision of educational services, and that children who do not have learning capacity are not intended to receive special education. The judge noted that the child must be evaluated regularly for signs of development which indicate a capability to benefit from special  education. This case has significant implications for school districts in terms of: (1) making threshold judgements regarding whether specific handicapped children are covered by the EHA, and (2) determining responsibility for maintenance costs associated with severely handicapped children's residential placements. Discussed in this bulletin are the legal precedents supporting the court decision, the reaction of advocacy groups for the handicapped, and the question of expending funds from educational budgets to support residential placements.

Background information on borrowing in Icelandic is provided, and a crucial distinction is made between aural borrowing and loanwords from written sources. The role of syllabic structure in the borrowing process is investigated, and it is argued that a syllabic structure constraint regulates the insertion of the minimal consonant /h/. It is further argued that when this constraint applies, consonant length is inferred from vowel length and not vice versa. (MSE)",

        "description":"Recent second language acquisition research has shown that language learners must interact with more competent speakers in order to learn to manage conversation. Such interaction is rare in second language classrooms, but dialogue journal writing, written interaction that shares some of the features of oral conversation, allows for conversational collaboration and encourages the learner to assume substantial responsibility for conversation management. A study analyzed the amount of responsibility students of English as a Second Language (ESL) assume for advancing and repairing the written conversation in dialogue journals. A procedure based on research in conversational analysis was developed to analyze the patterns of &quot;giving&quot; and &quot;soliciting&quot; in the journals of 12 adult ESL  students and their native English speaking conversational partner. This quantitative analysis was supplemented by a qualitative interpretation of the journals of four students of similar linguistic proficiency. The quantitative results showed that the teacher's interaction with the students was consistent, whereas students' interactional patterns varied greatly. The findings suggest that the more active participants are those who make moderate use of each type of conversational &quot;move.&quot; The qualitative analysis explains the great variation in level of conversational responsibility shown by four students of high linguistic proficiency. Sample dialogue journal excerpts are appended. (Author/MSE)",

Program objectives were to improve students' English language proficiency and mainstream them as quickly as possible, develop their native language skills, enhancing their self-image, and provide career-oriented training in computer use. Extensive support services were also provided. The program achieved its objectives in English as a Second Language, native language arts, computer instruction, career orientation, attendance, and one staff development objective; the second staff development objective could not be assessed as proposed. The program did not meet its  objectives in content-area subjects or New Environmental Workshops, and it could not be determined whether objectives in cultural awareness and dropout rates were met. Program participation and staffing dropped during this funding year. Major program strengths included incorporation of computer learning in the content areas and the commitment of staff. Major weaknesses were lack of teacher training in computers, lack of needed social work personnel, and late receipt of program funds. Recommendations for improvement include staff training in computer use, additional social support personnel, increased content area offerings, and rewriting of the cultural awareness objective.

Students received instruction in English as a Second Language (ESL), content area subjects, vocational subjects, and native language arts at some sites. Those schools for which data were available met their instructional objective for the number of passing grades in courses that the program subsidized. However, program students' attendance rates were higher than those of mainstream  students in only 6 of the 9 schools that provided data. Major program weaknesses included lower participation than anticipated, shortage of qualified bilingual teachers and counselors, and initial lack of support from school administrators and teachers. Major strengths included implementation of the ESL component, increased support for teachers and administrators at all sites, training and curriculum development activities, special activities for program students, and the eagerness of schools to expand their services to program participants. Specific recommendations for program improvement are made. (MSE)",

        "description":"Proyecto Nuevos Horizontes (Project New Horizons) at James Monroe High School (New York City) served 328 students of limited English proficiency (LEP) in grades 9-12 during the final year of a 3-year funding cycle. The project's purpose was to build on the strengths of the school's extensive computer-assisted instructional program in order to develop instructional software and provide individualized computer-assisted instruction to supplement the bilingual education program. The bilingual education program consisted of English as a Second Language (ESL), native language arts (NLA), and bilingually taught content area and business courses. Students were recent arrivals from Spanish-speaking countries. Half the students left the program within a year, and one-third stayed for 2  years. The project met its objectives in ESL, NLA, content area subjects, computer-assisted instruction, and attendance. The program did not provide data for assessing cultural heritage appreciation, staff development, or parental involvement objectives. The program's chief accomplishment was acquisition of appropriate instructional software in NLA and the content areas. Recommendations for improvement include: (1) increased contacts between bilingual and mainstream students through sponsored extracurricular activities; (2) development of ways to motivate students to rapidly enter the mainstream; and (3) gathering of data needed to evaluate all non-instructional objectives.

It is suggested that a specialized sequence of native language courses should be offered to populations of language minority students with the same vernacular language. The approach proposed integrates bilingual education, English as a Second Language, and native language arts as a foreign language, in transitional programs. The characteristic making this program unique is the offering of the native language as a foreign language through elementary and secondary education. A significant limitation is that in order to be cost effective, such a program must serve a large population of students of the same native language group. This approach, while having been  implemented to some extent, has not yet been validated. (MSE)",

The program's major goal was to provide the least academically and linguistically prepared students with the instruction in English as a Second Language (ESL) needed for moving into mainstream academic classes. Students received instruction in ESL, native language arts (NLA), and bilingual instruction for some students (Haitian) in mathematics, science, and social studies. Students had the options of enrolling in an ESL typing class, mainstream subjects such as gym and art, and in a hotel and restaurant management program. Non-instructional components included academic, personal, career, and college counseling,  individual and small-group tutoring, an after-school and summer jobs program, and extracurricular activities. While the program did not achieve its ESL objective, over 80% of students passed their NLA classes, and the attendance rate was higher than that of comparable mainstream students. Recommendations for program improvement include (1) restructuring the coordination of the ESL, NLA, and content area components; (2) recruitment of a Haitian Creole-speaking guidance counselor; (3) inclusion of staff development in methodology for ESL, NLA, and content areas; and (4) continued efforts to increase parental understanding of and involvement in the bilingual program.

Findings show that although most students in the population of new-entrant LEP students will lose their entitlement after four years, the students in the lower grades are more likely to exceed the minimum English language proficiency level for eligibility, and do so more quickly, than older students. At the high-school level, nearly two-thirds of the students will leave school while still entitled to bilingual/ESL services, although many of the students graduate or transfer to another school. In light of these findings, and a state recommendation that  English language proficiency minimums be raised for entitlement, it is suggested that administrators: (1) develop accelerated programs, or programs articulated with jobs or post-high school education, for high school LEP students likely to leave school before achieving English competency; (2) develop programs for students who will continue to score below the entitlement cut-point regardless of how long they may be served; and (3) carefully follow the academic career of formerly entitled students to make sure that they are progressing satisfactorily and provide additional services where necessary.

The first study compared two groups of high/intermediate students (n=94) taking ESL in two settings, a traditional university and community extension classes. The second study examined intermediate and advanced students (n=177) in a large adult school, and included a comparison of students from three native language groups (Chinese, Japanese, and Spanish). Certain strategies, such as \"saying answers to oneself,\"\"using English at a job,\"\"getting the gist before looking up new words,\" and \"guessing meanings from actions or context\" were positively related to achievement. Some interaction behaviors such as \"starting conversations simply to  practice English\" or \"relying on gestures to clarify meaning\" showed negative associations with achievement. In the first study, positive attitudes toward second language learning in general and positive attitudes toward experiences in the ESL classroom were significantly related to achievement. In the second study, the only attitudinal factor associated with achievement represented an instrumental motivation for the study of English for occupational or professional purposes. The implications of these results for the teaching and learning of ESL are discussed. (Author/MSE)",

In addition, the children in the study were assessed for general cognitive ability. Results indicated that only the English and Spanish monolingual students differed in home background, with English monolinguals having higher levels of parental education and more traditional literacy activities in the home. In general, students did not differ in basic cognitive functioning or parental expectations.

        "description":"Project TEACH (Technological Enrichment and Achievement for Cambodians and Hispanics) completed the first year of a 2-year extension of federal funding. Administered by Theodore Roosevelt High School's foreign languages and bilingual education department, the project's major goal was to provide students with bilingual instruction in computer technology and business. It served 247 new students of limited English proficiency in grades 9-12. These students were all from low-income families and had little formal education before immigration. The project offered courses, including English as a Second Language (ESL), Spanish, bilingual content areas, computer technology, and business. Project TEACH provided personal counseling, staff development, and parent involvement activities.  Students achieved program objectives for ESL, native language arts, and attendance. Objectives were partially met for content area courses, staff development, and parent participation. Major program strengths continue to be academic, career, personal counseling, and a high attendance rate. Major weaknesses include a low level of parent participation and an inability to offer native language arts to Cambodian students. Recommendations for improvement include increasing parent attendance at ESL and computer classes by holding these classes on weekends, and increasing activities for helping Khmer and Hispanic students understand each other's cultures and values.

An introductory section describes the purpose, goals and objectives, target population, and defines ESL. Part 1 consists of three essays on multicultural education, a  humanistic approach to language teaching for sex equity, and feminism in this cultural context (Chicana feminism). The second part outlines two workshops. The first workshop provides an orientation to the component parts of the Whole Person Approach to ESL teacher training, and includes 12 related activities.

        "description":"A critical analysis of the quadrennial ministry studies within Methodism over the years is presented. The 1944 and 1948 ministry studies were sociological and demographic. A 1952 study was the first try by the Methodist Church to work on definitions and theological understanding of the ministry. In 1960, there was a study of ministry and a subsequent report to the General Conference plus an important publication of papers from a consultation of Methodist theological faculties. In 1964, a study of the ministry in the light of historic Christianity (to clarify church doctrine in relation to ministry) reported that the concept of an ordained laity was indefensible yet recognized the Methodist Church had an ordained laity. It was not accepted by the General Conference. A 1968 report  to the General Conference tied together the concepts of ministry, the sacraments, and ordination. It was adopted by the legislative committee. A 1976 report marked a shift in the church's view of ministry, highlighting the concepts of general and representative ministry. By 1980, the reports moved more away from traditional conceptualizations of ministry, ordination, and even sacraments, with a radical proposal for a new order of diaconal minister. A committee reporting to the 1988 General Conference studied the meaning of ordination, the relationship of ordination to the sacraments, the meaning of itinerancy, the nature of conference membership, and the possibility of a permanent diaconate. Currently the committee plans to present a tentative report and ask for continued study. Several  guidelines for helping deal with basic issues are presented. (SM)",

The confusing and inconsistent treatment of the ministry of deacon is noted along with many factors indicating the present inconsistency in theology and in practice. The implications of the 1976 inauguration of a diaconal ministry are mentioned, noting that the question of ordination or consecration needs to be addressed, and a wider version of work in the world needs to be described. The diakonia in the early church are examined, and theological reflections on the diakonia, representation, and apostlicity are presented. Possible implications of creating a ministry of deacon are examined. The diaconate in other churches (such as Roman Catholic and Episcopal) are noted with  a focus on ecumenical agreements about the deacon and the alternate ordinal. Two controversial issues are whether an ordained diaconate for service would weaken Christian servanthood and whether people should retain the expectation that every elder should first be ordained a deacon. Restoration of an ordained ministry of diaconal service could help regain a crucial dimension of ministry. (SM)",

The responses of 541 incoming freshmen attending the 1988 orientation program at the University of Maryland, College Park, were compared to those of 1,091 freshmen who attended the orientation program in 1978. Results indicate the attitudes toward recruitment of black students and the university's influence to improve social conditions were more favorable in 1988, and black students in both samples were more positive about these actions than were white students. Student commitment toward social change, particulary with regard to increasing the number of black students on campus, is growing. Data also suggest that the  level of commitment may still be at an early level of development. This may reflect general attitudes in the United States, and that tolerance for diversity is a developmental issue with which most incoming college students are just beginning to struggle. Since it is likely that the attitudes of students on campus influence the outcome of initiatives to increase cultural diversity on campus, the success of such initiatives may depend on the institution's ability to facilitate active valuing of cultural diversity.

A longitudinal examination of internal rates of returns to college education for different time periods is included. Some of the reasons for reexamining the issue are: the decline in rates of return was due in part to a large growth of the college-educated cohort size in the early 1970s, the business cycle may also affect the rate of return, and since 1974, the business cycle has gone through a complete cycle (from regression to peak to recession and to more expansion); and if educational expenditures are considered as investment, then the yield should behave similarly to more conventional investment. The model  used in the study is a two-stage simultaneous equation system which corrects for self-selectivity bias. Samples for the various years are drawn from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics conducted by the Survey Research Center of the University of Michigan. Results include the following: the declining rates of return over the first three time periods are consistent with the notion that as schooling expands, the social rate of return should fall; the rates of return to education should follow the same general pattern as investment in other types of assets; and the rate of return to educational investments has policy implications.

        "description":"A study was conducted to examine the factors influencing undergraduate women's likelihood of persistence in their majors, based on Kanter's theory that members of the numerical minority in any group experience role entrapment and performance pressure as a result of their underrepresentation. Interview data were obtained from a stratified, random sample of 636 female undergraduates that included a sampling of Black, Hispanic, Asian and Pacific Islander students. Findings included the following: (1) performance pressure had a statistically significant, negative impact on women's likelihood of persistence in their major; (2) role entrapment had the expected negative relationship to likelihood of persistence, but its effect was non-significant; (3) a curvilinear relationship was  found between enrollment balance and likelihood of persistence in the undergraduate major; and (4) women in male-dominated majors, as well as those in female-dominated majors, were more likely to persist than women in majors where the enrollment was more balanced.

It is argued that education is the most consistent and obtainable means for the empowerment of Black women. The education that is advocated is one in which the conditions of Black women are acknowledged and analyzed, as well as the realities of other peoples, times and places. It is felt that the empowerment of Black women requires the kind of education where the goal is more than the advancement of an individual; it is an education that moves toward changing the conditions of our communities, people, nation and world. The curriculum of such an education must fully address the complexities of Black women's lives. Black  women should be educated for leadership, with an emphasis on leadership as service to others.

        "description":"The radical restructuring of Alaska's public higher education system brought on by the state's 1986 economic collapse is discussed. The plan called for a merger of 11 community colleges with three universities into three multi-campus institutions. It realigned statewide programs in vocational technical education, fisheries and ocean sciences, international business, and rural higher education delivery. It called for the merger of a unionized community college teaching faculty with a non-unionized university faculty. The plan anticipated termination of 100 administrators and a 5% cut in system costs without significant impact on program delivery. The plan was controversial, but 2 years later, the restructuring is nearly done. Factors leading to restructuring, the restructuring  decision-making process, the restructuring process, and results are discussed. Despite the most dramatic general funding reduction to an entire state public higher education system since World War II, the actions taken avoided closing entire institutions, maintained course and program offerings, and allowed the University of Alaska System to avoid the long term negative effects of exigency or significant academic program elimination. Some of the reasons this experience was different from that in other states are: the Board of Regents and President did not bow to the intense opposition to the plan, believing that no acceptable alternative existed; and the focus on restructuring was on maintenance of local program delivery with elimination of local administration rather than closure of  remote or small campuses.

Among the groups with special needs are underprepared students who may be motivated but need skill development, and underachieving students characterized by untapped potential. One means of fostering involvement with university faculty is through participation in small, highly individualized orientation classes with built-in opportunities for one-on-one contact with the professor outside the classroom. A course for underprepared students needing academic and emotional support and skill development might include topics like setting goals and objectives, time management, note taking, reading comprehension, memory, taking exams,  decision making, reducing stress, and mathematics anxiety. Courses for underachievers should focus on instilling the desire to learn within each student. Topics for class sessions should include values clarification, career exploration, time management, health and wellness, reducing stress, creativity, and taking control of life. A third orientation course could be offered to freshmen who are not at risk academically. Topics would include adjusting to college life, developmental tasks of late adolescence and early adulthood, health and wellness, and race and gender issues. This course would not have to be as highly structured as the others. Through application of student development theory to practice, orientation courses can better meet the needs of all freshmen.

Major findings include the following: the annual loan volumes and defaults of the Higher Education Assistance Foundation (HEAF) and  United Student Aid Funds (USAF) multistate guaranty agency programs have grown at faster rates than have Stafford student loans as a whole; differences in default rates among agencies appear to be strongly related to such borrower characteristics as family income and whether students are financially independent; and the HEAF multistate program's default rate has been much higher than the national rate and the USAF rate has been slightly lower.

        "description":"An evaluation is made of the extent to which Scandinavian higher education has been democratized, noting democratization includes the four elements of: subordination of university decision making to parliamentary democracy and to corporate representative bodies; decentralization of higher education regionally; equal access to higher education on the basis of class and gender; and internal democratization of university decision making. Postwar educational reforms in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden are examined with reference to four categories of social choice: scope; policy instruments; distribution; and restraints and innovation. Norway and Sweden have been the most successful in democratizing higher education; Denmark and Finland, while also implementing  significant reform measures, generally have failed to equal the level of democratization reached by the other two countries. Iceland lags behind in terms of the university's subordination to government planners and the lack of equal representation for faculty, students, and staff on university governing bodies. Finland, Norway, and Sweden have been more successful than Iceland in decentralizing higher education regionally. Recent reports indicate that Denmark, Iceland, and Norway have corrected the gender imbalance. While Finland and Sweden have not achieved equality, women in both countries do earn the highest percentage of first degrees. Women in all five countries remain underrepresented on many prestigious faculties and in postgraduate work. Overall, Scandinavian higher education  reform has leveled a number of inequalities, but in the process, university autonomy was eroded and institutions lost decision-making authority in most areas.

The model is described as a representation of the actions taken by humans in their qualitative attempts to move to more progressive states of development through interactions with the environment. The salient attributes of the responses include the quantity, quality, speed of acquisition, utilization, affective tone, generalizability, organizational properties, and intention in the use of information. The model allows a developmentally integrated view of children, especially infants, through an observational perspective which is not separated by arbitrarily established domains of development. The advantages of the model include its usefulness  as: a foundation for assessing the developmental status of infants, a method of establishing developmentally appropriate intervention strategies, and a framework for the evaluation of child-centered early intervention program outcomes. Though use of the model in the 10 years since its development has been limited, it is recommended for utilization in early intervention programs to stimulate positive developmental change in infants.

        "description":"The paper identifies a paradigm shift in research on teaching effectiveness from the process-product approach to explanations from cognitive psychology related to mediating variables which intervene between teacher behavior and pupil performance. Implications of this paradigm shift for research on the effectiveness of teachers of deaf students are drawn. Research on predictors of student outcomes with deaf students has tended to focus on background characteristics of students or on the effects of school placement in a very superficial way. Few studies have investigated the mediating variables between teachers and their hearing impaired students. A set of recommendations linking research on teacher effectiveness with the cognitive psychology framework in the context of deafness  education is offered. The document notes the importance of providing feedback to teachers about their students' behavior and thinking in improving teaching outcomes. Researchable topics related to student and teacher thought processes such as student and teacher expectations, attention, motivation, memory, comprehension and knowledge acquisition, learning strategies, and metacognitive processes are identified. Modifications necessary for dealing with a deaf population are addressed for describing the teaching-learning process from the cognitive perspective. (Author/DB)",

Teaching strategies were implemented by means of a group interaction technology system called \"Discourse.\" Discourse allows the teacher to enter questions and answers into the system and to display them on a large video screen. While questions or problems to solve are displayed, the students enter responses into individual keypads and are given immediate feedback by means of a visual blinking light and audio\"beep.\" In the study, a group of hearing-impaired and severely language-delayed learning disabled students (N=25) were taught mathematical word problem-solving strategies using concept analysis and identification adapted to the Discourse system.

The term &quot;underserved&quot; is defined, the implications of inappropriate curriculum are discussed, and workplace and legislative attitudes that hinder successful transition are reviewed. The third article describes government, education, and industry linkages required to meet the demand for technologically-trained entry-level employees and emphasizes the potential value of the currently  underserved to the economy. The next three articles present the efforts of the Center for Base Technical Education and Transition including a description of the Center's activities, the use of assessment, and a basic skilled-technical curriculum generated by the Center. The final two articles present strategies for interagency cooperation in transition programming and describe an instrument designed to assess the level of interest that regular and special educators have in providing this support.

It describes the emotional side effects of low achievement which may include low self-esteem, clinical depression, \"learned helplessness,\" suicidal ideation, acting out behavior, low frustration tolerance, guilt feelings, interpersonal problems, withdrawal, running away, truancy, juvenile delinquency, and drugs and alcohol. Among the 43 suggestions to parents are: focusing on the positive aspects, providing consistency, getting help from professionals, making use of technology, helping the child improve his/her organizational skills, reading to children, avoiding threats or unkeepable promises, and emphasizing the importance of listening. Finally the paper identifies 20 possible reasons why capable children  may have difficulty learning such as lack of motivation, lack of impulse control, lack of product orientation, fear of failure, procrastination, and too little or too much self-confidence.

        "description":"The study examined the use of expository text structure as a reading and writing strategy with 15 learning-disabled adolescents, 15 normally achieving adolescents, and 15 normally achieving fourth graders. Two reading tasks required students to recognize sequence or comparison-contrast text structure. The third task required students to write endings to partially written paragraphs representing sequence or comparison-contrast text structure. It was hypothesized that learning-disabled adolescents would perform similarly to fourth graders, but poorer than their normally achieving peers. All groups demonstrated sensitivity to text inconsistencies during reading, were better able to identify inconsistent sentences embedded in sequence text than in comparison-contrast text, and  experienced greater difficulty answering questions for inconsistent than consistent comparison-contrast text. However, learning-disabled adolescents performed less well than their peers and similarly to fourth graders in their use of text structure during writing. The lack of many significant correlations among variables for any group suggests the need for research which systematically investigates strategy use across a variety of texts and tasks. (DB)",

        "description":"The paper describes a case-by-case reintegrating strategy for transfer of special education students to less restrictive environments (RLE) stressing \"transenvironmental programming\" (TP), student-directed interventions, and collaborative consultation. Implementation involved 10 experimental subjects and 10 controls who were elementary grade children with behavior disorders originally enrolled in a special school. Transenvironmental programming focuses on acquisition of skills deemed critical for success, and the transfer of these skills from \"training\" to \"target\" environments. TP comprises four phases: environmental assessment, intervention and preparation, promoting transfer across settings, and evaluation in the target environment. Each experimental and control student's most  disturbing behavior was identified and an intervention was implemented, involving a teacher-student contract and monitoring either through interval recording or product inspection. Implementation of the TP process required 10 weeks at the special school and 8 weeks in the LRE school. Meetings with LRE and special school teachers set goals for student behavior, and repeated data collection during intervention led to consideration of the student's transfer to the LRE. Postentry intervention involved two final data collections, an individualized education program meeting, classroom observations, teacher ratings, and student-teacher interviews. All 10 of the experimental students but only five of the control students exited the special school for a less restrictive environment (either mainstream or special class in a regular school). (DB)",

        "description":"This study was undertaken in response to Congressional concern about the relationship between two major federal programs: the Chapter 1 Handicapped Program and the Education of the Handicapped Act (EHA). The study found that, although the services handicapped children receive are similar in both programs, they often are more frequent or more intensive in the Chapter 1 program, reflecting the more serious handicapping conditions of the children involved. The Chapter 1 program is administratively similar to EHA, and the procedural safeguards guaranteed to program participants are the same. Administrative problems exist in that neither Chapter 1 legislation nor regulations specifically limit eligibility to the severely handicapped. Use of the program's transfer provision is no  longer considered an incentive to deinstitutionalize handicapped children, but does allow states to receive Chapter 1 funds for children transferred to local school districts who would otherwise qualify for the lower EHA funding level. It is recommended that Congress restructure the Chapter 1 Handicapped Program to eliminate funding imbalances and assure that all states focus on severely handicapped children. Congress is also urged to enact legislation merging the Chapter 1 program under the EHA program, while considering a separate funding set-aside for states to use to serve only severely handicapped children.

A literature review chapter discusses assessment of health, academic status, and individual strengths/weaknesses, and provides summaries of best practices. In regard to method, a survey of state departments of education found that all states require assessment of achievement data, followed in order of required frequency by: consideration of child's physical condition, child's social/cultural condition, adaptive behavior, and so on. Also analyzed were types of personnel required in identification procedures, consistency with nondiscriminatory guidelines of federal education legislation, and placement criteria for  specific categories of children. Twenty-six Illinois institutions of higher education were surveyed regarding training in student assessment procedures, to evaluate the amount of instructional emphasis given to each of the case study components and perceptions of graduate preparedness to complete case study components. In addition, 549 Illinois professionals involved in special education evaluation were asked to rate usefulness of the various case study components. Components receiving highest rankings of usefulness were: evaluation of learning processes, medical history, level of educational achievement, hearing screening, vision screening, and speech and language. Respondents were also asked how case study requirements should be modified and which professional should have primary  responsibility for each case study component. Results of each survey are described and discussed, and 13 recommendations are presented. Forty references are listed and three appendixes contain copies of the survey forms. (JDD)",

        "description":"This report presents data revealing the participation rates of people with disabilities in Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) programs for the program year July 1, 1987 to June 30, 1988. Four charts are included in the paper. The charts display state-by-state participation rates for: both adults and youth with disabilities in the JTPA's Title II-A programs; youth with disabilities in Title II-B programs, which are the summer programs for youth; and persons with disabilities in Title III, which are the dislocated worker programs and are generally designed to serve an adult worker population. The fourth chart reports participation rates in Title II-A programs for each of the over 600 Service Delivery Areas (SDAs). All persons listed in all charts are program terminees, meaning  that they are program participants who have separated because they have entered unsubsidized employment, completed youth employability enhancements, or terminated for other reasons. Analysis of the data shows that tremendous variation exists in participation rates from state to state and from SDA to SDA and that the number of persons with disabilities benefiting from JTPA programs grows larger every year. An appendix lists representatives of Governors' Committees on Employment of People with Disabilities and state vocational rehabilitation agencies. (JDD)",

Since the overall objective of the job application is to secure a job interview, assessment emphasizes such skills as spelling, following directions/accuracy, neatness/legibility, completeness, and speed. Interviewing skills assessed are grouped into the following categories: appearance and overall quality; ability to convey interest, respect, and self-confidence; describing one's skills related to the position; describing the nature of the disability; describing one's job-relevant attributes realistically; and being able to give a  brief biographical sketch. The assessment process involves a simulated job interview, preferably videotaped for later debriefing. The seven sections of the manual cover the following areas: (1) introduction, (2) job seeking skills assessment procedures, (3) use of assessment results, (4) debriefer instructions, (5) camera operator instructions, (6) background information, and (7) preparing for the assessment.

The purpose of the study was to describe changes in coverage and treatment of individual differences and special populations since the passage of Public Law 94-142 (the Education for All Handicapped Children Act) in 1975. Specific questions included: How are the problems of individual differences and/or special populations presented? How is the role of the teacher described in developing solutions to the problems of individual differences and/or special problems? To what extent are categories or labels portrayed as instructionally useful? Results indicated that there have been changes in treatment of individual  differences and special populations. Advice from a special populations perspective was much more likely to be definitive and authoritative with regard to the education of such populations, and this treatment often suggested a relatively passive role for teachers and a more active role for specialists.

Guidelines for parents are presented as answers to the following questions: What about a child who has a disability? How do you find the right doctor? What do you say to a doctor you have never met? How do you make the first appointment? How do you prepare for your first visit? What do you do when you get to the doctor's office? What should you talk about? How can doctors and schools work together? What  are you responsibilities as a parent? How do you evaluate the situation?

The importance of three systems of support--the family, the school, and the peer group--is stressed. Parents are urged to work toward providing the peer group support and camaraderie of group recreation. Parents are also encouraged to list the child's greatest weaknesses and then identify activities where these weaknesses woul not be noticed. It is recommended that parents who volunteer to lead groups should \"stack the deck\" in favor of learning disabled children by enabling them to avoid the parts of a group activity that would expose their weaknesses while assigning them other  roles that would utilize their strengths. Other ways parents can help is by initiating a new group activity in which all participants are equally inexperienced, having the child practice well in advance for activities requiring tryouts, and having the child try out for activities with few competitors.

The 13 aspects included nine home factors (predictable routine, lack of stress, security, opportunities for the child to develop responsibility, realistic parental expectations, valuing of education by family members, support for completion of school work, support for school policies, and a safe, orderly physical environment). Four out of school time factors concerned  provision of structure by parents, child's involvement in productive activities, time spent watching television, and time spent reading. Differences among groups also were examined as a function of socioeconomic status. Differences in home environments emerged most often between nonhandicapped students and one or more of the handicap groups. The home environments of nonhandicapped students were rated significantly higher on nine of 13 variables.

        "description":"This literature review addresses the technical adequacy of time sampling observation systems, which is fundamental to ensuring the generalizability of data obtained from behavioral observation. Investigations comparing partial interval, whole interval, and momentary time sampling have yielded consistent results. These suggest that duration of behavior is underestimated by whole interval sampling, overestimated by partial interval sampling, and on average accurately estimated by momentary time sampling. Momentary time sampling does not yield data suitable for the estimation of frequency. Partial interval sampling may yield consistent, but not necessarily absolutely accurate, estimates of frequency. Attempts to define the &quot;ideal&quot; interval for time sampling have generated  inconsistent results. Investigations of momentary time sampling have yielded recommended values ranging from less than 30 seconds to 5 minutes. It appears that accuracy of momentary time sampling may be most dependent on overall frequency of observation, necessitating attention to both interval length and the length of the observational session. Little attention has been paid to issues of the representativeness of a behavioral sample drawn from a brief, fixed duration observation. The available literature suggests that massing observations within a fixed duration session may prove less generalizable than will observations spread over time. A list of 114 references is included.

        "description":"The report to Congress on the management of the Federal Office of Special Education and Rehabilitation Services (OSERS) explains findings grouped into five major areas: (1) goal setting, (2) performance management, (3) human resources management, (4) grants management, and (5) federal/state relationships. Questionnaires concerning the management of OSERS were sent to 250 field managers and senior staff, and 187 completed surveys were received and analyzed (a response rate of 75%). In addition, telephone interviews were conducted with state directors of vocational rehabilitation and state directors of education. Finally, preliminary findings were discussed with component heads and selected division directors and branch managers. Among findings were the following: OSERS management  has done a poor job of establishing OSERS-wide goals, and specifically, OSERS lacked; (1) a goal-setting process that incorporated input from each OSERS component; and (2) a formal tracking system to monitor goal implementation. The management of OSERS' components is difficult to measure because of a lack of componentwide strategic plans. In human resources management, some progress has been made in filling vacancies with continuing problems in inadequately trained staff and accessibility of training. Serious problems were identified in OSERS evaluation and monitoring of grantee performance in both discretionary and formula grants. Questionnaire respondents and interview subjects also tended to have negative responses to questions concerning federal/state relationships. Seven appendixes  and 31 figures provide supportive information and statistical data. (DB)",

Specifically, potential discrepancies between the judgments of trained raters and &quot;naive&quot; native speakers of the target language were investigated. Four recorded oral interviews by an ACTFL-trained interviewer and corroborated by a second trained rater, were played to 14 &quot;naive&quot; (untrained) raters. The experiment deliberately attempted to avoid the process of socialization that plays an important part in the ACTFL training of interviewer-raters. Raters were given a Spanish translation of the generic ACTFL oral proficiency scales and at least  one day to study them. The &quot;naive&quot; raters evaluated the recordings based on their own understanding of the scales, without outside interpretation. The results suggest that current knowledge of native speakers is inadequate for prediction of their assessment of non-native speech, even with the use of the scale, raising questions about the generalization of native-speaker reactions as indices of a candidate's proficiency.

The resolution of some of the problems in Judeo-Spanish texts using the &quot;aljamiado&quot; writing system are reviewed, including the use of some Hebrew consonants as vowels, representation of Judeo-Spanish sounds non-existent in Hebrew, and phonetic variations not resolved by context. Difficulties encountered in the transcription of aljamiado texts into the Roman alphabet are then examined. These difficulties include the lack of an accepted standardized system for transcription, representation of stress, adjusting the transcription to serve different purposes, such as historical study vs. accessibility to lay readers, and the legitimacy of transliteration. Six specific suggestions for transcription are  made, and 3 transcriptions of the same text by different people are appended.

The second deals with aspects of French language learning by children. Chapter 3 is concerned with the historical dimensions of French language learning and use. The perspective assumed is both historical and comparative, extending to pidginization and creolization as processes of linguistic evolution. Chapters 4 and 5 discuss methodological aspects of research on French outside of France. Chapter 4 describes French language contact in both North  and West Africa.

The study focused specifically on the similarities and differences in the questions asked by native-speaking (NS) teachers of ESL and by non-native-speaking (NNS) teachers of EFL, and to assess the relationship between teachers' question types and students' responses. Results suggest that: (1) the power of wh-questions is strong, triggering longer and more syntactically complex utterances than yes/no questions; (2) teachers should note that higher-level cognitive questions might increase the length and syntactic complexity of students speech; (3) NNS teachers may paraphrase questions in more cases, but not simply repeat  them with one turn when students have difficulty answering; (4) in some contexts, teachers should give students frequent speaking turns and as much speaking time as possible; and (5) as in natural discourse outside the classroom, two-way or multi-way exchange of information is ideal for genuine communication. Further research on interactional features of teachers' questions, characteristics of followup questions, relationships between syntactic and cognitive question types, and the relationships between length and complexity of teacher questions and student responses is recommended.

Two aspects of articulation are addressed: high school-college curriculum redundancy and the changing demographics of the college population, affecting the appropriateness of many introductory college-level courses. Benefits seen in concurrent enrollment programs include acceleration of progress for students, reduced tuition costs, reassurance for parents concerning their children's ability to handle college-level academic responsibilities,  relief of high school senior ennui, productive interaction between high schools and colleges, improved high school faculty status, enhanced high school standing, facilitated student recruitment, grant opportunities, school-college faculty interaction, enhanced college-community relations, and social equity. Programs at Syracuse University (New York), Florida International University, Kingsborough Community College (New York), LaGuardia Community College (New York), Seattle University (Washington), and the Minnesota and Florida statewide programs are described.

The Cleveland (Ohio) Scholarship Programs were launched in 1967 to provide supplementary scholarship assistance and financial aid counseling to over 1,000 area students annually. Also in Cleveland, the Scholarship-in-Escrow Plan, begun in 1987, sets aside money for secondary school students earning good grades. In 1984, Boston (Massachusetts) built into a privately-sponsored Plan for Excellence in the Public Schools a program called ACCESS for Boston public school students based on Cleveland's original concept. Corporations and area foundations raised an endowment fund of $5.5 million with interest earnings paying for ACCESS  counselors and scholarships. In 1988, over 1,000 high school seniors received advice on college attendance and financial aid, with ACCESS awards averaging over $500. The Cleveland and Boston models are important because: (1) all students, not just those from one grade of a school, are eligible; (2) expert counselors provide guidance to students and parents; (3) aid is available year after year; and (4) existing federal, state, and campus aid sources are tapped. Other cities and several states have launched similar initiatives. Twelve additional sources of information are listed. (MSE)",

In a separate report, the Southern Regional Education Board has suggested 12 goals and specific indicators of progress for each; this report presents information pertaining to the goal of maintaining or increasing the proportion of state tax dollars for schools and colleges while emphasizing funding aimed at raising quality and productivity. It proposes that indicators of progress in this case include: (1) providing annual financial statements to governors, legislators, and citizens on success in  implementing funding plans for education; (2) agreeing at the state level on funding plans that emphasize raising quality and productivity; (3) evaluating the effectiveness of selected school and collegiate programs and linking the results to funding decision; and (4) establishing a state competitive grant process that assigns dollars where they will have the biggest impact on promoting specific initiatives. Specific suggestions and supporting information are given. (MSE)",

Using three separate measures, the study found that on average, 4.4% of 10th-12th graders dropped out of high school annually in the years 1985-88, down about 2% from 1978; nearly 13% of all 16- to 24-year-olds were not in school and had not completed school in 1988, down from 16% in 1968; and among a sample of 1980 high school sophomores, 17% had not graduated by 1982, but 46% of these non-graduates had completed school by 1986. The study also found that: the dropout problem is particularly pressing among Hispanics and the rate is not declining; nearly one-third of Hispanics have completed no more than six years of school;  overall dropout rates, particularly for blacks, have declined in the last decade; differences in dropout rates of blacks and whites have decreased significantly; dropout rates for whites and blacks are similar when individual and family background are taken into account; and dropout rates are higher in the South and West.

Information is presented as follows: theoretical framework; labor markets within higher education; and the structure of administrative work (administrative unit, functional specialization, position type, and pay level). The theoretical predictive model is a priori posited to address the question of whether decisions to promote or hire are influenced by market domains of the vacancy. Data were gathered from official university personnel records, with all vacancies for regular, full-time positions from each fiscal year (1982-1985) included and  analyzed. The findings indicate internal labor market theory offers a rich framework for understanding the functioning of markets in university administrative appointments. The clear patterns of promoting and hiring evidenced confirm that opportunity for promotion and mobility are influenced by market domains associated with the position. Such patterns reflect the practice of hiring officials who are making decisions based upon their perception of a complex array of norms regarding promotion and recruitment within the organization. It is not known to what extent market domains supercede other such considerations in decision making. Contains 34 references. (SM)",

Data were collected by a survey with 164 items distributed over nine topical areas: academic culture; academic innovation; academic workplace; academic management climate; faculty motivation and effort; faculty involvement; academic administrative support; resource availability; and personal data. It was given to full-time administrators and faculty at 10 institutions. Thirty paths of  interest were identified as a result. The most prominent faculty characteristic affecting perceptions of satisfaction, motivation, and commitment was gender. Women consistently viewed organizational environment more positively than men, and so were more satisfied and motivated. The community colleges in the study were distinct from the liberal arts and comprehensive institutions in the way that culture and climate interacted to affect personal satisfaction, commitment, and motivation to undergraduate education.

Results include the following: several of the belief/perception variables that had significant effects on the teaching behaviors were not affected by field or doctoral preparation measures; generalizations about the negative consequences of hiring doctorally prepared faculty are not fully supported (since doctoral preparation did influence teaching behavior but the effects were usually indirect); doctorally prepared faculty report greater involvement in grant preparation, journal editing, association activities, research, and journal publication; and doctorally prepared people are not dissatisfied with their careers as community college faculty members.

The type of training for academic administrators and the significance of this training for degree recipients and for colleges and universities are examined. The study questions whether it is feasible to expect that graduates of these programs are more prepared for administration or behave differently than administrators who have not completed these programs. The nature and content of doctoral study in higher education is not well understood by individuals unacquainted with higher education programs. An examination of the literature indicates: (1) discussion about the knowledge base in the field of  higher education dominates the literature; (2) the skills most emphasized are those emphasized in graduate programs generally (research and writing skills); and (3) the outcome of conceptual competence has received the most attention. Lack of agreement about programmatic purposes affects the ability to higher education programs to evaluate themselves and develop evidence of their effectiveness. The effectiveness of program graduates and programs cannot be fully assessed until there is a better understanding of what knowledge and skills are needed in university and college administration. Not all faculty members are uniformly committed to the programmatic purpose of preparing administrators, and this is a hinderance to assessing the effectiveness of graduates. Contains 59 references.

The impact of several correlates of publications within doctoral universities and comprehensive colleges and universities were evaluated, thus addressing several questions about the extent to which organizational factors and individual differences in preparation, prior activities, and perceptions influence faculty publication. Data for the study were drawn from &quot;Faculty at Work,&quot; a national survey conducted by the National Center for Research to Improve Postsecondary Teaching and Learning in 1987 and 1988. In addition to standard socio-demographic and career indicators, the survey instrument measured faculty perceptions of their colleges and  universities as well as their own competence and efficacy, values and beliefs, and psychological dispositions. Measures of career, self-knowledge, social knowledge, behavior, and environmental response were created for the study. Results indicate that the proposed model for understanding faculty publication differences is a useful one.

Research is reported based upon case studies of four allied health programs in one university with the intent to employ concepts from the organizational literature to describe a group of curriculums, and to determine if relationships among variables exist and yield a coherent explanation. The four programs were medical technology, nuclear medical technology, physical therapy, and physician assistant. The programs are distinct in having varying relationships to the dominant health care profession of medicine. Descriptions of each program were combined into one descriptive case study with the goal to promote internal validation by utilizing multiple sources of data and  the perceptions of multiple investigators, and then rely heavily on internal consistency as the criterion of validity wherever possible. Results are discussed according to: environments of academic programs; boundary setting and boundary spanning; curriculum as an organizational technology; and outline of a tentative model. Curriculum can be most adequately explained by considering it an organizational phenomenon. Higher education curriculum might benefit from an emphasis on more complex organizational technology and structure issues. Contains 44 references. (SM)",

        "description":"Configuration, strategy, and leadership style in five Brazilian universities are examined. Though research tends to focus on the university as a professional bureaucracy, it is demonstrated that other configurations are also applicable. The link between configuration and strategy making is traced, with insights into how strategies are formed in universities provided. Ways in which leaders set strategic direction are examined. Topics of discussion are: (1) decision making and structure in higher education (bureaucracy, collegiality, political model, organized anarchy, mixed models, and models of governance in higher education); (2) the business literature; (3) configuration: a framework for analysis; (4) strategy making in the university; (5) Brazil's universities; (6) university  configurations (organized anarchy, the political arena, the adhocracy, the missionary organization, and the machine bureaucracy); (7) strategy making (disconnected academic strategy, emergent strategy, umbrellas and ideology, and planned and unrealized strategy); and (8) leadership style and strategy. Administrators may focus on elements other than academic strategy. Academic strategy corresponds to university outputs (research and teaching) and inputs (staff and students). Physical strategy is related to the various support components on which the university relies to get its work done (physical facilities, fund raising, and support staff). They are usually centralized functions and are more amenable to central intervention. A third area concerns the governance of the university which  can facilitate the work of the university or perhaps impede it. Contains 86 references. (SM)",

Surveys from 265 faculty members at eight midwestern institutions with schools of education were analyzed. Analysis indicated that a significant proportion of global affective response to faculty work was predicted by the autonomous and creative nature of academic work itself, perceptions of participation in administrative decision making,  perceptions of the fairness of administrative evaluation, perceived esteem by peers in the university community, and financial compensation. There were no main effect or interaction differences in job satisfaction by tenure, gender, or rank. The model used compared favorably to the other models (need fulfillment, sum-of-facets satsifaction, and absolute discrepancies between needs and desires).

Four research questions examined: the physical and organizational features characterizing the institutions; the nature of institutional policies related to out-of-class activities; opportunities available for student involvement; and how elements of institutional culture and subcultures influence student involvement. Issues of qualitative research addressed include team composition, data collection, observations, data analysis, establishing trustworthiness and credibility, transferability of findings, and dependability and confirmability. Among conclusions were that multisite qualitative research  using multiple investigators is time consuming and expensive, and that the composition of the research team is critical.

Using Allport's contact theory which defines the conditions necessary for integrated environments and an input-environment-outcome model, the study compared responses of 4,112 students surveyed by the Cooperative Institutional Research Program in both 1982 and 1986. Data were analyzed (hierarchical multiple regression and analysis of variance) in terms of the model's four components: student input or pre-enrollment characteristics, environment-structural traits,  environment-involvement characteristics, and outcomes. Results included: (1) between the freshman and senior years, social concern values declined for white students and increased for black students; (2) racial diversity did not contribute either positively or negatively to student value development; (3) involvement was a critical factor regardless of race, gender, and institution type in students developing greater social concern values; and (4) students attending predominantly white public four-year institutions became less socially concerned over the years and were less involved.

Findings indicated the following: the University of Manitoba is not doing a particularly good job of keeping MLAs informed of its interests and concerns; 47% of those interviewed are dissatisfied with the level and types of information they are receiving from the university; 74% would like to receive additional information. Three recurring themes were: (1) legislators place a high value on secondary relations (the unofficial, less formal contacts between government officials and university  personnel); (2) institutions should proceed slowly and cautiously in their attempts to improve university-government relations; and (3) the University needs a more positive approach to selling itself.

The three areas of focus were visibility and review, selection criteria, and scholarly engagement and reward. The study was structured in terms of institutional or professional culture to determine if there are cosmopolitan aspects of the textbook that can be discussed in common terms yet be responsive to differences in concerns. Structured interviews, open-ended discussion, and questionnaire forms were used with 84 faculty members, 28 department heads (in 7 discipline areas), and 67 journal editors. Textbooks were definitely shown to be disciplinary vehicles with little deliberate interdisciplinary content. Many faculty members altered  their textbook selection practices solely on the basis of price. Critical reviews of textbooks played virtually no role in the selection process. Selection was dominated by the complimentary copy. There was strong support for the scholarly worth of pre-publication reading and evaluation of textbooks for publishing house. Charts on the following topics are included: study group composition; content, reputational, pedagogical, and production value; decision triads; faculty perception of textbook price as a distinctly separate selection criteria; and research notions (textbooks and the scholarship of pedagogical authoring).

It is important that there be mechanisms by which students in doctoral programs receive deliberate orientation to institutional and career characteristics of higher education and faculty service. Programs in higher education should assemble a repertoire of export seminars addressing various aspects of the institutional environment of higher education. These programs could then be marketed to central administration and deans of  colleges as components in the various intercollege seminars that characterize most doctoral programs.

The review of the literature focuses on ways in which changes in the external environments of universities have affected professors' research. These changes are considered from three perspectives: (1) complications associated with different types of external organizations--academic associations, the federal government, private industry, and the organized public; (2) issues related to different disciplinary sectors internal to the university; and (3) aspects of the relationship between external and internal parties  based on two types of theories of organization-environment interaction--resource dependence and institutional theories. It is concluded that: significant changes in the faculty-institution relationship are occurring; increasingly complex arrangements with external groups make control of faculty behavior more problematic; and as research relationships come to have the character of governmental or corporate contracts, the special norms of autonomy and self-regulation which have distinguished academic work in the past tend to have less certain status.

Liberal arts institutions (N=123) were surveyed to determine the relationship between access and tenure selectivity. The first stage of the study was a description of the range of access available in the study population. In order to determine the relationship between access and selectivity, an operational measure of selectivity was developed based on the percentage of individuals granted tenure in a given review cycle and the percentage of a given faculty cohort eventually granted tenure. Results confirm traditional perceptions of tenure review as an extremely closed process which provides the tenure candidate with very limited  information about the evaluation which is conducted. The results indicated that increasing degrees or different types of access available to tenure candidates did not predict decreasing selectivity evidenced by the institutions surveyed. Confidential review processes did not appear to be a prerequisite to high selectivity. Conceivably, a balance exists between disclosure that will serve both the candidate's interest in rebutting inaccuracies or falsehoods and in being protected from unnecessary disclosure of negative information; and the reviewer's interest in retaining a reasonable degree of anonymity.

Findings indicated  that: state independent sector representatives see aspects of student aid policy or funding as the most important state-level policy issue facing independent institutions today; there is substantial agreement among state higher education agency and independent sector representatives as to the general level of independent sector involvement in state planning (characterized as moderate); and state policies that affect the independent sector, while seemingly disparate, actually tend to be related.

These differences are important to individuals seeking optimal locations, and within groups seeking equitable treatment in locational assignments. Indexes for these factors are reported for 579 cities together with state averages. Spatial price differences for the goods and services purchased by families for everyday living are reported by a geographical Cost of Living Index. Four parts are as follows: (1) cost of living (cost index theory and guides for compilation, cost of living defined and nature of differences, cost of living pricing, and cost of living index compilation); (2) amenities (amenity concepts and theory and  regional preference curves and amenity measurement); (3) wages (measurement of prevailing wages, equilibrium wages under pure competition, and prevailing wages and regional amenities); and (4) cost of public services (cost of government services index). Two appendices are regression analysis to predict consumption and home ownership costs and state and local government budget. Eight text tables are attached. Contains 43 references. (SM)",

        "description":"Pennsylvania State University Beaver Campus developed crisis guidelines and a formal working relationship with a local community mental health center in order to be able to deal with on-campus crises and their followup. The guidelines provide each employee with a single, easy-to-follow document that outlines the decision making process to be followed in various crisis situations (e.g., rape, suicide attempts, and alcohol abuse). To provide access to professional counseling and care when necessary, there is an annual contract with the local community mental health center. The development of such crisis guidelines requires involvement from a large segment of the campus (e.g., security, university relations, residential life staff, and the health center). The chief student affairs  officer and campus president should appoint a working crisis team and plan to develop and implement the crisis guidelines. The following areas should be addressed: media relations; rape protocol guidelines; suicide guidelines; names and home phone numbers of the campus crisis team; what to do if medical attention is needed; phone numbers of local police, hospitals, mental health centers, women's centers, and campus security; involuntary withdrawal procedures; transportation issues; and crisis and administration followup. The demands placed upon the counseling and residential staff of a small college when dealing with a suicidal or emotionally disturbed student can be very difficult. Development of crisis guidelines and a formalized relationship with the local mental health center can  provide support for the staff and give students who need assistance quality service. (SM)",

In college, students are drawn from different states and school districts, and even different parts of the world. A part of a truly liberal education is the study of the history of engineering and mathematics. Physical education and leisure studies are also important. Such an education will affect society, providing a better work environment as people better understand one another's differences. A truly liberal education will help supervisors and managers realize that workers are capable of making a meaningful contribution to the company or  organization, thus resulting in more loyal workers. It is through a truly liberally educated populace that it will be possible to build a great society, and America can become the great nation that the founding fathers intended it to be, where people of different races, sexes, religions, and national origins can find life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

        "description":"The University of Maryland at College Park is committed to ensuring that faculty salaries are based solely upon the contributions and accomplishments of the individual faculty members. The relationship between male and female faculty salaries is carefully monitored. The 1989 female faculty salary reviews (done in relation to the salaries of comparably situated men) examined the current salary of tenure-track female faculty members and recommended individual adjustments to the deans, if warranted, on the basis of the woman's merit in comparison with that of male counterparts. The review process focused primarily on the equity of female faculty salaries (though the committee was open to identifying male faculty members in similar situations). To assist the college salary review,  the Office of Institutional Studies provided several kinds of faculty data (name, rank, sex, level, date of highest earned degree, and current salary). Following the review, adjustments were recommended for a total of 32 women and 4 men. A total of 19 women and 4 men received $36,138 in special merit adjustments ($29,266 for women and $6,872 for men). The statistics indicated that total female faculty salaries in fiscal year 1989 were $57,923 greater than those predicted from men's 1988 salaries. The four appendices cover: background; statistical study design; units reviewed in 1989; and linear regression analysis. Contains 6 references. (SM)",

        "description":"A model for enhancing the educational effectiveness of an African university was developed through the West Virginia University-Bayero University, Kano (Nigeria) linkage activities carried out from 1984-1988. The three goals of the model were to: further develop abilities of African university faculty to carry out research, curriculum development, and service activities; provide workshops, seminars, and courses at the home institution to help with faculty development; and expand the knowledge and experience of faculty and students in an exchange program. Project activities were focused by an Education Development Center, the purpose of which was advancement of knowledge and understanding of education and educational development in the university's service area. Faculty at the  African university collected and continue to collect documents and materials for placement in the center. Significant increases in library space and holdings were reported at the African university site. In working with an African university, it is important to involve both African and American university staff as equal partners, and the use of coordinating committees at both sites is an appropriate mechanism for doing so. Setting up such a center is also a productive way to achieve program goals. The center focuses activities towards specific goals and encourages the interaction necessary to work toward change and development. (SM)",

Quantitative data (using pre-, post-, and retention tests) indicated that understanding of the concepts had been increased by &quot;heatlab.&quot; The amount of structuring was shown not to make a significant difference, neither as a main effect nor in interaction with fear of failure. In a socratic remedy of a misconception, the structure imposed upon the  discovery process is aimed at inducing a paradox which forces the student to re-evaluate his/her beliefs. Students' reactions to paradoxes were examined, with a focus on the circumstances under which surprise reactions occur and the effect of varying the amount of structure on these reactions. Qualitative data (analysis of a think-aloud protocol) indicated an interaction between fear of failure and structuring in that there is no socratic learning for high fear of failure subjects in the unstructured condition.

Some anticipated outcomes (more rapid turn-around of assignments and greater ease on the part of students in creating and editing assignments) were accomplished to varying degrees. Others (student use of specialized writing tools such as spelling checkers, and student-student electronic interaction) were not accomplished to any appreciable extent. A number of organizational and  technological lessons were learned. Some had only local implications, but a number of them are generalizable to other institutions. The print-based instructional materials used by the students are included as an appendix.

The first of eight sections presents the specific aims of the project, which were to: (1) examine the current use of computers for the support of learning programs; (2) examine attitudes of students, parents, and teachers toward the use of computers in learning programs, and to determine whether any differences exist in attitudes between boys and girls, male and female teachers and parents, and between public and private schools; (3) to review and analyze Australian and overseas literature to identify training and teacher development needs and other  targeting of programs that may be required; and (4) to examine other forms of support or assistance that could lead to an improved use of computers for learning purposes. The second section provides a literature review of computer applications in schools and attitudes of teachers, parents, and students; the third describes the survey design used in the study. Results of the survey are reported in the fourth and fifth sections, which outline computer uses, attitudes, and sex differences. The sixth section provides data from the student questionnaire on topics such as perceived competence and computer use, computer attitudes, and differences between female users and non-users. The seventh section comments on sex differences in computer use and attitudes; a summary and recommendations are  provided in section eight. (72 references) (GL)",

In the first phase, a procedural elaboration sequence was designed using the Simplifying Assumptions Method. In the second phase, a prescriptive-theoretical elaboration sequence independent of the procedural sequence was designed. A descriptive-theoretical elaboration consisting of principles which describe how the procedures work was designed in the third phase. In the final phase, the three sequences were integrated into a single course sequence. A prescriptive-to-descriptive-to-procedural sequence was selected as the logical order of presentation. Results show that it is possible to have parallel elaboration sequences of different content orientations (procedures and principles) integrated  within a given course. Advantages of this design include: (1) students progress from simple to complex principles and procedures at the same time; (2) students develop both procedural and theoretical schemata while learning the interrelationships between the schemata; and (3) the designer is reminded of procedures or principles which might otherwise be missed. The phases and steps for designing related elaboration strands are outlined. The appendixes include an outline of the Simplifying Assumptions Method and the initial and revised blueprints for each of the three elaboration sequences. (13 references) (MES)",

A total of 62 MES field staff members participated in information-gathering meetings where they received a questionnaire examining information and technology aspects of program operations, participated in a group discussion about current methods of information distribution, viewed and listened to videotape and audiotape demonstrations of four new technologies (CD-ROM, audiotex, satellite teleconferencing, and interactive videodisc kiosk), completed a survey on the new technologies, and took part in a discussion of the  technologies. Computer communication, educational software, software training, computer-assisted recordkeeping and educational support technology (e.g., voice mail, desktop publishing, and telefacsimile) were also assessed. The study found that most of the technologies have applications for MES staff but that expense, technical demands, and training are barriers to implementation. Tables provide data on methods used by staff for internal communication, methods used for external communication, resources needed by staff, responses to the survey on new technologies, new technology interests, and use of online database services.

The success of this program and the emergence of interactive video as a significant training medium persuaded the Nightingale Project to carry out a feasibility study into the requirements for a successful implementation of an interactive video for nursing education. This paper describes the various levels of detail involved in the design of the video, the knowledge elicitation procedures that were used, the range of teaching strategies employed, and the various problems encountered together with the solutions developed to overcome them. The aims of the  feasibility study were to: (1) identify the range of different skills required to design interactive video courseware; (2) identify the resource implications in terms of staff time and hardware and software requirements; (3) assess the likely availability of skills within the nursing profession to carry out the design and implementation of such a project; and (4) determine the requirements for and cost of technical support from outside the profession. The need for a team approach to the design and development process involving subject matter experts and designers led by an educational systems analyst is highlighted.

Arguing that significant inequalities in educational opportunities still exist, Major R. Owens (Representative from New York and chairman of the subcommittee) points out that these inequalities are most evident in the nation's inner cities and among minorities. He further argues that the federal government has a clear responsibility to provide leadership in the conduct and support of the scientific inquiry into the educational process that is necessary to achieve the goal of quality education. A major problem  identified by Owens is the need for additional support for school systems that must provide effective educational programs for at-risk students. The primary concerns addressed by this hearing are the relevance of OERI and its activities to urban schools, at-risk populations, and minority populations; the scale of the long-term problems in education; and effective research and improvement strategies that can adequately respond to these problems. In addition to the opening statement and a prepared statement by Owens, this report includes testimony and prepared statements from six witnesses: (1) Robert A.

        "description":"In 1988, the Missouri State Library offered microcomputers to Missouri public libraries to help them implement a retrospective conversion of their cataloging system to an online system called Bibliofile. The goal of the State Library was to create and maintain a Union Catalog for Missouri libraries. This guide provides Missouri library personnel with basic information on: (1) setting up the system (e.g., how to plug in cables and how to hook up a printer); (2) operating the computer equipment (e.g., how to insert a floppy disk into the &quot;A&quot; drive and how to format disks); (3) what the available menu options consist of (e.g., Bibliofile, word processing, telecommunications, reference databases, and computer-assisted instruction); (4) how to use the maintenance operations menu  (e.g., backing up disks and restoring data); (5) how to use the CD-ROM Bibliofile system (i.e., step by step instructions for conducting a search and creating catalog cards); and (6) troubleshooting four common problems. The brief technical programming notes which conclude the guide include a list of the subdirectories of the system. (SD)",

The guidelines comprise the collaborative effort of hundreds of conference participants and representatives from 79 libraries throughout the United States and Canada, who discussed the guidelines in regional and state sessions and/or tested all or part of the guidelines under actual service conditions. Designed to serve as baselines against which administrators can consider the effectiveness of bookmobile programs, these guidelines are not standards, but professional advice about bookmobile service. They are presented in six sections, which discuss in detail: (1) working specifications for a bookmobile vehicle, including information about types and  brands of tires and batteries, as well as information about auxiliary power units and safety equipment; (2) scheduling, including how to choose appropriate service hours and duration of each stop; (3) library collection development, including policy, personnel, and the variety of the collection; (4) marketing and publicizing the service, encouraging consistency with the library system's program, and involving the community in the program's development; (5) staffing the bookmobile, including suggestions for training in communications skills, driving, and general safety; and (6) management, including issues of funding, maintenance of the vehicle, and integration into the library system.

The solicitation for cost containment projects also gave emphasis to approaches that can be transferred to other institutions or other groups of institutions. The final report of this project describes the organizational structure and purposes of the Washington Research Library Consortium (WRLC), identifies cost containment issues addressed by the project, and offers the WRLC solutions to these issues. Presented are benefit analyses of projected capital investment and  operational costs for WRLC programs, when actual costs and cost savings are known or when they can be estimated. Descriptions of the various approaches under consideration and discussions of the major cost factors are provided when information on costs and cost savings are not yet available for programs to be added in later phases. The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws for the WRLC, a profile of the WRLC, cost estimates for database creation, and a successful application to the National Endowment for the Humanities are appended to the report.

        "description":"This study investigated online searching behavior manifested by 39 experienced professional searchers performing their regular, job-related searches in order to uncover the rules they use for the selection of search keys, and to represent these rules in a formal model that could be used in the construction of intermediary expert systems. The case study method with controlled comparison was used, and data analyses were based on two existing models: the Selection Routine, a decision tree presenting the rules used to select search keys by eight searchers in a previous study, and a list of moves, or modifications, in search strategies that was based on observations of the searching behavior of the same eight subjects. Two types of moves were identified: operational moves that  preserve the meaning of a request, and conceptual moves that change the meaning of a request. Within each type, the moves are presented in three groups: precision moves; recall moves; and moves to increase precision and recall. Data analysis involved measuring the frequency with which each type of search key was selected, each move was selected, and a reason was cited to explain the selection of a search key. The statistical associations among 11 variables were also examined for each search: (1) number of search keys selected; (2) percentage of free-text terms used; (3) frequency with which a thesaurus was not consulted; (4) number of databases used; (5) number of moves made; (6) percentage of operational moves made; (7) number of precision moves made; (8) number of recall moves made; (9)  percentage of recall moves made; (10) the searcher's subject area specialty; and (11) the searcher's work environment. It was concluded that searching behavior is lawful and follows certain patterns; current systems cannot provide satisfactory recall and some are even an impediment to useful searching practices; and the requests presented by users are the least predictable of the factors that affect searching behavior.

The purpose of the survey was to: (1) compare funding patterns in state and private institutions; (2) compare appropriation increases with rising costs for books and journals; and (3) determine whether academic libraries in Texas have the funds necessary to meet the needs of their faculty and students. Survey results document that most of the libraries at both public and private institutions of higher education are in distress. Support for the acquisition of books and journals has not been sufficient to adequately keep pace with the costs of the increasingly expensive information resources and expanding enrollments. The vast majority of academic  libraries are either in the process of or have recently completed extensive serials cancellation projects; at one state institution, alone, over 11,000 journals were cut over a two-year period. Results also indicate that since fiscal year 1986, funding has not kept pace with inflation, and that the funding situation appears to be worsening.

The report then analyzes the functions and components of the Shafer Library in relation to Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) standards. Volume I extensively evaluates and describes the following aspects of the Shafer library: physical facilities; personnel; collection development; circulation; library instruction; and the budget and expenditures. Three areas are identified as having highest priority: (1) library personnel needs to be increased at both the professional  and the paraprofessional levels; (2) both print and nonprint materials need to be expanded and updated; and (3) audiovisual equipment must be acquired and replaced to enable a smoothly functioning media center. Within the text, 11 tables organize data and seven graphs depict trends. Appendixes include the floorplans for the Shafer library; a list of 18 colleges in the library cost and service analysis study; and lists of audiovisual equipment in the non-print media center and instructional and information guides in the Shafer Library collection. Ten references are listed. Volume II provides a profile of the library at the time of the study. (SD)",

        "description":"This essay explores the somewhat uneven course of the public library as a knowledge institution in America and its relevance during the current information age, particularly in the United States, where there is a basic connection between access to knowledge and the political system. The public library situation is considered in terms of the dichotomy of consumption, (i.e., the assumption that services to the poor are in themselves a public good and should be provided to alleviate personal need), and investment (i.e., the assumption that the use of services provided to the poor will ultimately result in productive contributions to society). The history of access to information in public libraries is traced from the mid-nineteenth century to the present, and it is argued that the  move from &quot;knowledge&quot; to &quot;information&quot; has been promoted by the business sector because substantial gains have been realized as a result of capitalizing on knowledge. This move from knowledge to information is seen as a threat to public institutions, particularly to public schools and libraries. In conclusion, it is argued that management policies of non-profit institutions and for-profit institutions should be different since technocratic systems are usually measured by tests of efficiency and effectiveness, whereas libraries should be concerned with accountability and legitimacy as they focus on the labor-intensive process of the inculcation of knowledge.

This report highlights the International Project, the commission's initial pilot project which began in June of 1988 and consists of an exploratory study with the national libraries of Great Britain, France, West Germany, East Germany, Austria, and Venezuela to determine the extent to which preservation records exist in each country; to identify the difficulties of converting those  records to machine-readable form and of entering them into a common database; to decide on the level of bibliographic detail needed to exchange records easily; and to determine the best way to proceed in creating a shared database capacity.

A detailed discussion and assessment of each of the databases is also provided. &quot;Laborlaw I,&quot; a comprehensive index and abstracting service for all U.S. federal and state court and administrative agency decisions pertaining to labor relations, is characterized as being a specialist's database. It is argued that the pervasive use of legal phraseology, extensive abbreviations, technical nature of the material indexed, and the complex file structure of  this database make it most suitable for use in legal or academic libraries. &quot;Legal Resource Index,&quot; a database that provides cover-to-cover indexing of 750 law reviews and bar association journals, law newspapers, and selective law-related articles appearing in standard magazine indexes, is assessed as being appropriate for the end-user as well as the information specialist. However, it is suggested that an &quot;intended audience&quot; field would be a useful addition, allowing the layperson or practitioner to refine search results at a desired level. (SD)",

People's Libraries are defined as facilities that proactively provide information as well as physical space to assist people in decision making and self-development. It is noted that most libraries that currently fall under that definition are not part of official library and information services. This paper includes a discussion of two potential objectives of People's Libraries: to support labor movements, alternative education programs, and adult education  and, in the Post-Apartheid Era, to support and promote reeducation programs on a nationwide scale. It is proposed that services would include storage and dissemination of information in all formats and information referral, and People's Library personnel would be: (1) politically aware, (2) educationalists, (3) managers, (4) organizers, (5) information experts, and (6) willing to perform their jobs for relatively low remuneration or on a voluntary basis.

Criteria mentioned for the selection of materials to be preserved include the rarity, uniqueness, and special features of the item, such as illustrations, photographs, and/or typography, and the feasibility and cost effectiveness of available technologies. It is noted that the preservation problem is most pressing in the arts and humanities, and that the choices of what to preserve or conserve are the most difficult in these areas. It is concluded that, although the future characteristics of a national preservation program are unclear, it is clear that scholars and librarians must become more involved in the process; it must be explained to a generally sympathetic public and legislature; and ways of doing the job better must be developed.

        "description":"In 1989, a study was conducted at the University of West Florida (UWF) to explore the success rate of Associate of Science (AS) and Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree recipients at the college. Although the AS and AAS degrees were originally designed as terminal degrees leading to immediate employment, recipients today are discovering that baccalaureate degrees are required for many entry-level positions as well as for career advancement. In the early 1970's UWF began admitting AS degree recipients in selected fields by special permission of department chairpersons, and later permitted direct access to any program without special approval. By 1984-85, UWF had 206 AS degree holders registered; only two other state universities in Florida enrolled more. Using enrollment and  graduation statistics on students admitted to UWF in fall 1983 with AS or AAS degrees, the study revealed that: (1) out of the 86 AS/AAS students entering in fall 1983, only 17 had graduated by the end of fall 1985; (2) by summer 1988, however, 48% of the AS/AAS students had graduated, compared to 67% of the associate of arts (AA) degree transfer students; (3) of the AS/AAS students who did not graduate from UWF, 8% left the college on academic suspension; and (4) the proportions of AS/AAS and AA students who were on suspension were comparable, as were the proportions of those who left UWE in good academic standing. Based on study findings, it was suggested that colleges and universities consider AS/AAS degree holders in enrollment plans and that these students be studied further to  determine services that could increase their graduation rates.

The study involved a number of components, including: (1) a review of the literature on developmental education and basic mathematics programs; (2) a survey of all California community colleges to determine the instructional practices used by faculty in basic mathematics or pre-algebra programs; (3) a review of community college catalogs to determine the organizational structure of the basic mathematics programs throughout the state; (4) a comparison of the characteristics of students enrolled in basic mathematics and those enrolled in beginning or intermediate algebra; and  (5) a Delphi exercise, involving members of the Saddleback College mathematics faculty, conducted to develop specific recommendations regarding program objectives, organization, and support services for the existing mathematics program. Results of the study led to several conclusions. In light of the diversity of the students enrolled in basic mathematics courses, a variety of instructional styles are warranted, including self-paced instruction, computer-assisted instruction, and faculty and peer tutoring. The focus of the program should be to prepare students for success in algebra. This can best be accomplished by offering two versions of the Arithmetic/Introduction to Algebra course, one focusing on the arithmetic of whole numbers and decimals, the other focusing on the arithmetic of  fractions, and both covering traditional arithmetic topics and simple linear equations. In either class, students would have access to a structured self-paced environment and an optional mathematics tutorial laboratory. Delphi exercise results are appended. (JMC)",

        "description":"Community services and continuing education (CS/CE) has been an integral component of the mission of the comprehensive community college for over a generation. In 1968, the Kellogg Foundation funded a 3-year project designed to insure that CS/CE would achieve its rightful place in the mission of America's community colleges. A component of the Kellogg project was a series of national workshops conducted by the Leadership Program at Michigan State University. The purpose of the workshops was to promote research on the current status of CS/CE programming. One result was a 1971 study which assessed the degree to which CS/CE had diffused into community college programs of Michigan's 29 public community colleges. The findings of the study suggested that CS/CE was in a developmental  stage in Michigan. Community support and publicity elements were present to a high degree, but long-range planning, integration, research/evaluation, and development were much less extensive. The study concluded that CS/CE was the outreach dimension of the community college, involving the organization and integration of the community as well as the resources of the college. CS/CE is still part of the collegiate function to the extent that it is verifiably educative and socially useful. Each college should define CS/CE with particular reference to the needs of its community and CS/CE directors must become involved in planning for development and expansion. Throughout the past two decades, the concept of community has remained central to the development of CS/CE, and the same variables have  continued to influence the growth and development of both concept and program.

        "description":"Several institutions, including churches, community groups, and political organizations, lay claim to the task of bolstering existing values and restructuring the ethical set of the nation. The higher education community has an equally legitimate claim for the responsibility of inculcating values. The role of education in values transference is not new, and each time society experiences a moral malaise, discussion begins anew. Throughout the 1980's, educational writers have stressed that a carefully selected curriculum not only teaches about intellectual values, but also nurtures them. Instructors dealing with ethical issues in their disciplines have been urged to discuss the art of commitment in a pluralistic and uncertain context. Toleration for ability and willingness to act  decisively when faced with uncertainty have been represented as a type of civic literacy. With values, ethics, and a moral point of view considered essential to quality of life, colleges were perceived as having potential civic functions which no other single institution can provide. Writers supported the contention that the development of civic literacy is a legitimate role for America's higher education community. Colleges were urged to forget their institutional egos and become involved in social needs and concerns, and students voiced concern with the consequences of unethical behavior and the effect of organizational structures and leadership on the prevention of misconduct. Though many community colleges have long been involved in programs and projects designed to improve the  economic and social quality of life in their communities, few complete models exist for fostering civic literacy. One example, at Hagerstown Junior College, in Maryland, uses a colloquium approach to analyze such diverse topics as social change, leadership, and the new corporate system. In fall 1988, over 100 faculty, students, administrators, and community members met to discuss the state of ethics in the professions. (JMC)",

        "description":"For millions of students, two-year college education represents the last real opportunity to develop an interest in science, mathematics, or engineering and to develop the prerequisite skills for a career in these fields. Yet, two-year college students represent a largely untapped pool of scientific personnel. Two-year college science and engineering programs share the same problems faced by four-year institutions. Retention is poor, with many students losing interest and switching majors and others being frustrated by the lack of preparation needed for success in science and mathematics courses. Only 20% of the community college students who enroll in a given science, mathematics, or engineering course plan to pursue a bachelor's degree in those areas. The reversal of this trend  requires colleges to provide challenging, stimulating prerequisite or support courses, and the faculty to motivate students to continue their study. In addition, problems faced by faculty, including heavy teaching loads, isolation, the inability to keep current in their disciplines, and burnout, must be alleviated. Many of these problems have resulted from the abandonment of the classical notion of the scholar-professor and the resulting insulation of the craft of teaching from the scholarship that nourishes it. Faculty need this opportunity to be active and to explore current thinking in the disciplines they have chosen if their professional growth is to continue and they are to avoid burnout. At Montgomery College in Maryland, this challenge has been addressed through a scholarly  activities program which allows faculty reassigned time to pursue such activities as writing a paper, participating in a performing arts activity, completing an artistic work, or creating a bibliography of current works in their field. The excellent community college should reward good teaching, and good teaching should show evidence of current and active scholarship. (JMC)",

        "description":"In the 1980's, changes occurring in the American economy stimulated interest in collaboration between vocational education and the private sector. Several studies collected data from educational institutions and employers to identify motives for participating in collaborative arrangements. A 1988 study found that businesses seek cooperative relationships with higher education to obtain expert advice from faculty, gain access to qualified graduates, upgrade the training of employees, and take advantage of federally sponsored research, while educational institutions sought to improve their financial situations and the quality of instruction and research. A 1989 study revealed that: (1) slightly more than one-third of all employers surveyed were actively involved with postsecondary  occupational education; (2) the most common modes of involvement were recruitment of employees, advisory committee memberships, and cooperative programs or internships; (3) incentives for participation were the ability to identify a source of potential employees, provide expertise on the education and training process, and improve the productivity of current employees; and (4) while employers indicated that the inflexibility of postsecondary institutions, their perceived disinterest in employers' advice, and time constraints were major barriers to involvement, educational institutions felt that \"image\" was a major barrier to involvement. Such findings suggest that vocational education institutions should: be aware of the specific needs of the economy; establish alumni committees to  solicit information from former students with job market experience; use advisory committees to form bridges to employers; form planning commissions to promote constructive dialogue among public and private sector employees, unions, and educational organizations; and implement carefully structured internship programs.

Under the program, students are invited to register for courses after: they have been identified by a high school counselor, SCCC's president has contacted their parents regarding the program, an orientation session for interested parents and students is completed, and the applications and recommendations are submitted. In fall 1987, 142 students from eight high schools enrolled in 34 different courses at SCCC, with  nine students enrolling in more than one course. While 54% of the students performed at a C level or higher, one-third either withdrew or did not come to classes. In spring 1988, 99 students, including 33 continuing students, enrolled at SCCC. Most of the students who did not return for the second semester of the program indicated that other responsibilities had become too great, that they could not work and go to school at the same time, or that they had achieved their academic goals. In fall 1988, the program enrolled 144 students, including 12 returning students. While at least 75% of the participants were female each term, the ethnic distribution of the participants shifted radically from semester to semester. In fall 1988, nine of the students who participated in the program during  fall 1987 and/or spring 1988 were enrolled as either full- or part-time degree-seeking students at SCCC.

Prior communication with minority business development organizations revealed that minority businesses had an interest in exporting, but lacked the information and specialized skills necessary to develop an international business strategy. In response to these needs, a series of four workshops was conducted, focusing on assessment of export potential, use of public and private sector resources, export marketing plans,  international market analysis, the fundamentals of distribution, and payment and financing methods for international sales. Another aspect of the program was the opportunity for participants to receive individual consultation from international business specialists as needed. Participants in the program were given information about Harold Washington College's Business and International Education Program and about the services and programs of other business development and international trade organizations. The use of promotional and referral services other than those available within the City Colleges of Chicago was a significant factor in the success of the program. Appendixes contain a workshop program, recruitment letters, a list of participants, workshop evaluation forms and comments,  consultation session evaluations, and a case study of a minority entrepreneur in the telecommunications industry.

        "description":"This description of the Computer-Managed and Aided Instruction (CMAI) Project includes a summary of a December 1989 CMAI planning meeting, the text of a paper presented at the meeting, and descriptions of each of the five phases of the project. The paper, &quot;Programming the Future,&quot; by Gerald C. Angove and Scott Smith, discusses: (1) the far-reaching impact of microcomputers and innovative software on industry, the workforce, and education; (2) the need for more highly skilled, knowledgeable workers in the American education system; (3) the need for a partnership between industry and education to transform the single-skilled worker into a multi-skilled worker; (4) a training partnership developed between Pacific Bell and Sierra Community College, and the resulting benefits to both  parties; (5) the challenge to train a new generation of workers and retrain 80% of today's workforce in the next 5 years; and (6) the need for industry to provide resources to enable educators to be better prepared for the training and retraining challenge. The five phases of Sierra Community College's CMAI project are described next. Phase I involved the identification and evaluation of computer programs available in all vocational trades, the publication of a catalog of software, the identification of additional software requirements, the development of software to supplement existing packages, and a series of teacher workshops focusing on results. Phase II of the project was devoted to updating software, evaluating programs not assessed in phase I, and strengthening the evaluation  instruments. During phase III, the need to update software evaluations became more apparent and, as a result, the CMAI workshops focused on informing instructors about the changes in software programs that would affect their curricula. A significant accomplishment of phase IV was the redesigning, updating, and strengthening of the general, construction, computer-aided design, and electronics evaluation instruments. The objectives of phase V included the development of a library of evaluated computer software, the evaluation of new software, and the inclusion of electronic publishing technology in the software evaluations.

The EOP&amp;S project is a state-funded program that emphasizes individual tutoring, guidance, learning centers, and other support services in order to increase recruitment and retention rates among low-income/disadvantaged students. The studies compared representative samples of EOP&amp;S and non-EOP&amp;S freshmen entering FCC in 1979-80 and 1980-81. Both studies gathered data on students' gender, marital status, ethnicity, age, high school status and grade point average (GPA), GPA and units completed at FCC, degree earned, and number requesting transcripts. Study findings included the following: (1) EOP&amp;S  students tended to have more females than males, while the non-EOP&amp;S groups were predominately male; (2) among the 1979-80 and 1980-81 freshmen, total minority percentages in the EOP&amp;S groups were 84% and 89%, respectively, while in the non-EOP&amp;S groups, minority enrollments were 39% and 31%; (3) 85% of the 1980-81 EOP&amp;S students were high school graduates compared to 45% of the non-EOP&amp;S students; (4) the numbers of FCC graduates were approximately equal for EOP&amp;S and non-EOP&amp;S students in both years; (5) EOP&amp;S students had lower high school GPA's than non-EOP&amp;S students, but final FCC GPA's were almost identical for both groups in both years; and (6) EOP&amp;S and non-EOP&amp;S students were comparable in terms of total number of FCC units completed.

The survey solicited information on students' major, sex, age, race, citizenship, veteran status, transportation, residence, highest degree obtained, college choice, educational goal, course load, previous CCSF attendance, educational plans, employment status, intended use of student services, rating of instruction, and family income. Of the 59,293 students enrolled in the SFCCD in fall 1988, 25,657 were enrolled in credit programs at CCSF and 33,636 were enrolled in non-credit courses and programs at CCC. Study  findings about these students included the following: (1) for every 100 male students in the SFCCD, there were about 135 female students; (2) 4.8% of the students identified themselves as gay or lesbian; (3) the typical district student was 30 years old, with 57% between the ages of 21 and 44; (4) 73% of the students were members of an ethnic minority, including 30.7% Chinese, 16.5% Hispanic, and 8.2% Black; (5) 12.2% of the students already had a baccalaureate degree or higher, and an additional 7.1% had a community college degree; (6) 21.1% listed transferring to a four-year school as an educational goal, while 17.7 wanted to learn or improve their English language skills and 20.2% attended out of personal interest; (7) 36% worked full-time; (8) the median household income was $13,300,  and 25% of all district students had household incomes of less than $5,000; and (9) program planning, job placement, and career counseling were the most desired student services, though one in three CCC students did not feel that they needed any special student services.

Introductory sections explain the reasons that the California Association of Community Colleges decided to distribute the discussion paper to its membership, review the legislative mandate for the development of an accountability system, and explain the purposes of the paper. Next, an analysis of the accountability systems of other states discusses state-imposed measures in Florida and Tennessee,  state-imposed standards with some measures determined by individual colleges in New Jersey, and state-established accountability categories with institutions determining the measures in Virginia and Colorado. This section also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of various methods used to assess institutional accountability, including student tracking, standardized tests, student self-reports, and factual measures. The next section proposes an accountability approach for California, including: (1) a discussion of the guiding principles of the model; (2) a chart listing methods for measuring the attainment of specific outcomes desired at the state level (e.g., diversity, fiscal stability, and effective programs; and (3) an outline of institutional accountability measures to be used  for internal evaluation of the college.

Chapter I provides a rationale for continuing education and outlines the stages of professional development. This section also provides an overview of the five stages in the design and implementation of an IPDP: (1) the individual should consult his/her supervisor to identify any specific areas or job responsibilities that need to be strengthened; (2) the individual should complete the IPDP Form, stating the long- and short-range goals, the anticipated completion date, and  costs; (3) the completed form should be submitted to the person's immediate supervisor for further consultation and approval; (4) once approved at the supervisory level, the plan is reviewed by the Professional Development Committee, which approves funding; (5) once the IPDP has been carried out, a conference is held between the individual and his/her supervisor to evaluate the success of the development plan; and (6) a summary report of the conference is placed in the individual's personnel file. Chapters II, III, and IV present specific IPDP guidelines for faculty, professional support staff, and classified staff. Each of the chapters sets forth the purpose of the IPDP program, outlines the steps in plan development, and explains the procedures for submitting IPDP's for approval and  funding. In addition, provisions for sabbatical leaves are explained for faculty and professional staff. A copy of the IPDP form and information on the Professional Development Committee are appended. (JMC)",

        "description":"In 1989, a two-year study was completed comparing the academic progress of community college transfers, senior college transfers, and continuing juniors (natives) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). The study samples were comprised of 673 former community college students and 393 senior college transfers who entered UIUC in fall 1989, and the comparison group of 4,850 natives who were continuing juniors in fall 1986. Student records for fall and spring terms from 1986 to 1988 provided data on academic achievement, as measured by mean UIUC grade point average (GPA), academic status, and continuing enrollment and graduation through four terms after transfer. Highlights of the findings include: (1) community college students entered UIUC with a pre-transfer GPA  of 4.28, which is slightly higher than the 4.20 of four-year college transfer group and the previous GPA of 3.99 of native students; (2) neither community college or four-year transfers exceeded or equaled their pre-transfer GPA's during the four terms included in this study, while the natives exceeded their prior GPA's for three of the four terms; (3) 80% of the community college transfers and 83% of the four-year college transfers had graduated or remained enrolled after two years, while the comparable figure for the natives was 93%; (4) 41% of the community college transfers and 42% of the four-year transfers graduated during the two years of the study, as did 71% of the 1986 group of natives; (5) 10% of the community college transfers and 7% of the four-year transfers left UIUC for  academic reasons, and 7% of the community college group and 5% of the four-year group were dropped; and (6) community college transfers achieved a lower GPA than four-year transfers or natives in a majority of the 12 subject areas studied. Interpretations of the findings, policy considerations and, data tables are included. (WJT)",

The project's goals were to help Haitian mothers obtain health services for themselves and their infants and to provide information concerning child care and cognitive stimulation.

Intervention group mothers were visited in their homes by Haitian paraprofessionals every two weeks during the last trimester and biweekly for two years after infants' deliveries. Control mothers were visited in their homes twice before delivery, but no postpartum home intervention was provided.

Data address three aspects of the relationship between Chapter 1 and LM/LEP students: (1) Chapter 1's possible provision of English language services in place of non-Chapter 1 LM/LEP programs; (2) problems in selecting LM/LEP students for Chapter 1 services; and (3) the possible conversion of Chapter 1 compensatory education programs into language acquisition programs when LM/LEP students participate. Data suggest that Chapter 1 does not replace special programs for LM/LEP students in the schools. Most districts report that their Chapter 1 selection policies are the same for English proficient  and LM/LEP students. Eligible populations for Chapter 1 and special LM/LEP programs often overlap, thus complicating the task of determining which students belong in which program. The role of Chapter 1 English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) programs in addressing the needs of LM/LEP students raises questions concerning the extent to which these programs substitute for language assistance services for LM/LEP students that are otherwise required by law. Questions also arise over the degree to which compensatory education needs of LM/LEP students can be met in a Chapter 1 ESL program.

A set of 52 cards with statements regarding kindergarten program components was developed from position statements on appropriate kindergarten curriculum by the National Association for the Education of Young Children, the Association for Childhood Education International, and the Southern Association on Children Under Six. The subjects, 10 kindergarten teachers and 10 principals, ordered the cards from most to least important. Initial comparisons indicated that the two groups arranged the cards in similar ways. McQuitty's Elementary Linkage and  Factor Analysis was used to probe for patterns in the similarity of responses. Analysis showed that three types chose inappropriate statements as \"most appropriate.\" Type A seemed to favor authority in the classroom; Type B considered programmed learning to be important; and Type C placed a high priority on test performance. Types A and B were composed of teachers, and Type C was predominantly composed of principals. Teachers and principals appeared to support a view of appropriate kindergarten components that differed radically from the position of early childhood professional and academic groups. (RH)",

Vygotsky proposed a developmental theory of creativity in which creative imagination develops from children's play activities into a higher mental function that can be consciously regulated through inner speech. In adolescence, a new level of creativity is reached as imagination and thinking in concepts begin to interact. But it is not until adulthood that creativity fully matures. Vygotsky's theory proposes that children learn how to do pretend play through interactions with an adult or more capable peer. Vygotsky specifies that creativity develops from making object substitutions in play. Evidence suggests that, contrary to the  Piaget-derived view that the ludic symbol arises from solitary play, the majority of object substitutions during pretend play of children between 12 and 25 months of age are initiated by the mother. Contemporary research on play should not underestimate the importance of adult-child play interactions for the psychological development of the child. (RH)",

Each year, State Board of Education staff collect data on prekindergarten programs and the children they serve in order to answer four primary questions: (1) What are the characteristics of children served? (2) What are the characteristics of prekindergarten projects in Illinois? (3) How well do children do in prekindergarten and kindergarten? and (4) What factors seem to be related to success of children in prekindergarten? Sections of this report concern state requirements for receipt of grants for prekindergarten programs, evaluation of the state's prekindergarten program, and conclusions. Findings of the  evaluation suggest that the state's program is successful even though relatively few children have participated in it. Children with a second year of prekindergarten program experience performed better in kindergarten readiness tests than children with only one year. Children of involved parents were more successful than those of uninvolved parents. Days of attendance may be related to children's success. Appendices provide the State Board of Education's policy statement on early childhood education, relevant sections of the School code of Illinois, and related tables of data. (RH)",

        "description":"This report on prekindergarten programs in North Carolina in 1988 presents information from the first statewide survey of public school administrators concerning the incorporation of 3- and 4-year-olds into public schools. Superintendents and principals were asked to provide factual data on their districts and schools and to express their opinions about types of programs, desired staffing, adult/child ratios, organization, financing, and the adequacy of existing facilities to accommodate prekindergarten children. The questionnaire was designed to cover issues of most concern to policymakers considering public school-based prekindergarten programs. A strong undercurrent in administrators' comments concerned the fact that many children suffer because their families experience  difficulties in caring for them. It is maintained that prekindergarten programs can be defined as child-focused rescue missions that help inadequately prepared youngsters function in ordinary school programs. Prekindergarten programs can be designed to support families and enhance cooperation between home and school. Schools can be conceptualized as key elements in a family support system that encompasses such outreach activities as prekindergarten programs, parent education, technical assistance to family day care homes, and before- and after-school care.

The ADKP was instituted in Columbus' public schools in January, 1972, to provide a full day of instruction for underachieving kindergarten pupils. In the 1988-89 school year, 18 teachers served in 18 elementary schools that were eligible for Chapter 1. Each provided daily instruction for two groups of 15 pupils each for about 13 hours a week. For evaluation purposes, the ADKP provided 114 days of instruction. Pupils included in the final pretest-posttest analysis attended at least 91.2 of the 114 days. Data were collected in five areas: (1) pupil census; (2) standardized achievement test scores; (3) teacher census; (4) parent involvement; and (5) inservice evaluation. The  overall Normal Curve Equivalent (NCE) gain for the program averaged 17.6 NCE points for the 5.7 month treatment, or 3.1 NCE points for each month of treatment. Based on evaluation results, it was strongly recommended that the ADKP be continued in the 1989-90 school year. Results are discussed and steps for improving program effectiveness are specified. Pupil and teacher census forms, parent involvement survey forms, and general and orientation inservice evaluation forms are appended. (RH)",

Observations and evaluations were made of 149 randomly selected day care centers and family day care homes. The day care and family day care versions of the Child Development Program Evaluation Licensing Scale (CDPE), the Early Childhood Environmental Rating Scale (ECERS), and the Family Day Care Home Rating Scale (FDCRS) were used. Findings indicated a significant difference between not-for-profit and for-profit day care centers. Day care centers scored significantly higher than family day care homes. Program compliance scores, as measured by the CDPE, and program quality, as measured by the ECERS and FDCRS, showed a strong curvilinear  relationship. Rural programs scored significantly higher than urban programs on program quality measures. Although not-for-profit day care programs appeared to be of higher quality than for-profit programs, investigation is needed to determine why this difference in quality does not extend to agency-sponsored homes. Another issue needing further investigation is the drop-off in quality that occurs when centers go from substantial to full compliance with state day care regulations. Over 30 references are cited.

In the evaluations, the number of individuals participating in NET activities was compared to preset goals to assess the degree of program goal attainment. The volume of materials distributed by NET was monitored and compared to that of past years. Participant knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors before and after NET workshops were compared. Users of the NET lending library were asked for feedback, and the collection was updated so as to better meet users' needs. Results of evaluations were examined in a meta-analysis designed to portray overall effectiveness of the NET program in 1989. Findings indicated that participation  in the program far exceeded expectations. The number of materials distributed decreased in comparison to 1988 but remained above that of 1985. Participants' child nutrition knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors were found to have improved. A total of 46 of 52 analyses of NET program effectiveness showed positive outcomes. Four appendixes comprising the bulk of the document consist of reports on program participation for the year under study, workshop performance for participants in the Child Care Food Program and National School Lunch Program, workshop performance for day home sponsors, and the updating of the NET lending library collection.

Experiment 1 investigated the influence of maternal attribution to the neonate of certain behavioral characteristics on maternal behavior in interaction. After videotaped mother-neonate pair interaction, neonates were removed for a nominal examination. Mothers were informed only that their neonates had been either alert or not alert in the exam. Mothers were then videotaped in interaction and afterwards informed that the neonate was now in the opposite state. Another interaction was then videotaped. Findings revealed that mothers of normally alert neonates jiggled and rocked their infants' bodies less than when they received minimal instruction. Mothers' pre- and post-delivery medication level  was related to several behaviors in complex patterns. Experiment 2 compared maternal response patterns that occurred after mothers were instructed to follow gross themes with their neonates. A total of 52 mother and neonate pairs were observed under three videotape instruction conditions. Under &quot;comfort instruction,&quot; mothers held neonates by the torso more, repositioned them less, and jiggled and rocked them more, than under minimal instruction. Race and parity determined maternal behaviors in complex patterns. Findings are discussed in terms of maternal perception of, and attachment to, neonates. (RH)",

        "description":"One recently developed parenting research model hypothesizes that parenting behavior and child adjustment are influenced by a number of divergent variables that operate through the component of the parent's personality that is related to the parenting role. In this model, the level of stress experienced by each parent results from a series of appraisals made by each parent in the context of his or her level of commitment to the parenting role. Parenting stress is viewed as a motivational variable that encourages parents to use parenting support resources available to them. The richness or paucity of resources available naturally plays a key role in the ultimate parenting behavior. A measure of one of the important conceptual variables in the model has been developed: The  Parenting Alliance Inventory (PAI), a self-report measure that focuses on aspects of the marital relationship that bear directly on parenting. Recent research has demonstrated that narrow band personality measures consisting of questions that are directly tied to a specific belief system can predict and define determinants of parenting behaviors. It is believed that the PAI will contribute significantly to the prediction of parenting behaviors because the PAI is based on the recognition that both parents can function well in the parenting role even when they are dissatisfied with the marital relationship.

The survey focused on pressing needs of children and families as seen by city officials, the prominence of these needs in community life, the involvement of city governments in meeting these needs, and barriers to expanded involvement. Key findings include: (1) Child care overshadows all other needs for city children; (2) Substance abuse prevention and education rank second and third; (3) Housing tops the list of needs for many city families; (4) Child and family issues are at least moderatley visible in the public forums of many communities, and are likely to be more prominent in elections, news, and civic agendas  in large cities; (5) Diverse organizations and individuals bring these issues to city halls' attention; (6) City halls are involved in a variety of areas relevant to children; (7) City hall programs work; (8) City halls are most involved in the area of recreational activities; (9) Cities carry out their involvement through a variety of means; (10) Involvement may increase in each of 34 identified areas; and (11) Lack of money is the greatest impediment to increased city involvement in family and children's issues, and overshadows all other problems in the nation's largest cities.

The first section discusses child care as a planning issue and focuses on changes in working patterns of families and in residential neighborhoods. The second section describes components of the child care delivery system, which include resource and referral agencies, in-home care, child care centers, and family day care. The third section focuses on family day care and the way in which planning interests are served by family day care. The fourth section discusses zoning ordinances that concern family day care, particularly, the ways in which zoning can limit family day care, the impact of licensing on zoning, the impact of zoning on licensing, analysis of zoning  issues, and the process of dealing with legitimate problems caused by a family day care home. The final section discusses zoning solutions, including the definition of family day care, treatment by local law, the small and large family day care home, and desirable provisions for nondiscretionary or discretionary permits. Appendixes include the American Planning Association child care policy, lists of child care resource and referral agencies and state licensing agencies, and a sample permit procedure and permit ordinance.

If a preschooler played with a child at least half the time, that child was considered the preschooler's best friend. Observations and teachers' selections of best friend pairs were used to confirm children's verbal interview selections. Children's interviews focused on naming the best friend, the friend's physical characteristics, and the functions of friends. Findings showed that: (1) teachers' reports and classroom and playground observations confirmed that children as young as preschoolers know who their best friends are; (2) more children correctly remembered whom they played with in the classroom than  whom they played with on the playground; (3) children's ability to correctly remember their best friend's hair color, relative height, and age increased with age; and (4) children were consistent in their reasons for having friends. The most common reasons involved play and the fact that they liked their friends. (RH)",

First, Washington State death certificate data for 1979-85 were used to characterize the deaths and identify hazardous situations. Second, death certificates were linked to birth certificates of children born in Washington in an effort to examine the role that birth and family characteristics play in early childhood death. The results indicate that the leading categories of early childhood injury death are motor vehicle accidents, drowning, fires, suffocation, and homicide. A total of 31 percent of the deaths occurred in the home, while 57 percent took place outside the home. Deaths from injury inside the home were particularly prevalent among  children with low birth weights. The most common risk factor identified was the presence of other children in the family. In addition, certain lifestyle habits, such as drinking and smoking, place both parent and child at risk. (RJC)",

The first, the Matthews Youth Test for Health (MYTH, 1980), is an instrument based on the factors of competitiveness-leadership and impatience-aggression. The second is the A-B Rating Scale (ABRS, 1982), a self-assessment measure for children that is based on the factors of restlessness-aggression, eagerness-energy, leadership, and alienation. In addition, the stability of MYTH scores over a 3-year period were measured and a principal component factor analysis of MYTH scores was conducted. Data were obtained in two waves. The first wave assessment involved 283 children in kindergarten to fourth grade at two elementary, one public, and one parochial school who were rated for Type A behavior by classroom teachers using the  MYTH. Second wave data, collected 3 years later at participating first wave schools and a private, secular elementary school, involved 198 of the first wave students. These students rated themselves with the A-B Rating Scale and were assessed by a teacher with the MYTH. Findings showed that: (1) MYTH scores tended to remain stable over a 3-year span; (2) agreement between the two measures was weak; and (3) the two factors of the MYTH were intercorrelated more strongly than the four factors of the ABRS.

A measure of children's daily stress that used neutral wording and focused on negative life events, The Hassles Scale for Children (HSC), was developed. A total of 145 elementary school students in second, fourth, fifth, and sixth grades completed the HSC and questionnaires measuring psychological functioning, physical health, and school behavior. Teachers rated social competence. Data indicated that daily hassles were a better predictor of children's self-rated anxiety than life  events. Teacher's ratings of social competence were negatively related to daily stressors. In addition, social skills as rated by the teacher, were modestly related to daily hassles. When the relationship between life events and daily hassles was examined, results indicated that as the child experienced a life event, daily hassles increased. No significant relationship was found between life events and intensity of hassles. (RH)",

An introduction and a brief section on definitions is followed by a discussion of early (pre-school) self-concept development. The topic of schooling and self-concept development is then discussed in terms of the impact of school variables and self-concept enhancement strategies on student self-concept. A discussion of the teacher's role in self-concept enhancement follows, focused on diagnosis of student self-concept and the planning of intervention strategies. It is concluded that the impact of schools in general and teachers in particular on the self-images  of youth can be negative, but that concerted efforts to bring about positive changes frequently succeed. In addition, future research should respond (1) to the need for more action research to identify effective change strategies and (2) to the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the construct of self-concept. Such an understanding would be particularly concerned with the way in which self-concept develops, what influences it, how it changes, and how the changes can be measured.

Social competence was measured by peer liking and disliking nominations and the Teacher Rating of Social Skills (TRSS) scales. Subjects were 127 elementary school students from third though seventh grades. Findings indicated that MYTH scores correlated significantly and negatively with TRSS scores, whereas ABRS  scores did not. The correlation between TRSS scores and the MYTH impatience-aggression factor was negative, whereas the correlation between TRSS and the MYTH leadership-competitiveness factor was positive. Findings suggest that children's Type A behavior pattern may be composed of elements that both encourage and discourage the formation of social support.

Assumptions contributing to negative ideas about the single child include the notions of the deprivation of positive sibling influences and of debilitating, anxiety-ridden parenting by mothers and fathers of firstborns. Research findings in this area are confounded by a lack of coherent theories, heterogeneous sample selection, poor quality of research designs, and problems confronting new research methodology, such as meta-analysis. Conceptual synthesis is needed to bring this chaotic situation to order. This paper: (1) stresses a need to integrate the effects of significant others with existing theories; (2) underscores the need  to assess critical factors affecting the nature and quality of parent-children interaction; (3) suggests that major aspects of school performance and adjustment be considered in the process of detecting the growth and modification of children's personalities; (4) emphasizes the necessity of controlling extraneous factors that contaminate current research; and (5) points to the priority of conducting large-sample studies in single socio-cultural settings before cross-cultural comparisons are made.

The reading and mathematics programs served 14,158 students in 1985-86 and 14,280 in 1986-87. Data regarding reading indicated that mean normal curve equivalent (NCE) gains greater than zero were found in all districts and grade levels for both school years. Elementary school students (grades 1-6) tended to have greater reading achievement gains than secondary school students (grades 7-12). Statewide mean NCE reading achievement gain scores for 1985-86 and 1986-87 were 8.6 and 8.4, respectively. A total of 74 percent of students had NCE gain scores greater than zero in the 1985-86 school year, and 73 percent had such gains in the 1986-87 year. A greater proportion of elementary  school students than of secondary school students made positive NCE gains for the 2-year period. Regarding statewide mathematics, the mean NCE gains were 8.2 in 1985-86 and 10.6 in 1986-87. Elementary students tended to have greater achievement gains than secondary students. For the 1985-86 and 1986-87 school years, 71 percent and 79 percent of Chapter 1 mathematics students had NCE gains greater than zero. Except for Windward school district, a greater proportion of elementary school (grades 2-6) students than of secondary school students made positive NCE gains for the 2-year period. It is concluded that Hawaii's Chapter 1 Program has had a positive impact on students. (RH)",

        "description":"In a demonstration of the Appalachia Educational Laboratory's (AEL's) Community Partnership for School Improvement model, Hart County (Kentucky) community members and school representatives planned and implemented a school improvement project to increase parents' involvement in their children's education. In May 1988, 203 out of 625 questionnaires were completed by randomly selected parents of children in Hart County's six schools. The 30-item questionnaire measured aspects of parent involvement: meeting basic needs, activities at home and school, communications, and involvement in school decision making. Project activities during the 1988-89 school year included a 1-day workshop on parent involvement attended by school staff, 6 school-wide plans, 37 teacher projects aimed at  increasing parent involvement, and acquisition of videotapes on parenting for use with parents. A second administration of the questionnaire, completed by 209 of the 625 randomly selected parents at the end of the school year, showed a significant overall increase in parent involvement. The greatest improvement concerned communications by teachers and principals with parents, and involvement by principals of parents in decision making. Scores did not improve in the area of schools helping parents meet their children's basic needs. Although no individual school showed a significant improvement in average total score, 68% of the observed differences in items were in the positive direction. AEL gives three recommendations for building on the success of the 1988-89 project. This report  includes nine statistical tables. Appendices contain the instrument used in this study and a revised version for future use. (SV)",

          "And Others"],
        "description":"This monograph examines four plans for state funding of educational facilities: total control; 50-50 flat grants; full state funding; and equalization. The trend in many states is to become increasingly more involved in helping local school districts with capital outlay for facility requirements. Recent litigation suggests that capital outlay is an emerging issue that will be addressed in the courts if it is not effectively addressed by state policy. Twenty-eight states currently provide some form of true assistance. The result is a greater degree of equity, enhanced educational opportunity, and reduced vulnerability to legal challenges. Policymakers need to understand their options, and they need methods to assess them in the context of political economy, legislative climate,  demography, and patterns of school organization. The four plans examined in this document are evaluated for their effects on adequacy and equity in the context of two models--the average practice model and the estimated needs model, each applied to data from Kansas schools. The goal within the first model is to enable every district to fund facilities at an average level. The goal in the second model is full funding of needs estimated by districts. The discussion draws a number of implications about the adequacy and equity of school financing, urban-rural differences in financing, and systematic improvements. Recommendations to state policymakers address increased local control; funds for debt service and new projects; and funds to meet special needs, growth, and the exigencies of  sparsity. (TES)",

The first section describes various state formulas and the methods used to distribute funds to rural schools. It considers questions about the adequacy of funding adjustments based on sparsity and the relationship of such adjustments to equal educational opportunity. It also synthesizes the current research on the status of school facilities. This section of the discussion details the relationships among wealth, ability to pay, and the maintenance and capital expenditure problems that rural, small (and usually poor) school districts face. The second section describes some of the legal challenges relevant to rural and small schools currently before the courts. At the heart of these challenges is  the inability of existing finance formulas to address adequately the needs of rural education. These challenges are compared to similar challenges brought by urban schools. The third section discusses state and local support mechanisms and details efforts by some states to make the tax base more responsive to rural education needs. It considers issues involved in reclassification and reassessment of property, including relevant economic concerns of primarily agriculture-based economies. Conclusions and recommendations include discussions about consolidation and school reform as related to equal educational opportunity. (Author/TES)",

        "description":"This brief retrospective outlines major points in the history of American Indian education and major issues in Indian curriculum and teacher training. From the arrival of Europeans until recent times, formal schooling for American Indians has been controlled by others--first missionaries, then the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). After World War II, American Indians began to actively promote self-determination and their own civil rights. Today all Indian schools are controlled by the local community or are operated by the BIA in conjunction with local Indian school boards. American Indian students' generally poor academic achievement has been attributed to sociocultural factors, such as differences between students' and teachers' languages, cultures, values, and learning styles.  School improvement efforts either are based on studies of urban or suburban schools serving the dominant culture or follow the &quot;whole language approach,&quot; focusing on getting students to read more &quot;real literature&quot; and to write more. Integration of American Indian language and culture into the regular school curriculum is critical to improving student achievement. Teachers of Indian children need systematic training about sociocultural influences on learning and about tribal cultures. Some tribal councils have formulated educational policies that mandate school instruction in the tribal language and culture. This digest contains 10 references. (SV)",

        "description":"This document reviews problems related to sexual activity among rural U.S. teenagers, successes and failures of teen sex education programs, and problems and needs specific to rural areas. In a recent poll, 89% of adults favored sex education in the schools and 73% supported making birth control information and contraceptives available in school clinics. The likelihood of a teenager becoming sexually active has less to do with socioeconomic status than with individual teens' values, goals, aspirations, and family environment in which he or she is raised. The primary causes of teens' contracting the HIV virus are ignorance, depression, being from a dysfunctional family, and poor school performance. Few sex education curricula address males and none describes strategies for using  rural delivery systems. Successful teenage sexuality programs should deal comprehensively with the issues, last long enough to effect change, and involve students in the learning process. By itself, sex education is not a deterrent to teenage sex. The popular media encourage sexual activity and seldom address its accompanying responsibilities. Classroom programs must be supplemented by community-based efforts. Rural teens are as sexually active as their urban counterparts, but rural areas are less likely to offer HIV education to students. The prevalence of high-risk students in rural areas is high while resources are scarce. The need for effective programs to delay sexual activity and educate teens regarding the HIV virus has never been greater. Community approaches might be assisted by  unique rural resources such as a tradition of neighbors helping neighbors and coperative extension services. (TES)",

        "description":"Recruitment and retention of special education teachers and related services staff have been persistent problems of rural school districts nationwide. High teacher attrition rates have serious ramifications for personnel development and program stability. Effective recruitment strategies for rural areas have four main components: (1) emphasis on qualities of rural schools and communities that reinforce intrinsic motivations and meet teachers' social, self-esteem, and self-actualization needs; (2) appeal to persons with lifestyles, interests, and attitudes consistent with local cultural norms; (3) use of individualized \"hot buttons,\" such as advertising the rural lifestyle as an escape from urban problems or using the \"Peace Corps\" approach; and (4) \"selling\" the school district  through creative marketing techniques. Teachers who stay in a rural area typically have goals, mores, expectations, and lifestyles similar to those of local residents. Thus, the school district must develop means of helping new staff to acclimate. Teacher orientation could involve pairing with an experienced teacher or with another staff person who has successfully relocated. Other effective retention strategies are:. (1) involving newcomers in community-related activities; (2) faculty exchange programs; (3) inservice incentive systems; (4) special challenges or assignments; (5) merit increases or other approaches to recognize extraordinary performance; and (6) stress reduction activities. Regional interagency systems for recruiting and retaining rural educators are needed to provide  educational forecasting and needs assessment, communication networking, and links to universities.

Strategies to develop support for special education programs among regular education personnel and in the community employ integrative activities in school and community and effective use of communication networks and informal organizational structures. Strategies to enhance instruction cover teacher cooperation and consultation, innovative variations on placement in the least restrictive environment, provision of special services on a  voluntary basis where space is available, and vocational programming and placement in the community. Strategies for transporting students or service providers include integrating special education with regular education transportation, sharing transportation services with other agencies, using volunteers, clustering students for cost efficiency, using travel time for instruction, and using technology to provide distance education. Strategies to supplement inadequate numbers of special education staff employ role changes, staff sharing, and professional and nonprofessional volunteers.

The primary assessment was conducted by analyzing video tapes of individual students and pairs of students working on multi-step problems and non-standard problems, and subsequently being interviewed about their performance. The interview probed the students' mathematical knowledge, strategies, decisions, beliefs, and affects. A variety of written protocol data, including pre- and post-tests, homework assignments, and in-class assignments were collected. The instruction was presented by one of the  investigators to a regular-level and an advanced-level 7th-grade class about 3 days per week for a period of 12 weeks. Among the four categories of the cognitive-metacognitive framework, which included orientation, organization, execution, and verification, the orientation category had the most important effect on students' problem-solving. Finally, it appeared that instruction was most likely to be effective when it occurs over a prolonged period of time and within the context of regular day-to-day mathematics instruction.

        "description":"This paper presents four Italian educational theories and defines their basic doctrines with regard to society and their relationship to education. The first theory, called the laicist-liberal theory, merges the idealist tradition with the theory of liberalism in social development, while it stresses the importance of the individual and social growth nurtured by social culture. In this theory education fosters social culture through humanistic, scientific, and technical education. The socialist-marxist theory, the second theory, promotes the idea of man as an historical and social being, and its basic concepts include the ideas that: (1) values are derived from the progressive experience of man; (2) civic education aims at educating citizens to cooperate in communities; and (3)  political education is an essential part of civic education. This theory calls for the removal of the authoritarian and bureaucratic structure of schools and for the establishment of the democratization of education. The principles behind the third theory, the Catholic theory, are that the human being has the highest value of all existing things and that the human being is essentially social and political. Civic education must be used to direct the social and political human being through democratic value clarification. The radical theory, the fourth theory, views pacificism and tolerance as essential values in starting social change. This theory stresses history instruction and advocates school intervention and participation in the community. (DJC)",

        "description":"Two major efforts to redirect the school curriculum that are currently of special concern, not only to educators but to the general citizenry as well, are citizenship education and international or global education. Both deal with the development of competent and responsible citizens whose perspectives, knowledge, and skills will enable them to participate more effectively in local, state, national, and international affairs. Scholars have called for a new, less ethnocentric vision of U.S. history designed to provide a world-historical perspective, a perspective that will cultivate a sense of individual identification with the triumphs and tribulations of humanity as a whole. Due to the role which the United States plays in world affairs, U.S. citizenship is a passport to  relevance in world affairs. This call for an expanded view of citizenship education is echoed by professional societies and the National Governors Association. There is, however, debate on the goals and contents of such programs. Some argue that the turning away from a U.S.-centered view promotes a cultural relativism that denies the import and unique value of the U.S. experience and way of life. Another implication of cultural relativism is the equation of all systems as humane or legitimate, when in fact they may not be. The variety of proposals for the content and scope of international education programs reflects the variety of rationales for the need of international education, as well as the fact that no intellectual heritage exists in this area. Good citizenship in today's  interdependent world requires a broad, transnational outlook and a greater concern for the human rights of all the world's peoples. (PPB)",

        "description":"It is commonplace to lament the lack of knowledge about world issues and events exhibited by U.S. citizens. Communication scholars criticize the mass media's poor coverage of world affairs and stereotypic portrayals of distant lands and leaders. Despite sophisticated communications networks, U.S. mass media provide only a limited window on the world, and the view outside is fragmented, partial and prejudicial. Surveys have repeatedly revealed the global illiteracy of U.S. citizens and their fear or hostility to foreign governments and ideas. While the diversity of media seems to encourage political debate and the public's involvement, the corporatized, homogenized newspaper chains seem to aim for the lowest common denominator of public intelligence and political discourse. It is  precisely the consumption of trivialized news stories and fragmented fictions that overload viewers, confuse media consumers, and often narcotize rather than energize. The concept of news favors personality over issue, event over content, and official positions over popular grievances. The classical theory of liberal democracy is that media will enable people to develop informed opinions that will be translated into the nation's political will. Educators have a challenge to reveal that mass media news is a cleverly contrived social construction. The monopoly ownership of the public information channels must be democratized. Cultural exchange and cross-national dialogue should be encouraged. U.S. citizens must realize that their lives are ultimately affected by international issues that  are not being reported on the networks. A list of 14 references is included. (PPB)",

        "author":["Brumberg, Stephan F."],
        "description":"For the United States, fighting World War I involved not only preparing young citizens to fight the enemy abroad, but rooting out alien enemies at home. The national consensus, believed vital to success, presupposed a common set of values, shared behaviors, and a high degree of identification with the nation. The more homogeneous the population, the more likely it would voluntarily and spontaneously coalesce behind a common plan of action. Differences became suspect and a threat to consensus. The desire to aggressively assimilate new immigrants became linked to questions of loyalties and allegiances in wartime. The nation turned to its schools as a way to communicate its policies and generate popular support for the War. It also looked to the schools to counter dissent and to  acculturate immigrants so that they would mesh with the established U.S. community and join the crusade to &quot;make the world safe for democracy.&quot; The urgency of the movement led to direct federal involvement in Americanization programs and related work in immigrant education. This paper examines the federal government initiatives regarding Americanization, as represented by the work of three agencies: (1) the Bureau of Naturalization, (2) the Bureau of Education, and (3) the Committee on Public Information. The activities initiated by each agency are described, with emphasis on how each sought to transmit its program to the local level. An effort is made to assess the effects, if any, of these programs on the U.S. immigrant population. (JB)",

        "description":"Electronic aids can be used to augment the lecturing process and improve students' learning experience when teaching large groups of students at the university level. They can, among other things, stimulate student interest in the material, display the unfolding structure of a lecture, provide students ready access to the instructor's own lecture outlines, and expand opportunities for students to put questions directly to the instructor. This paper reports on the findings of before and after surveys of 400 students' attitudes in two classes of U.S. Government toward four electronic techniques: (1) showing short video clips on events in U.S. politics; (2) projecting topic outlines of lectures on a screen during class; (3) providing students the ability to print full sentence  lecture outlines; and (4) communicating with students via electronic mail. Student surveys taken before and after both courses show that students viewed the four techniques quite positively, often warming to the techniques during the quarter. Students demonstrated an ability to distinguish between the \"best liked\" techniques and those \"most important for learning.\" The sentence outline technique was both the best liked and most important for learning but also contributed to reduced class attendance, which raises questions about its effectiveness. The paper includes graphs of findings and samples of material projected during class or retrieved by students via computer. The before and after surveys used in the study are appended. (JB)",

        "description":"Is sociology a legitimate and worthwhile course of study at the secondary level? Sociology differs from other disciplines in its conceptual and abstract nature. Sociology is about organizations, systems, structures, processes, and relationships. It studies power, conflict, roles, and values. Grasping these abstractions is most difficult at the introductory level. Sociology also lacks unity of perspective. This is exciting for sociologists, but confusing for students. Sociologists for the most part have leaned toward improving social conditions and toward getting involved in social issues and reform movements. They are inclined to exhibit a tolerance for the nonconformists of society. Much of sociological instruction is politicized, and a liberalizing effect has been documented  among students taking introductory sociology. Given these problems, there are multiple alternatives. Sociology could be ignored as a legitimate area of study, or it could be treated as a scientific discipline, but neither of these approaches is very realistic. Sociology must become relevant to students. Schools, through sociological training, can teach research and data analysis skills, can help students think critically about the social world and their place within it, and can help assist in the development of problem-solving skills at both personal and organizational levels.

        "description":"While there has been an increase in the number of women elected to state legislatures, little is known about the impact of gender on state legislation. A longitudinal analysis was conducted of bills proposed by individual legislators in the Arizona State Legislature between 1969 and 1986 to investigate the relationship of gender to public policy output. Women legislators were hypothesized, first, to initiate more bills in traditional women's interest areas than men; second, to initiate more bills on feminist issues than men; and third, to have less success in securing passage for their proposed bills than men. Drawing on Kanter's work in organizations, the proportion of women in the legislature was introduced as a control variable; a minimum of 15 percent was hypothesized to be  necessary for women to function effectively in the legislature. Support was found for the first two hypotheses about women legislators' areas of policy specialization, but only after women held more than 15 percent of the legislative seats. The third hypothesis was not supported, but the reasons varied according to the percentage of seats occupied by women. This study suggests that proportional group size may be an important consideration in the evaluation of the impact of gender on public policy.

        "description":"Those studying the distribution of urban services have generally concluded that services are distributed according to bureaucratic decision rules based on professional and bureaucratic norms such as need, efficiency, economy, equity, and convenience. Interest groups and elected officials may play a central role in effecting changes in bureaucratic decision rules for service delivery, as well as in the adoption of new city services and nonincremental changes in existing services. Therefore, in seeking to advance the feminist agenda on the local level, women's rights groups have worked primarily through bureaucracies, not executives or legislatures. Local women's rights groups have presented their demands in a manner consistent with professional and bureaucratic norms, and also  have worked through policy networks to transform local bureaucracies. This paper examines the process by which the women's agenda for the treatment of rape victims has led to significant change within bureaucracies organized around social welfare, criminal justice, and health care. The study focuses upon a set of urban services that have well-defined constituencies and clientele groups and moves beyond a concern with service delivery to examine redesign decisions via basic changes in the professional norms surrounding these services. It utilizes a model of the policy process based on interest group theory, the concept of a policy network, and explanations of bureaucratic change. Four tables and a 39-item bibliography of references are included. (Author/JB)",

        "description":"Gender neutral public policies are those that are either silent on the question of the existence of significant gender differences or incorporate a perspective which mandates that such differences be ignored. Prominent voices today contend that gender neutrality favors males and have held the male standard as the one for which women should aspire. Others argue that gender neutrality has denied the role of the family in women's lives and ignores the needs of women who reject the feminist movement. Historically, feminism has been of two types: (1) individualist, which ignores gender and makes no attempt to favor the mothering role over any other; and (2) relational, which defines women in terms of childbearing and/or nurturing capacities. One must keep in mind that the apparent  dichotomy is not shaped by innate distinctions in how people think about women's lives or in how women live their lives, but by the manner in which the U.S. public policy system operates, forcing people to choose one or the other side in a fight that is not of feminism's own making. It is the system itself that has been silent on gender. Women have pushed for reforms that have given women rights equal to men and now have been challenged to use that system to provide special treatment so that women can exercise those rights. The equity and equality dichotomy threatens feminism's future cohesiveness. This need not be the case. The social construction of gender is changing, and the feminist movement must take care to guide this change. (JB)",

The Chinese Academy of Sciences (Academia Sinica), a national comprehensive research center was established in 1949 to train qualified scientists and technicians. The China Science and Technology Developmental Plan was promulgated in 1956. By 1962, the major goals of the plan had been accomplished. A second ten-year plan followed. In 1978, the Communist Party gave new directions to the science and technology community, and in 1983, the government apparatus implemented the National Long-Term Plan for Science and Technology, 1986-2000. The objective of this plan is accomplishing the modernization of  agriculture, industry, national defense, and science and technology. The best way to describe the Chinese system for managing science and technology policy and its implementation is that it is a Chinese derivative of the 1950s Soviet managerial system. The State Council is at the top of the hierarchy followed by the Committee for Science and Technology of China, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, research institutions associated with the various ministries and committees, research and technology centers associated with the universities, and local research institutes. As an economically developing country, China must make hard choices as to resource allocations, especially personnel.

Children's literature addresses those interests by exploring people, places, historic times, cultures, and social concerns with appealing stories and illustrations.&quot; (3) &quot;Students like repetition. Important information needs to be repeated if it is to be remembered over a long period of time, perhaps varied methods of repetition.&quot; These quotes are followed by a 66-item annotated bibliography of sources for teaching geography. The items are divided as to geographic  area, and an indication is given as to appropriate student level. The document concludes with a poem by Peter Parley. (JB)",

        "description":"This preliminary report of a research project in progress briefly outlines Zimbabwe's historical, geographic, and cultural heritage and describes the methodology being used. Traditionally, Zimbabwean women are viewed as inferior and subordinate in a patriarchal society. They perform much of the work but have no political power. This study seeks to learn the extent to which developing countries such as Zimbabwe are actually contributing to the empowerment of women since the United Nations declared International Women's Year (1975) and through what channels this empowerment could be observed and even measured. Also of interest are the dynamics of the development process itself and how the strategies of development projects include, exclude, and affect women. Twenty-nine women and  one man in and around Harare, the capital city of Zimbabwe, who were engaged in some development activity with an emphasis on women's issues were interviewed and four groups were identified which serve as the basis of the analysis. Group 1 was composed of the indigenous, rural women who were engaged principally in income generating activities designed to improve their marginal economic status. Group 2 was made up of indigenous, urban women, members of a textile union who met monthly to discuss work-related problems. Group 3 consisted of two women who held the only governmental appointments filled by women. Group 4 was composed of the directors of non-governmental organizations. The ongoing research will attempt to develop evaluative criteria to assess the impact of the four groups on the  development of women in Zimbabwe. (JB)",

Findings indicated that time spent teaching social studies in South Dakota elementary schools was less than national trends. The textbook was the predominant material used in teaching social studies, while supplementary materials used most were maps/globes, audiovisuals, and teacher-prepared materials. Common instructional strategies were discussion, group projects, field trips, and games. Areas that  received extra emphasis in social studies were citizenship at the K-2 grade levels, American Indian education and citizenship at the grade 3-4 levels, and geography at the grade 5-6 levels. Economics received little emphasis at all grade levels. Few elementary schools received the journals &quot;Social Education&quot;, &quot;The Social Studies&quot; or &quot;Social Studies and the Young Learner&quot; as professional growth resources. Principals ranked social studies and science as the least important subject areas in terms of their schools commitment when compared to reading, mathematics, and language arts.

        "description":"The devastation of a nuclear confrontation between the superpowers would clearly change the world in catastrophic ways. The purpose of this study was to identify differences in the value priorities for individuals who spontaneously expressed a concern about nuclear war and those who did not. A written questionnaire was administered to a sample of 5,128 adolescents from grades 6 through 12 in the rural inland Northwest. This questionnaire included the Rokeach Value Survey (RVS) and the Spontaneous Concern about the Nuclear Threat Scale (SCANTS). A total of 24.3 percent of the adolescents expressed concern about nuclear war on the SCANTS and the remaining 75.7 percent did not. Using the Mann-Whitney U statistic, 10 of the 18 value priorities were found to significantly  differentiate the two groups. Adolescents who expressed concern about a nuclear war placed higher priorities on the social values of equality and a world at peace. Adolescents who did not express a concern about nuclear war placed higher priorities on the individual values of health, a comfortable life, self-respect, an exciting life, wisdom, mature love, pleasure, and inner harmony. The results are discussed in terms of belief system theory and theories of social cognition. The document includes one statistical table and an 11-item bibliography. (Author/JB)",

        "description":"Twelve graduate students from a variety of fields who were enrolled in a qualitative research class met in an informal setting that facilitated a collaborative learning mode--defined in this presentation as a method of group interaction whereby all members learn from each other's experiences, scholarship, and skills. The first of the six papers making up this document gives a general introduction to the project. As individuals and as a group, members work on a tangible end product such as a book or a series of articles. The process, however, is perhaps more important than the product. The students chose seven focal topics to guide their meetings: (1) interviewing, (2) writing, (3) politics, (4) ethics, (5) gaining access, (6) participant observation, and (7) data analysis. All  but the first two are discussed by the students. Their thoughts on how the collaborative learning process helped them work through these topics and related them to their own qualitative research are insightful and could be of use to a novice qualitative researcher. Five themes became apparent to the students: (1) learning collaboratively develops camaraderie; (2) learning collaboratively does not eliminate the anxiety associated with doing qualitative research, but it does moderate, redirect, and make use of that anxiety; (3) humor plays a vital role in the collaborative process; (4) the process is evolutionary in nature and takes time; and (5) diversity contributes positvely to collaboration. The five remaining papers were contributed by members of the group and provide varying personal  perspectives on the experience. (JB)",

        "description":"Few U.S. high school students know art or music history, but the languages of the arts should not be foreign to anyone. History should be taught as an exploration of human endeavors and expressions. History provides the framework to help people learn the changing forms, styles, and functions of the arts, religion, philosophy, and other humanistic endeavors. The study of history enhances the study of the arts and vice versa. A curriculum should impose an order that will help students find patterns in the categories and chronologies of the humanities without sacrificing their own emotional, aesthetic, and intellectual responses to each work they encounter. By viewing history as a pattern, as a series of interrelated cycles repeated in a variety of ways, educators help to prepare  students for new experiences and equip them to understand the past and the present and to be ready for the future. Chapter 1 presents a rationale for integrating the arts into secondary education. Chapter 2 discusses teaching students how to respond to the arts through subject, function, and form. Chapter 3 is a case study of an interdisciplinary humanities course for high school seniors taught in Needham High School (Massachusetts). The organization of the course is discussed and sample activities are presented. Chapter 4 discusses student reactions to the course. A 10-item bibliography concludes the document. (JB)",

Students must be taught with a variety of approaches to accommodate various learning styles. Experiential learning--testing theories, creating models, tinkering, expressing ideas visually, aurally, and kinesthetically--reinforces the learner as well as the concepts. And as students share their products with their peers, they learn from each other. It is important for teachers and specialists, curriculum directors and principals to come together to plan the total curriculum from kindergarten through  the elementary grades. Integrated education involves looking at the curriculum as a unified whole rather than as a series of isolated subject areas. Subjects are linked from one discipline to another. The power of the arts as an integrating catalyst is dramatic and compelling. This document offers an instructional framework and shows how an integrated approach can accommodate various learning styles. Case studies and classroom applications are presented to illustrate how the approach works. An 11-item bibliography concludes the document. (JB)",

Participants included classroom teachers, independent education consultants, school administrators, individuals affiliated with universities, and educators affiliated with such institutions as the YMCA, the YWCA, exchange programs, and museums. Two ideas emerged as central to the discussion: (1) the distinction between youth leadership and student leadership, and (2) the understanding of leadership as service performed in the context of a community. Student leadership usually refers to activities that students undertake within their schools or as token representatives of students elsewhere. Youth leadership presumes that young people can engage in effective behavior and exercise  thoughtful influence on the course of human events. Leadership was generally seen as intentional action that influenced the course of events. Most of the participants wanted young people to develop leadership skills that would serve the welfare of their community and the world. Other issues and ideas that were discussed include: (1) vision, (2) world-view, (3) heroes, (4) personal responsibility, (5) student control, (6) risk taking, (7) process, (8) power, (9) systems, (10) competition, (11) reinforcement, (12) maintaining childhood, (13) skills, (14) obstacles, (15) money, and (16) fellowship.

It incorporates the study of racial and ethnic differences, as well as issues related to gender, age, socioeconomic status, and physical disabilities. Its primary goals are to create a sense of understanding and respect for differences, to overcome prejudice and discrimination, to provide an understanding of the dynamics of racism, to replace historical and cultural distortions with accurate information, and to assure that all students receive equitable benefits from the educational system. Global education deals with diversity at the global level. Its primary focus is on those interrelated systems that affect the entire planet. The primary goals of global education are to build understanding and respect  for peoples and nations outside the United States, to transcend the narrow Western-centric bias that pervades much of traditional curriculum, to provide an understanding of the dynamics of imperialism and oppression, to create awareness of the earth as an interrelated and holistic system. The relationship between multicultural and global education is interactive. To understand one's own cultural roots and that others may have very different cultural experience means little until learners have examined the impact this diversity has on the world. And learners need to understand that individual behavior and choices can have global consequences in an interdependent world. Programs from either perspective should not be implemented in isolation from the other. (JB)",

The participants agreed on six assumptions: (1) Schools should value and cherish children. School should be a place where the dignity of the individual is honored and where norms of behavior would allow students to feel safe and free to think critically and speak and act out of personal conviction. (2) Schools should teach students to value democratic principles and practices. (3) Schools should  prepare citizens to make informed decisions and participate effectively in local, state, national, and international communities. This would require that schools teach students thinking skills so they can weigh information and make critical judgments. (4) Schools should teach about others with fairness and evenhandedness. (5) Schools should help students make moral judgments. (6) Both the community and professional educators have unique and complementary roles in designing responsive schools. These six assumptions are discussed, and some of the unresolved issues and remaining questions are enumerated.

Since a pilot study indicated that gender realization was influenced by the historical era in which people are raised, four subjects--two men and two women--from different age levels were selected to be the subjects of in-depth case studies. At the onset of the study, all subjects were preservice students; over the course of the study each progressed to the status of novice teacher. Each had left a successful first career. An analysis of the case studies indicated that for each of these subjects the motivation to become a teacher was rooted in a world view comprised of attitudes and values shaped by the home and school experience of early years,  particularly the relationship they had with their parents and the gender roles that were the outcome of these experiences. Career decisions and career success and satisfaction had been affected by the presence or absence of role models and mentors. Motivational factors included school experiences, parental expectations, attitudes toward education, developmental needs, desire for autonomy and challenge, and feelings of career achievement. The implications of these findings for schools of education are discussed. (JD)",

The expectations and attitudes of 138 beginning teachers participating in the Indiana Beginning Teacher Internship Program were sought before and after participation. Instruments used in the study were the Self-Perception Inventory and Beginning Teachers' Questionnaires. Significant differences were found between beginning teachers' expectations and their actual experiences: there was a growth in the extent to which beginning teachers felt adjusted to their teaching responsibilities and successfully created relationships with mentors. Differences were also found between the beginning and ending attitudes toward education of elementary  teachers: increasingly, more consideration was given to new ideas and a new attitude developed toward the mentors, who no longer were seen as interfering with their professional lives. In the area of self-concept, the teacher scale of above average in both the pre-test and the post-test indicated a pattern of persistence.

Principals were found to be more optimistic concerning the implementation of effective teaching practices, and felt that teacher inability was the major impediment. Teachers felt that lack of time and the characteristics of their students created the greatest impediment to effectiveness. All of the groups felt that the best way to learn effective teaching practices was through actual teaching. The majority of teachers were not familiar with the reform reports from the  Holmes Group or the Carnegie Foundation. The undergraduate education students did not anticipate teaching low SES or low achieving children. However, teachers from the same geographic areas reported that over 50 percent of their students were low or lower middle SES and below average in achievement. The results raise questions concerning teacher efficacy, the nature of the profession, and the recruitment and training of teacher education students. (Author)",

        "description":"Workshops, conferences, clinics, seminars, and training sessions are examples of \"temporary systems,\" in which participants suspend their usual roles and responsibilities and concentrate on a few short-term objectives. One mechanism of a temporary system is the use of feedback to determine the extent to which the project objectives are being achieved and the impact that the project is having on the participants. Typically, two evaluation methodologies are used: (1) formative or process, and (2) summative. This paper describes five evaluation processes that provide an evaluation model for staff development programs. The first model--of a formative and process evaluation--is designed to help in the identification of the type of activities that a staff development director might  plan. Model two illustrates a more summatively oriented instrument for judging which selected preconference mailings, brochures, etc. were perceived to be most helpful to the participant. The third model illustrates an easy to use form after each major presentation. Model four is one example of \"testing\" any selected process element of a workshop or a longitudinal inservice education project. The fifth model provides an opportunity for participants to evaluate their perceptions of the over-all experiences offered by the staff development program. (JD)",

The mechanism for facilitating the mentoring relationship is already in place in the form of the sponsored mentoring relationship of student teaching. The sponsor (university), mentor (master teacher) and protege (student teacher) relationship is an accepted and functional structure on which to build. It is pointed out that the college of education is the appropriate agent to facilitate the induction experience. It can deal best with the process and is most familiar with the proposals for education reform and the needs of novices, mentors, and teacher education institutions.  Novices need encouragement, and experienced teachers need to feel valued and to have opportunities to share their expertise. The college is in a position to take on the role of sponsor in order to facilitate the developmental relationships between mentor and novice. (JD)",

        "description":"In this discussion of whether youth fitness tests should be evaluated with norm-referenced standards or criterion-referenced standards, it is pointed out the the suitability of the test depends upon the purpose for which the test is administered. A high level of physical fitness is linked with health, at least in adults, which suggests that physical fitness testing is done for the purpose of health screening and motivating students. For this purpose, criterion-referenced standards are more suitable. Norm-referenced standards are useful for comparing groups and selecting talented athletes, but do not necessarily link health and fitness. (JD)",

Most of the teachers' intuition- and experience-based responses emphasized bringing shy students along slowly but surely by making them feel comfortable and secure in the classroom, reassuring them of their ability to handle academic challenges, providing special instruction or help if necessary, and applying consistent but gentle and largely indirect pressure for change (in the form of invitations and encouragement rather than demands or direct  confrontations). For withdrawn students, the teachers mentioned direct appeals for improved attention; cueing, shaping, environmental engineering, and other support of assistance in sustaining such attention; and attempts to identify and work on the underlying problems that led such students to become withdrawn in the first place. Within these general trends, the higher rated teachers mentioned a greater range of relevant strategies and expressed greater confidence in their ability to respond effectively to shy or withdrawn students than did the lower rated teachers.

Compared to their responses concerning some of the other problem student types addressed in the Classroom Strategy Study, the teachers were unusually confident about their abilities to intervene successfully with failure syndrome students. They tended to mention similar response strategies featuring a combination of support, encouragement, demands for improved persistence, and task assistance designed to shape better work habits through successive approximations. These stratagies for responding to failure syndrome problems reported by most teachers were  well matched to the strategies supported by the research literature. However, teachers were not familiar with cognitive modeling as a method for teaching students better coping strategies, nor with the importance of teaching them to persist in the face of frustration or failure rather than just programming them for success.

Higher rated teachers exhibited greater confidence and described a greater variety of strategies in more detail, but the lower rated teachers generally spoke along the same themes. The teachers' responses indicated that they were able to supplement cognitive restructuring with additional approaches that take  advantage of their roles as instructor and authority figure. Teachers can work with the problem directly by helping perfectionists to shape their thinking as they set goals and expectations prior to classroom tasks, to cope with the events that occur as they work on the tasks, and to evaluate their performance both as it unfolds and after it has been completed.

This study sought an answer to the question of what are the perceptions, attitudes, feelings, and self-reported behaviors of young people that lead to traffic safety problems and/or interfere with their solutions. The investigators conducted focus group discussions, and administered a semantic differential instrument and a data sheet on driving to 316 young drivers selected from the target population. The data from this research are presented on tables with accompanying narrative discussion, which identifies and analyzes specific problems revealed by the responses of participants. Results indicated a wide range of individual differences,  and many unsafe driving practices appear to be rooted in emotional rather than cognitive causes. Driving while under the influence of drugs or alcohol appeared to carry little stigma with young people. It is suggested that driver improvement programs should be approached from the perspective of the young drivers themselves, including: (1) focusing on their values and goals; (2) recognizing the possible social attractiveness of unsafe driving; (3) identifying and dealing with the emotional causes of unsafe driving; and (4) assisting young people to find ways other than unsafe driving to achieve their personal goals.

Administrators must remember the following four points when they use test scores for compensatory education students: (1) test scores alone should not be used to select students; (2) good programs select students through several assessment tools rather than just one; (3) administrators should not use out-of-level tests; and (4) the use of tests for lower grade levels may be less frustrating for some students, but will not give an accurate picture of the content learned or the real meaning of the scores. It is also important to understand that the term &quot;grade level&quot; in  testing does not relate to how well students perform in the classroom. When students score at grade level, about half of their peers score higher and about half score lower. Administrators must also differentiate the degree of error in individual and group scores. Interpretations are most sure when administrators consider district averages, followed by building averages, classroom averages, and individual students' scores. (SLD)",

        "description":"Both norm-referenced and criterion-referenced interpretations of student, school, district, and state testing data can be improved by customizing the traditional norm-referenced test. Improvements that can be made include: (1) increasing the relevance of the test to the curriculum and (2) having greater confidence in the national comparative information. Testing time can also be reduced. For the past several years, Texas has used a model state criterion-referenced test that was statistically equated to a nationally norm-referenced test. In spite of the reduced testing time and greater relevance to the curriculum of this approach, Texas will leave this model in 1990 for one that may be more successful in producing scores that approach norm validity. A second model of a custom-made  test is one in which state or district-developed criterion-referenced items are combined with a complete norm-referenced test. Norm invalidity may still be a problem if norm-referenced scores are inflated by instruction targeted at the objectives. In Tennessee, a third model of a customized test remedies the shortcomings of the first two models and provides objective scores for instructional planning and norm-referenced scores for national comparisons. Customized norm-referenced tests offer a viable alternative to both norm-referenced and criterion-referenced tests. (SLD)",

Developed in 1942 for military personnel who had not graduated from high school, the GED Tests enabled veterans to qualify for jobs or enter college. More than 10 million persons have earned GED Test diplomas since 1971. There are five parts to the GED Tests: (1) Writing Skills; (2) Social Studies; (3) Science; (4) Interpreting Literature and the Arts; and (5) Mathematics. Test questions are multiple choice, with the exception of part of the writing skills assessment. While no formal preparation is required, many people attend adult education classes before taking the GED Tests. Each participating state and province sets its own passing scores at or above a minimum level set by the American Council on  Education. Tests are given regularly throughout the United States, Canada, and overseas. A small fee is charged and it is possible to retake the GED Tests in the event of failure. While the diploma is no guarantee of employment or college entrance, 92% of colleges and 96% of employers accept the GED Tests as the equivalent of a high school diploma. (SLD)",

        "description":"This issue of &quot;ETS Policy Notes&quot; discusses gender differences in educational achievement. The first article--&quot;The Gender Gap in Education: How Early and How Large?&quot;--discusses the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), which first measures achievement at age 9 years. Gender differences at that age are generally small, but significant in some academic subjects. By age 17, average scores for females are higher in reading and writing; with males, advantages are apparent in science and mathematics. Student attitudes begin to affect curriculum choices in the high school years and large differences emerge as college-bound seniors report their choice of intended college major. ETS publications reflecting data from the NAEP are listed at the end of the article. The second  article--&quot;Scholastic Ability&quot;--considers the gender differences in performance on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT). Over the years, male and female verbal scores have converged, although males still outperform females in mathematics. Information on a more detailed report on gender differences in SAT takers is provided. The third article--&quot;Sex Differences in Test Performance: A Synthesis of Research&quot;--describes a comprehensive new summary of several decades of research on these gender differences, prepared by ETS researchers G. Wilder and K. Powel. This synthesis suggests that performance differences may be slowly diminishing, although women still lag in some aspects of spatial ability  and achievement at the top levels of mathematics. (SLD)",

        "author":["Eason, Sandra H."],
        "description":"Generalizability theory provides a technique for accurately estimating the reliability of measurements. The power of this theory is based on the simultaneous analysis of multiple sources of error variances. Equally important, generalizability theory considers relationships among the sources of measurement error. Just as multivariate inferential statistics consider relationships among variables that univariate statistics cannot detect, generalizability theory considers relationships of error measurement that classical theory cannot. An extensive discussion of the concept of reliability and its use in classical test theory and generalizability theory is presented. A comparison of classical test theory and generalizability theory illustrates how generalizability theory subsumes all  other reliability estimates as special cases. A hypothetical data set provides examples of when the failure to use generalizability theory can lead to seriously erroneous estimates of test reliability. The framework of generalizability theory incorporates two stages of analysis: (1) a generalizability study; and (2) a decision study. The former analyzes the extent to which results are generalizable to a population, while the latter uses information from the generalizability study to determine other generalizability coefficients for variations of the measurement protocol. Six data tables are provided, and an appendix presents the GENOVA program code used. (TJH)",

        "description":"A study involving teachers and administrators from 16 elementary, middle, and high schools in Tennessee investigated the factorial structure of the Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS). The SDLRS includes 58 Likert-like items designed to measure the readiness of adult learners to assume self-direction in the learning process. Study subjects were participants in TN LEAD, a statewide school leadership development program. A total of 439 subjects completed and returned the SDLRS. Exploratory factor analysis of the SDLRS was conducted using principal components factor solutions with orthogonal rotation. Application of the Kaiser-Guttman rule provided 15 initial factors with eigenvalues greater than 1. A scree test was conducted to extract the four most significant factors.  Using orthogonal rotations, two- and four-factor models were examined. A reliability analysis of the total SDLRS was conducted using Cronbach's coefficient alpha; the reliability and corrected split-half reliability were 0.93 and 0.89, respectively. It is concluded that the SDLRS has an underlying structure of four dimensions measuring readiness for self-directed learning: (1) love of and enthusiasm for learning; (2) self-confidence in the ability to learn; (3) self-concept as an independent learner; and (4) tolerance of ambiguity, risk, and complexity in learning. Eight data tables are included. (TJH)",

Seven criteria for avoiding failure to use research and evaluative information are discussed; these criteria are associated with historical relevance, the diagnosis of a specific problem, environmental support, organizational structure and individual attitudes, manipulability of the factor, political and economic feasibility, and effectiveness. In order to be more effective in impressing the importance of research upon  policymakers and practitioners, researchers must make a better effort to understand cognition or the \"action frames of mind\" of such potential research users.

In three of the schools, the data were collected using conventional Q-sort procedures. In the remaining four schools, data were collected using an unmarked graphic scale. Separate principal components Q-technique factor analyses were used with the data collected in each school, and results were rotated to the varimax criterion. For each of the seven Q-technique analyses, factor stability  was assessed by consulting the magnitude of the eigenvalue of the first factor extracted, the mean eigenvalue of all extracted factors, the average squared communality value, and the mean factor structure coefficient. Results indicate that the data collected via the unmarked graphic scale produced more stable and reliable Q-factors than did data collected via traditional Q-sort procedures.

        "description":"Historically, most researchers conducting factor analysis have used exploratory methods. However, more recently, confirmatory factor analytic methods have been developed that can directly test theory either during factor rotation using &quot;best fit&quot; rotation methods or during factor extraction, as with the LISREL computer programs developed by K. G. Joreskog et al. (1986). This study provides a heuristic example that illustrates some comparisons between statistical results obtained using exploratory and confirmatory factor analytic techniques with a data set of scores of 145 junior high school students on 26 psychological tests. The first analysis used exploratory factor extraction of orthogonal principal components followed by confirmatory rotation to determine goodness of fit. The  second analysis used confirmatory extraction of five factors based on theoretical expectations. Results indicate that exploratory and confirmatory factor analytic procedures can yield different results. While exploratory methods are an invaluable aid in the initial structuring of behavioral constructs, confirmatory methods serve the researcher in the affirmation or rejection of models derived using theoretical considerations or exploratory factor analytic techniques. Seven tables present the data set. An appendix lists the tests taken by the students, and a second appendix gives the LISREL commands for running the second analysis.

        "description":"An attempt to develop a locus of control scale that would differentiate one's sense of control over events that are highly controllable from one's sense of control over events that are typically uncontrollable by the individual is described. It was hypothesized that the more remote events are from one's personal control (e.g., events in the lives of others, acts of nature, international events), the greater the likelihood that perceived control over the events will be non-adaptive. This study attempted to identify conceptual and quantitative clusters within the newly designed scale and to relate scores on these clusters to scores on the internal/external dimension of Rotter's Internal/External (I/E) scale. An attempt was also made to evaluate the convergent and divergent validity  of the conceptual and quantitative clusters by assessing predicted relationships between these clusters and other physical and psychological measures included in a large test battery. Focus was on determining what clusters of events best differentiate adaptive from non-adaptive internality. The original 72-item scale and several established inventories, including the Rotter I/E scale, were given to approximately 930 students at the University of Tennessee (Knoxville), Pellissippi State Technical Community College, and Carson-Newman College (Jefferson City). Confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses were conducted on subject responses. After the factor analysis process, 34 items were retained in the scale. Several correlations between the factors of the revised instrument and other  indicators of health showed that the perception of non-adaptive control was related to higher perceived stress. A table represents the rotated factor pattern. (SLD)",

The ETS is also responsible for estimating the extent and correlates of cognitive growth that takes place between the sophomore and senior year in high school; this latter analysis involves testing the 1980 HSB sophomore cohort and following them in 1982 with the same test battery. To discharge these responsibilities, an extensive psychometric analysis, reported here, was undertaken. The analysis was designed to: (1) estimate possible effects of differing administrative procedures from one  cohort to another on tested performance; (2) evaluate whether the tests were measuring the same things across cohorts or within different administrations within the same cohort; (3) estimate item statistics, reliabilities, and indices of precision of measurement for separate tests and determine whether these measures are invariant across sex and ethnic group; and (4) develop and apply latent trait theory procedures where appropriate. There is little empirical evidence for the notion that the tests or test parcels measure different things for different ethnic or sex groups. The biggest gains over the 2-year schooling period were in vocabulary and reading. White students showed greater gains that did either of the other ethnic groups. There was a consistent tendency for Hispanic women to  show greater gains than Hispanic men, and for the test score variance to increase from the sophomore to senior year. Student test booklet samples, 25 data tables, and 22 figures are included. (TJH)",

The level of specificity increases as one proceeds from general to enabling objectives. Instructional and enabling objectives are written  in student-centered terms, describing what student behavior should be after some period of instruction. An objective generally contains three parts: (1) a stem, stating the desired behavior; (2) conditions, under which the identified behavior is to be evaluated; and (3) criteria, or standards of acceptable performance students must demonstrate.

The vast majority of districts has shown steady improvement in norm-referenced test scores over the past 15 years despite the fact that other indicators of achievement do not reflect gains in American education. By early 1988 all 50 states were testing above the publisher's national norm, a phenomenon dubbed the &quot;Lake Wobegon&quot; effect, in reference to the mythical town where all children are above average. The survey  conducted for this report in 1989 found 48 of the 50 states again scoring above the national norm, while 90% of elementary schools and 80% of secondary schools exceeded the national norm. The causes of this phenomenon (including possible cheating, deceptive testing practices, and misleading reporting methods) are discussed, and steps to avoid cheating are reviewed. A final chapter considers the effects of these inflated scores. Three appendices present: the test results from the 50 states; a survey of test security practices; and other indicators of state achievement. (SLD)",

The basic steps are described in an introductory section; they are (1) to specify the institutional objectives of the curriculum and ensure their instructional validity; and (2) to specify the characteristics, such as the purpose and time-constraints, of the test. The second chapter concerns writing the test items and conducting item content validity and content bias analyses to determine which items to keep. The next chapter is devoted to examining item psychometrics, which involves testing items and analyzing and revising them. The fourth chapter, on constructing tests, describes: (1) asembling the tests; (2) constructing the consensual validity and standards  analyses; and (3) &quot;testing&quot; the test through pilot administration. Finally, a section on analyzing usage results discusses: (1) administering the test; (2) analyzing the posttest data; and (3) planning for new editions. Eight appendices comprising the greater part of the document include: a detailed list of test development procedures; a Curriculum Survey Form; a Sample Item Specification Form; the script for the audiovisual presentation &quot;How to Write Multiple-Choice Achievement Items,&quot; with three work packets, and a sample Item Specification sheet; the text of the booklet &quot;Instructions for Item Review of Achievement Test Items&quot; with a sample item record for item review; a sample item record with all data included; sample test review instructions and questionnaires; and the technical  manual for the North Carolina Test of Algebra 1 as a sample.

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is (1) to discuss a set of standards that can be used to evaluate potential assessment instruments; and (2) to use these standards to evaluate the American College Testing Program's College Outcomes Measures Program (ACT-COMP) and the Educational Testing Service (ETS) Academic Profile. Using the work of S. Messick (1975, 1987, 1988) on construct validity, researchers examined the substantive, structural, and external components of use of these tests by the Tennessee Higher Education Commission (THEC) and the University of Tennessee (Knoxville). The COMP was administered to 1,828 seniors, and the Academic Profile was administered to 1,173 seniors. Also, 35 seniors agreed to take both examinations. The Academic Profile was superior in its ability to  differentiate accurately among students and programs. Both tests appeared to measure a single underlying construct, and analysis suggests that this construct is academic ability, not program quality. That the THEC defines effective general education in terms of test scores is particularly troubling in light of these findings. It is contended that the THEC guidelines may: (1) unjustifiably limit the substance of general education to a narrow range of learning outcomes; (2) award funds on the basis of differences that are well within the error of measurement for the examinations; and, most importantly (3) evaluate programs on the basis of the students they attract rather than quality of the education those students receive. Eleven tables of comparisons and one figure illustrating Messick's  concept of validity are provided. (SLD)",

Samejima's graded model to determine the level of differential item functioning (DIF). Students had been tested using Form 8 of the ACT-COMP objective test either as freshmen or as seniors. The test contains 60 multiple-choice items, each of which has two correct answers. The model developed by Samejima (1969) for graded responses, which uses a series of binary models to describe polychotomous data, was used to assess the data. Student response patterns were fitted to the graded model and five items that did not fit the model were dropped. The remaining items were analyzed using threshold  parameters and their standard errors to calculate difficulty-shift coefficients. Results indicate that: (1) for 32 of the 55 remaining items, significant instances of DIF are present; (2) instances of DIF are not evenly distributed among the six subscales of the ACT-COMP test; (3) questions designed to assess explanation skills produce higher rates of DIF than do questions designed to assess skills related to identification and description; and (4) activities that rely on blueprints, require interpretation of satire, or use a radio news format to produce high levels of DIF.

A sample of 103 elementary school teachers from 39 school districts indicated that the tests and standards generally met with favorable reception. Some of the teachers commented that they found the tests useful for diagnostics and comparisons, while others observed that the tests encouraged teachers to teach to the specific objectives included on the test. Teachers were divided as to the usefulness of state curriculum guides. Several teachers noted that the guides were needed, especially to ensure curricular consistency among districts, although they involved increased  paperwork. The impact in the classroom from the tests and guides has been an effort to teach to or better prepare students for the test and emphasize standardized testing techniques. The primary flaw in the new standards is a lack of adequate funding to ensure their full implementation. Some other problems listed were related to the lack of uniformity in implementation by districts. Some teachers felt that the standards were not well thought out or were so vague that interpretation was difficult. Despite the problems, several teachers stated that the standards were needed or long overdue. The 15 Likert-scale questions administered to the teachers are listed. (TJH)",

        "description":"Conditional observed score (COS) and latent trait (LT) definitions of differential item functioning (DIF) are explored to determine when they are equivalent. COS methods rely solely on observed measurements, and LT methods model the response to an item as a function of an unobserved hypothetical latent ability or trait. For the case of dichotomous test items, the COS approach defines DIF by population differences in the conditional probabilities of responding correctly to the item, conditioning on the observed ability measure. The LT approach defines DIF by population differences in the conditional probabilities of responding correctly to the item, conditioning on the latent trait. Although DIF detection methods are usually applied to dichotomous ability or achievement test  items, the discussion focuses on a more general level, and the results may have applications for general questions of measurement invariance in multiple populations. It is concluded that the conditions under which COS and LT definitions are equivalent are quite specialized. Equivalence generally requires invariance of the conditional densities. Other conditions of equivalence are discussed. It appears that precise invariance of prior densities can rarely be assumed in practice. (TJH)",

Project ADAPT is designed to provide services to meet the needs of chronically mentally ill residents of nursing homes. Specifically, the project provides staff trained to work with the mentally handicapped and therapeutic intervention to raise motivation levels. Fifteen clients of Project ADAPT at each of two facilities were selected for observation. Observations were made during the last 2 weeks of March 1984, before Project ADAPT had begun at either location. Two pairs of independent raters averaged 94.44% and 95.37% agreement, respectively, establishing very high reliability for the COC. The validity of the COC was  determined by correlating subscale totals with case manager ratings on the Treatment Setting Determination Survey. Despite two sources of potential error variance, intercorrelations between bathing and dressing subscales/items all exceeded 0.70, establishing the validity of the COC. The COC required an average of 19.67 minutes to administer. The non-significant tendency for clients at one facility to have a higher level of functioning is described as consistent with the nonequivalent control group design used for evaluation. Two data tables and the COC are included. (TJH)",

Results from a 1973 study were compared with results collected in 1987 using the same instrument to measure changes in language and culture-related behaviors. A survey of nearly 190 American Samoans graduating seniors was conducted in May 1973 to determine the extent to which the English language had penetrated into Samoan society and to determine the impact of western education on the culture, language, and traditional behaviors of American Samoan youth. Subjects for the current study were 173 students attending American Samoa Community College. Data were collected using the background information sheet developed for the  initial survey. The general design of the self-report instrument was adopted from the Acculturation Scales of D. Gold (1966). Comparing 1973 and 1987 results indicated a general shift to increased English usage and a decrease in the amount of Samoan language used in nearly all interpersonal situations. Samoan did continue to be the primary language used with parents, but was no longer the primary language with siblings. In 1987 students had shifted their preferences toward western styles of dress, an overt characteristic of acculturation. These findings reflect the need to determine the educational and cultural priorities of the American Samoan population. Three tables contain study data. (SLD)",

The applicability and effectiveness of the 11-lesson MONEY SENSE program was evaluated in six California locations for 190 clients. Indicators of effectiveness were: (1) change in frequency of financial problems; (2) change in self-perception of financial status; (3) change in average weekly food cost per person; (4) food consumption index score; (5) change in percentage of food shopping skills used; and (6) change in percentage of money management skills used. The 16 situational variables posited as influential were concurrently entered into two regression equations (restricted and unrestricted) for  each of the outcome measures, and the validity of the two models was assessed. The analysis illustrated the use of a technique for determining whether the unrestricted equation (one specific to a subset) or the restricted equation (a regression equation for all members of a set) represents a better fit. In the example, the fit of the unrestricted equation was superior for three outcome measures, supporting the intuitive understanding that application of a curriculum in multiple locations does not mean that the program operates identically in all locations.

Confidential interviews with 16 health and safety professional staff members were charted to graphically illustrate staff concerns and were categorized for relevant issues.

The external evaluator thought that there had been one instance  in which the university acted unethically, but found no evidence of a cover-up; staff members recognized no examples of unethical action, but some believed there might have been a cover-up.

The studies clearly indicated higher pass rates for GED candidates, considered a direct result of the instructional program offered through Iowa's community colleges, than for high school seniors. The current minimal standard of 35 and 45 could be raised to 40 and 45 without having a significant negative impact on the candidate population.

Despite the diversity of the seven focus groups, their comments yielded some common themes about the Career Ladder program. The most dominant was a perceived overall lack of district readiness to adopt a program of the scope and magnitude of the Career Ladder program and a lack of needed organization. Related to this finding was the expressed need for an agreed-on  curriculum. A separate focus group for the Career Ladders Pilot District Network served as a check on the internal validity of the conceptual structure being piloted in the district, and it defined concerns about program implementation. This group was far more positive in its evaluation of the developing Career Ladders program than were the school district focus groups. Follow-up interviews were conducted with five of the seven focus groups (parents and central staff could not be rescheduled). The focus group format is a powerful tool for validation of the theoretical model for program development by giving all groups a chance to express themselves. (SLD)",

        "description":"With funds received under the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act (ECIA) Chapter 2, the Computer Discretionary Grant was designed to train Philadelphia (Pennsylvania) School District teachers in personal computer operations. Teams comprised of middle and junior high school teachers were allowed to enroll in the staff development program. Each team consisted of a science teacher and mathematics teacher from the same school. Twenty public and four non-public school teachers participated in the program. Funds were used to purchase software and pay leaders and teachers. Two-hour staff development sessions were conducted over a 15-week period at a computer laboratory housed in a high school. Teacher teams were expected to instruct classes after their training. Training  sessions were rated highly by participants, but the teaching sequence was not implemented because school administrators were not able to complete their commitment. Nevertheless, teacher reactions indicate that mathematics and science teachers acquired the skills necessary to apply computer technology to the instructional process. Student progress objectives seemed to be too ambitious considering the time allotted. Future programs should be based on verified capabilities of participating schools and qualifications of participating teachers. Feasibility analyses, follow-up support, software disbursement records, and continued program evaluation should also be included in future program implementations. The Teacher Workshop Reaction Form, the ECIA Chapter 2 Science and Technology Grant Final  Examination, and three data tables are provided. (TJH)",

        "description":"This paper reports the results of a qualitative evaluation of the Chapter 1 Program Improvement Workshop Series--Level II, funded by the Educational Testing Service, Technical Assistance Center (TAC), for Region 3. Focus is on the role of commitment in influencing change. The methodological approach, advocated by M. Q. Patton (1986), focuses on: (1) appropriateness, utility, practicality, credibility, and relevance to clients; and (2) &quot;hidden agenda&quot; issues or participants' gut-level reactions to programming. Hidden agenda can only be revealed through direct observation and face-to-face interviews. Factors identified as influencing commitment include information about the program, support at the state level, an emphasis on parent advocacy, and multiple roles played by TAC  facilitators. Factors affecting willingness to change included commitment of new administrative personnel and the increased emphasis on the role of the Chapter 1 teacher. Finally, the use of exemplary and innovative programs was emphasized. The use of qualitative techniques of data collection allowed evaluators to play a much stronger role in formative evaluation.

        "description":"Commonality analysis may be used as an adjunct to general linear methods as a means of determining the degree of predictive ability shared by two or more independent variables. For each independent variable, commonality analysis indicates how much of the variance of the dependent variable is unique to the predictor and how much of the predictor's explanatory power is common to or also available from one or more of the other predictor variables. Commonality analysis is particularly useful in social science research involving multivariate data sets with at least one predictor at the interval level of scale, since, unlike many analyses of variance techniques, it does not require that all the independent variables be converted to the nominal level of scale. A small, hypothetical data  set is presented to illustrate the value of commonality analysis and to demonstrate its usefulness in interpreting results from educational experiments using both univariate and multivariate methods. The statistical examples provided serve as models to researchers of ways of implementing commonality analysis as an adjunct to various univariate and multivariate statistical methods.

        "description":"In March 1989, the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory entered into a contract with the Nevada Department of Education to develop this evaluation design for the Nevada Proficiency Examination (NPE) Program. The NPE program, mandated by state legislation, requires each school district to administer examinations in all public schools to determine student achievement in reading, writing, and mathematics in grades 3, 6, 9, and before completion of grade 12 (usually grade 11). No formal evaluation of the program had previously been conducted. To maximize the chances of providing useful information for decision makers, the evaluation proposed to: review the literature; conduct survey research to collect data from stakeholder groups; maintain an orientation toward program  improvement; and use cost efficient methods. Three general areas were identified for the evaluation: (1) similarities and differences between the Nevada program and comparable activities in other states; (2) program administration issues; and (3) program improvement issues. Descriptive statistical methods were planned for analysis of the data collected. The evaluation was scheduled for the fall of 1989, prior to a planned changeover in the tests used to determine proficiency. Appendices comprising half the document contain survey forms and interview questions planned for the evaluation. (SLD)",

The value of deliberate efforts to teach students test-taking skills is supported by research. Activities to prepare students include the following: (1) teachers should develop some of their tests and worksheets in formats similar to those of standardized tests to increase the students' familiarity with the format; (2) a comfortable and appropriate place should be established for testing, since the physical environment in which testing is conducted can make a difference in student performance; and (3) test-taking skill programs may be offered. These programs should cover: (1) the purposes of testing; (2) the mechanics of taking tests; (3) the development of  strategies for various types of items; (4) practice in synthesizing the main ideas from a paragraph; (5) practice in making inferences; and (6) test anxiety and how it can be overcome.

        "description":"This volume reports the major findings and tabulated statistics of the Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup Polls of the Public's Attitudes toward the Public Schools for a 20-year period, beginning with the first poll in 1969 and ending with the 1988 poll. Each of the Gallup Organization's 20 annual reports is the basis of a chapter in the book, and each chapter contains some of the questions and responses of the respective year's polls. As a result of this organization, the book also serves as a history of education in the period. Each chapter is preceded by an essay based on feature articles entitled &quot;The Year's Ten Most Important Education Events,&quot; produced each year by Ben Brodinsky for the Educational Press Association of America. Certain questions were asked repeatedly in the 20-year  period, providing a database of information. Each year a sample of between 1,505 and 2,118 adults in the United States of voting age, in all parts of the country and all types of neighborhoods, has been polled. In 1970, 1971, and 1974, between 250 and 299 high school juniors and seniors were also interviewed. In 1972 and 1973, 270 educators and 306 educators, respectively, were interviewed. Starting from a high of 44% in 1969, the percentage of respondents with children in public school dwindled gradually until reaching an average of about 28% for the past 11 years; however, it went up to 31% in 1987. The percentage of respondents with children in non-public schools has been fairly constant, generally 5% to 8%. Together, the polls show that increased public familiarity with the schools  results in increased public respect. Educators must make sure that the public understands what the schools can do best with the resources that are available to them. Appendix 1 explains the sampling and research procedures of the polls. Appendix 2 describes the Polling Attitudes of the Community on Education (PACE) program, which assists communities in conducting local polls. Appendix 3 describes differences between educators and the public on questions of educational policy. (SLD)",

        "description":"Several public school choice programs are reviewed, and the model program implemented by the Montclair (New Jersey) Public Schools is evaluated. School choice models include: the regulated voucher system, alternative schools, and magnet schools. The Montclair system is an urban school district that has achieved success in desegregating its schools through a voluntary magnet school plan based on choice. Montclair has a total enrollment of 5,104 students, of which 49% are minority students. To study the effectiveness of Montclair's plan in providing racial balance across schools and educational quality and diversity in programs through the use of choice, a case study of the district was conducted in 1987 and a follow-up was completed in the summer of 1989. The choice program allows  parents to select the school that they wish their children to attend and register that choice with the central office. The research methodology used to assess the Montclair magnet system involved combining qualitative data (interviews, observation, and document reviews) with quantitative data (standardized tests, enrollments, and census data). Areas assessed include the level of racial integration at the school and classroom levels, general racial climate, quality of education, school climate, curriculum and instruction quality, and program diversity. A 41-item list of references, three figures, and eight data tables are included. A discussion of the case study method is appended. (TJH)",

Interviews were conducted in the 1987-88 school year as part of the Ecology of Evaluation research project conducted in Ontario and British Columbia. About 50 elementary and secondary educators were interviewed in Ontario, with about half being teachers. All three levels of educators reported that factors associated with the Canadian Ministry of Education, school boards, and school policies influenced the ways in which they evaluated students. Some of the influences were identified as constraints, but many were identified as being resources for the educators and sources of practices for better recordkeeping  and achievement reporting. Respondents also indicated that they received support for their evaluation efforts from their peers more often than from educators at a higher level in the same school. Support from people at a higher level was more likely to come from the district or the Ministry of Education than from within the school. Findings highlight the importance of two areas needing greater recognition: (1) a distinction that should be made between evaluation in theory and in practice; and (2) the informal network of peer support that influences evaluation practices.

The sample was 64% male, 80% White, 15% Black, and 4% Hispanic. The NCQ has been shown by T. J. Tracey and W. E. Sedlacek (1984) to have validity in predicting the success, particularly retention and graduation, of non-traditional students (e.g., cultural and racial minorities, international students). Three of the eight NCQ scales (support person, community, and self-concept) combined to predict first semester grade point average. Scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) had essentially no correlation with freshman  grades. It was concluded that SAT scores should not be used to prevent athletes from competing in their first year. It was further suggested that thinking of athletes as traditional students in special circumstances may be doing them a disservice. It may be more meaningful to consider athletes as non-traditional students with their own cultures and problems in relating to the larger system. Other research identifying prejudice toward athletes supports this point. Suggestions are made for programs for athletes and others on campus. Three data tables are included. (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"Item banks, large sets of test items, can be used for the construction of achievement tests. Mathematical programming models have been proposed for the selection of items from an item bank for a test. These models make automated test construction possible. However, to find an optimal or even an approximate optimal solution to a test construction model can be time consuming. This paper shows how test construction models, and in particular the Maximin Model, are solvable by the program MPSX/370 V2. This program offers the user several implementations of the branch-and-bound method, which can be used for solving test construction models. Several implementations are compared. The results show that test construction models are solvable in a practical amount of time if the user applies  the options offered by the program in an intelligent way. An appendix describes the Extended Control Language (ECL) computer program. Five data tables and two figures are included. (Author/SLD)",

This manual reasserts the goals of the coordinated compliance review process as: decreasing monitoring visits by the CSDE; reducing duplication of efforts; increasing local responsibility; ensuring that categorically funded students are provided with the district's core curriculum; and providing technical and management assistance to the LEAs in preventing and resolving  non-compliance problems. These goals are to be accomplished by monitoring: (1) specially funded educational programs; (2) school-based coordinated programs; (3) student motivation and maintenance programs; (4) child development programs; (5) consolidated programs; (6) migrant education; (7) special education; (8) vocational education; and (9) adult education.

Two types of delay were studied: (1) delay in beginning at a particular type of institution, and (2) stopping out for a period before returning (i.e., leaving school for over 2 months or a summer period and returning to school afterwards). This report uses information about the educational progress of 1972 seniors from the National Longitudinal Study and information from the 1980 senior and sophomore cohorts of the High School and Beyond Study. The data are taken from all years between the graduating year and February of 1986, when the last follow-up survey was conducted on each cohort. Over 40% of the high school  graduates had enrolled in 4-year institutions by 1986, about 30% enrolled in 2-year institutions, and about 10% enrolled in less-than-2-year institutions. More students in 4-year institutions entered during the fall term after high school graduation than did students in other types of PIs. Delayed entry was most common for students in less-than-2-year institutions, and this was true for students from all three cohorts, regardless of gender or socioeconomic status (SES). Students from high SES backgrounds were less likely to delay entry into 4-year institutions than were other students, and a higher proportion of low SES students in 4-year institutions delayed entry than did either medium or high SES students. There was no consistent relationship between gender and the likelihood of delay  among students at any PI. The combined rate of degree attainment and upward transfer was higher for students who entered postsecondary education immediately after high school than for students who delayed entering postsecondary education. At non-4-year institutions, attainment rates for stopouts were consistently lower than for delayed entrants. Four bar graphs and five data tables are provided. A discussion of the methodology and technical notes, a glossary, and supporting tables are included. (RLC)",

Three tables provide information for each cohort on enrollment in PE by type of postsecondary institution. Three other tables show the mean length of delay in months for each type of school. They also show the percentage of delayed entrants enrolling within 2 years, from 2 to 3 years, and more than 3 years after high school graduation.

Data elements used in this analysis for the 1980 senior and sophomore  cohorts were drawn from the base year and first through third follow-up surveys. Data for the 1972 senior cohort were drawn from the base year, first through fifth follow-ups, and transcript file. Selected results indicate that: students entering 2-year or 4-year institutions delayed entry less than did those who entered institutions offering less-than-2-year programs; a higher proportion of students who entered 4-year institutions entered in the fall term immediately after high school graduation, as compared to students in other types of institutions; and compared to the 1972 cohort, a higher proportion of the postsecondary students from the 1980 and 1982 graduating classes enrolled in institutions offering programs of less than 2 years.

The study is linked with a larger cultural context through an investigation of the occurrence of the term \"at risk\" in the educational literature over the past 10 years. The characteristics of the Suroeste School District and the Raintree School District (Arizona), the schools within each district, and the administration personnel within are contrasted. These district and school differences are then compared to the responses of each district to at-risk students. The differences between these school systems  in their definition of at risk and their responses to at-risk students are discussed. In general, the smaller schools and the smaller, less centralized district, were less rigid in both identification of students and response to the educational difficulties.

Under existing law, the incentives are paid from state funds that otherwise would be distributed to districts throughout the state. The following cost factors are discussed: (1) the per pupil cost of the city-suburban program  is nearly twice the cost of education in the average Wisconsin school district; (2) costs are growing at a rate much faster than student participation; (3) the majority of funds paid to local school districts represent financial incentives that exceed actual education costs; and (4) city-suburban busing costs exceeded $2,100 per pupil in 1986-87, nearly half the entire per-pupil cost of education in the average state school district. Local school officials should work with the governor and the state legislature to develop financial reforms, and the parties involved in the lawsuit settlement might need to modify the agreement to reflect the new financial structure. Statistical data are included on six graphs. (FMW)",

        "description":"School choice is advocated on the theory that deregulation and greater market control can restructure and improve education. While certain market strategies of improvement are worth exploring, complex production functions, unclear goals, and the political role of education in society limit the extent to which education can be understood and improved as a market. This document clarifies the public choice critique of education, describes the conditions of choice in a large urban magnet-based voluntary desegregation program, and analyzes central assumptions and propositions of public choice theory about family preferences and the organizational effects of choice. Data from the Milwaukee (Wisconsin) Public Schools (MPS) magnet/voluntary desegregation program were collected and  analyzed. The following major topics are discussed: (1) the political and economic arguments supporting choice in public education; (2) differences and similarities between the MPS system and traditional systems, emphasizing limitations on mandatory assignment policies; (3) choices and attendance patterns of inner city black families and the correlates of magnet participation; (4) the effects of choice on teacher attitudes and organizational outcomes as measured by a teacher survey; and (5) potential system-level consequences of choice in MPS for achieving goals of educational equity and efficiency. Statistical data are included on 20 tables and 10 graphs. The following materials are appended: (1) a 255-item bibliography; (2) the results of a teacher survey of elementary and middle magnet  and nonmagnet schools; (3) the differences in resource inputs between magnet and nonmagnet schools; and (4) a scatterplot of student composition variables for elementary magnet and nonmagnet schools.

The following facts about barriers and opportunities for young black men are discussed: (1) high black poverty rates persist and the black poor are getting poorer; (2) the number of underclass areas has doubled in recent years; (3) economic shifts have reduced black  earnings and job opportunities; (4) young black males have lower marriage rates; (5) poor black males face major obstacles to education, particularly college; (6) black males are at greater risk of arrest and incarceration; and (7) young black men are at high risk of death from violence, substance abuse, and AIDS.

The plan is designed to raise the level of awareness of schools and school districts to the needs of homeless children and to provide ideas and suggestions for meeting those needs. It is organized into five sections. Section 1 covers development and implementation of the plan at the state level and development and coordination of the plan at the local level. Section 2 covers resolution of disputes about placement at state and local levels. Section 3 covers elimination of barriers to educating homeless children. The following barriers are discussed: (1) residency requirements; (2) immunization requirements; (3) registration  requirements; and (4) requirements for school records. Section 4 covers provision of equal access to educational programs and services at the state and local level. Section 5 covers promoting, implementing, and monitoring the plan. Five appendixes contain information that school districts should find helpful as they develop policies and procedures, examine residency requirements, and design strategies for educating homeless children. Appendix A contains the Stewart B. McKinney Act of 1987, Subtitle B, and related definitions. Appendix B contains survey results. Appendix C contains legal information about the residency requirements for homeless children. Appendix D contains three scenarios of the lives of homeless children. Appendix E contains a list of educational programs for homeless  children. (JS)",

The following disconnections between education and the economy are discussed: (1) mismatches between school and non-school settings in the structure of knowledge used and the social structure of its use; (2) differences between employers' and  educators' perceptions of problems; (3) problems with the signalling systems between school and work settings; and (4) organizational differences between schools and industries. The following economic changes that affect post-secondary education and training are discussed: (1) conflict between labor demand and supply; (2) employers' training investment patterns and their consequences; and (3) changing patterns of employer training investment. The following recommendations for the federal role in education are discussed: (1) reconceptualize the federal role in education; (2) lead efforts to revitalize education; (3) invest in educational research and development; (4) eliminate narrow job-specific vocational education at the secondary level, integrate academic and vocational learning, and  extend this integration through the elementary grades; (5) unify education and training policy; and (6) think through a policy on training vouchers for workers.

The goal of the management information system is to gather and analyze data in order to allocate district and state resources to support student achievement. The system is unique for the following reasons: (1) it coordinates collection of longitudinal data on students from elementary, to junior high, to high school; (2) it provides a system for reporting student placement and progress from the high school level back to the elementary level; and (3)  it allows districts to monitor benefits of resource and financial allocations. Twenty-three variables, including socioeconomic characteristics, school related behaviors and characteristics, and psychological states, form the student's individual profile. Each variable is defined with gradations that teachers or other support personnel use in evaluating students. System design also includes a three-dimensional evaluation of student achievement that assesses the amount of work a student produces, the level of application of what is learned, and the subsequent performance of the student. A student self-assessment component measures academic self-esteem, feelings of personal autonomy, and educational aspirations. A scan document is used to assess each student and allows school districts call  up data relevant to a specific individual or selected population. The system is ideal for reporting state mandated accountability data. A list of three references and a checklist of student socialization behaviors are appended. (FMW)",

The paper is comprised of seven sections. Section 1, \"Introduction,\" discusses theoretical and methodological considerations and presents a demographic overview of Hispanic Americans. Section 2, \"Income and Earnings of Hispanics,\" finds greater declines in family income and individual earnings for Hispanics than for Whites or Blacks during the 1980s. Section 3, \"Poverty and Welfare Use Among Hispanics,\"  indicates increases in the poverty rate and number of welfare recipients. Section 4, \"Education,\" reports increases in Hispanic educational attainment in the 1980s but a persistent lag behind that of Whites. Section 5, \"Homeownership,\" finds Hispanics less likely than Blacks or Whites to own homes in 1986. Section 6, \"Occupation and Labor Force Participation,\" examines trends in employment and unemployment. Section 7, \"Other Measures of Assimilation and Integration,\" uses the following measures to analyze Hispanic assimilation: (1) English language usage; (2) residential integration; (3) intermarriage; and (4) fertility.

Data were gathered using mail-out questionnaires and follow-up telephone calls to Chapter 1 coordinators in 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico and from visits to 12 school districts in six states. The following findings are discussed: (1) 46 states reported that school districts will spend an estimated $105 million for eligible capital expenditures; (2) most states reported that  they will distribute funds to school districts based on eligible capital expenditures and/or enrollment, and that estimated expenditures exceed available funds; (3) immediately following &quot;Felton,&quot; private school student participation dropped by 34 percent but has since risen to within 18 percent of pre-&quot;Felton&quot; levels; and (4) officials at the 12 sites visited reported that they preferred to have public school teachers provide services in the private school building, but they were generally satisfied with the new methods.

        "description":"The &quot;Official English&quot; (OE), or &quot;English Only,&quot; movement claims that the United States is threatened by the use of languages other than English in schools, government, and business. The OE movement is contrary to a national tradition of recognition and respect for the contributions of immigrants to American life. Restrictions on multilingualism are based on and foster an atmosphere of intolerance and xenophobia. The language restrictionist movement is based on the assumption that limited English-speaking persons do not want to learn English. Yet, cities such as New York and Los Angeles have waiting lists for English classes of 10,000 to 30,000 people. The Latino communities of Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, and New York are the prime targets of the OE efforts.  Prohibiting the use of native languages is a threat to civil rights that denies access to voting, educational opportunities, and social services. Those who are serious about encouraging and enhancing the understanding and use of English should devote their efforts to the creation of more English classes and educational facilities. The following materials are appended: (1) a list of eight answers to commonly asked questions about language restriction; (2) a list of organizations opposed to OE; (3) a list of 36 references; and (4) a list of NALEO Education Fund publications.

The following reasons for restructuring are discussed: (1) poor educational performance; and (2) the changing skills needed for today's jobs. The following restructuring options are evaluated: (1) decentralizing authority over schools, which includes school-based management, more professional teaching conditions, and school choice in public education; (2) holding schools more accountable for performance; (3) altering the content and process of classroom instruction; and (4) strengthening school-community links.

The following broad categories of restructuring options are discussed and supporting research is reviewed: (1) decentralizing authority over schooling through school-based management, more professional teaching conditions, and greater parental choice; (2) holding schools more accountable; (3) altering the process and content of classroom instruction; and (4) strengthening the links between schools and the larger community, particularly with business and various social service networks. The following major problems with restructuring are discussed: (1) the connection between the problems of poor educational performance and a changing economy,  and the solutions embodied in different restructuring proposals are not always clear or well-articulated; (2) the causes of the problems with the educational system have yet to be definitively identified; (3) very little attention has been given to the costs of various restructuring options or to the new investments in capacity-building that would be needed; and (4) changes in authority over key educational decisions raise normative questions about the governance of public education and which values should prevail.

Recent scholarship, theory, and experimentation in the classroom highlight flaws in the \"conventional wisdom\" that emphasizes the following approaches to teaching reading, writing, and mathematics to the economically disadvantaged: (1) remediation of the learners' deficits; (2) a curriculum broken down into discrete skills; (3) teacher-directed instruction; (4) a uniform approach to classroom management; and (5) the grouping of students by ability. Appropriately applied, the following  alternatives show promise of improving conventional practice: (1) an emphasis on the knowledge students bring to school; (2) explicit teaching of how to function in the \"culture\" of the school; (3) early emphasis on appropriate \"higher order\" tasks; (4) extensive opportunities to learn and apply skills in context; (5) an emphasis on meaning and understanding in all academic instruction; (6) a combination of teacher-directed and learner-directed instruction; (7) variation in classroom management approaches depending on the kind of academic work being done; (8) some use of grouping arrangements that mix ability levels; and (9) more flexibility in grouping arrangements.

Six groups of vocational educators were examined: agriculture education teacher educators, agriculture administrators, home economics teacher educators, home economics administrators, trade and industrial education teacher educators, and trade and industrial education administrators. There were 160 usable responses from a sample of 300 educators. Subjects were considered to be politically active by virtue of their membership in the American Vocational Association (AVA), the national lobbying group for vocational education. The Ley (1979) study was the basis for this research, and Ley's instruments were used for gathering data: a Background Information Sheet and the Political  Socialization Q-Sort. A factor analysis of the Q-Sort items produced four distinct determinants of political socialization: family as an influence; professional organizations as an influence; significant others as an influence; and graduate school faculty as an influence. No significant differences were found among the groups. The study recommended that vocational educators be encouraged to promote workplace democracy for themselves and their students.

Data were collected through telephone interviews with the state supervisors of technology education in New York and Illinois and with 10 teachers of technology education in each of those states. The following were among the conclusions reported: (1) teachers participated extensively in the implementation stage of the innovation-decision process; (2) teacher involvement in agenda-setting at the state level was not essential to the successful  implementation of technology education programs; (3) successful implementation required an inservice professional development strategy sequence that began with awareness of the philosophy of technology education and then moved to hands-on classroom activities; and (4) a regional inservice professional development strategy contributed most to the classroom success of teachers. (The document also includes 20 guidelines for the statewide implementation of technology education and a 61-item bibliography.) (CML)",

Educational strategies, compatible with cultural norms, are needed that will motivate and prepare the rural communities of this region to take the lead and to implement activities for growth. Furthermore, these strategies must have appropriate support--people, money, and media. Four major educational problems confront the rural areas of South Asia: illiteracy, quality, relevance, and efficiency. Some changes in schooling could be made--for example, reaching out to the children through mass media rather than having them come to central areas for schooling. The educational systems of the countries of South Asia share many common problems, including rising costs in the face of budgetary constraints, lack of curriculum  renewal, lack of textbooks, lack of trained teachers, inadequate level of compatibility between educational systems and the world of work, inadequate supply and use of teaching aids leading to low quality and low systemic efficiency of education, and inadequate access to good education for many groups, especially the rural poor and the disadvantaged. Distance education based on the use of modern communications and multimedia materials could be used to reach some of these people. Such strategies should be researched in order to progress toward education for all. (KC)",

The contents include &quot;Introduction, State and Institutional Trends, Recommendations&quot; (Stewart); &quot;Transferability of Credits between Institutions&quot; (Ludwig); &quot;Articulation between Degree Programs&quot; (Palmer); &quot;Designation of Nontraditional Learning on Academic Transcripts&quot; (Becraft); and &quot;Research Summaries&quot; (Ludwig, Palmer), which are five appendices. The following are among military factors that affect decision making about military personnel seeking postsecondary education opportunities: (1)  the climate within the military is currently favorable toward postsecondary education; (2) military recruits' educational attainment is relatively high; (3) definitions of nontraditional learning are ambiguous; (4) the potential of credit by examination is unrealized; and (5) the postsecondary education community has enthusiastically accepted the Army/ACE Registry Transcript Service (AARTS). The following factors are also important: (1) the percentage of adult and part-time students entering postsecondary educational institutions is growing rapidly; (2) at too many institutions the prevailing assumption remains that the typical student is 18-25 years of age and is following a linear course of study; and (3) the quality control emphasis in postsecondary education may stiffen resistance to  nontraditional programs that have a &quot;diploma mill&quot; image. The document includes a total of 105 references. The appendices provide summary information for methodology, findings, articulation agreements, campus contacts, and trascript evaluation, as well as numerous sample anonymous transcripts. (CML)",

A Likert-type survey instrument was developed and administered to a random sample of 106 freshman students enrolled in the college during the 1989 spring semester, excluding those enrolled in home economics. Usable responses were received from 83 (78 percent) of the students surveyed. Factors that students considered influential in their decision to enroll in the college included their agricultural experiences, the perceived opportunities in agriculture, their interest in agriculture, involvement in the secondary agricultural education program, and a feeling of usefulness. Parents were the most influential persons  in the students' choice of course of study. Other influential factors included students' secondary program and participation in 4-H clubs. Based on the study, recommendations were made that the college's recruitment efforts should focus on (1) the opportunities available in the field of agriculture; (2) the personal feeling of usefulness or accomplishment possible through employment in the agricultural industry; (3) providing agriculturally related experiences for students; and (4) the parents/guardians of students as influences.

High school sophomores and juniors in Los Angeles were invited to Cal Poly for a 26-hour program of workshops designed to include a blend of technology with hands-on experiences (including soil and water testing, irrigation technology, landscape design and installation, artificial insemination, in-vitro fertilization, tissue culture, computer simulations, food processing, and seed identification), tours of the library and off-campus housing, career discussions, and sessions with staff from the Placement Center and Student Academic Services. The students also  participated in a barbecue in their honor and received stenciled T-shirts and a videotape of their experiences in program activities. According to their responses on a questionnaire, a majority of student participants expressed a desire to attend Cal Poly upon graduation. Questionnaire responses from teachers and a counselor who participated as chaperons were also favorable. Judging from their participation in the program, Cal Poly students are in support of the program, which offers them leadership experience. Resources for the 1990 program have been committed. Program modifications will include expansion of the targeted geographical area to include more school districts in the greater Los Angeles area; limitation of participants to 20 so as to not overtax resources; increased efforts to  quell parental reluctance to allow children, especially Hispanic females, to participate; and the establishment of a similar program for high school counselors.

        "description":"Developing a management information system (MIS) is one approach to meeting the information collection, storage, manipulation, and usage needs of cooperative education. Within cooperative education, MIS can help in the areas of accountability, program planning, decision making, management of cooperative education activities, and program evaluation. The following steps are involved in the process of developing an MIS for cooperative education: (1) determining program goals and objectives; (2) identifying information and data needs; (3) building the database by determining data collection and procedures and by determining the methods for storage and manipulation of information; and (4) reporting and using the information. There are a number of commercially available computer  software packages that serve very well as the basis for a locally developed MIS, even though they were not originally developed for that purpose. Among them are The Placement Assistant, Easytrieve, Report Generator, Statistical Analysis Systems, dBase, Reflex, Minitab, and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences.

Ideally, the computer component should be compatible with any mainframe computer in use in the school so that information already available in the student database can be shared between them.

Data were collected by questionnaires administered to all 633 11th-grade nonvocational students enrolled in five randomly selected schools within the Southwest Ohio Region Personnel Development Center during the 1987-88 school year. Sixteen parents of these students were interviewed over the telephone. The statistical analysis included descriptive, correlational, and analysis of  variance techniques. The following are among the results reported: (1) the students whose images of vocational education are most negative are white, male, of a high socioeconomic status, and enrolled in a college preparatory curriculum; (2) males' images were more negative than females', whites' images were more negative than blacks' and other minorities', and the images of those with the highest socioeconomic status were more negative than of those with the lowest socioeconomic status--although sex, race, and socioeconomic status were found to account for only a small amount of the variance; (3) 55 percent of the students said they had neither a positive nor a negative view of vocational education; and (4) parents' images were similar to students'.

        "description":"With current industrial arts/technology teachers aging, and half those in Ohio eligible to retire in 10 years or less, a study was conducted to determine (1) planned retirements and teacher needs of school districts; (2) the number of preservice teacher candidates enrolled in industrial technology programs; and (3) what efforts were being made to attract new and nontraditional students into these teacher education programs. Descriptive data were sought via two questionnaires from 616 public school districts, 59 nonpublic schools that reported industrial technology programs, and 7 teacher education programs in Ohio. Returns were collected from 499 superintendents and 7 teacher education programs. The study showed that the supply of students in teacher education programs in  industrial technology (283) was far less than the projected need. In addition, only seven of the students were women. Moreover, less than three-fourths of the graduates from these programs in 1988 sought state teaching certification. Four of the seven teacher education institutions reported that they had increased their efforts to recruit students. At the same time, the survey estimated that 1,023 additional teachers will be required by 1992. The study concluded that teacher education programs will have to make more and better efforts at recruitment and that a national task force should work on averting a crisis. Other recommendations included changes in teacher education programs and re-certification programs for science teachers and others. (KC)",

Given the long history of unsuccessful attempts to improve the quality and scope of data on vocational education, it is important to understand the lessons of the past before embarking on a new data collection effort mandated by reauthorization efforts for the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act. This paper seeks to improve future efforts to collect and report data on vocational education. It begins by reviewing the history of previous efforts to collect national information on vocational education and then examines why collecting accurate, consistent data has proven so difficult. The specific kinds of information that are needed for national policy  and accountability are discussed next. The five areas involved are governance, student information, staffing, finance, and facilities and equipment. Effective strategies are proposed for collecting this information for each area. Finally, the paper concludes with some recommendations for federal policy. (KC)",

        "description":"Over the past decade, research by cognitive scientists has been building a clearer understanding of how people learn in school and out. A review of the various streams of cognitive research has implications for vocational education. Research has determined characteristics of effective workers and how people become effective workers. Some highlights of this research are that (1) the usual teaching of skill hierarchies is seldom effective in educating and training for work; (2) people build workplace expertise through the opportunity to participate, under the training of experts, in physical and intellectual tasks specific to a particular work setting; (3) the abstract thinking skills required in many technical jobs today are learned effectively through a combination of practice  and explicit teaching in a meaningful context; and (4) impediments to providing the opportunity to participate in meaningful work experiences include the increasing emphasis on school-based, formal education, the insistence on sequential learning of skill hierarchies and general reasoning skills without application to practice, and the increasing complexity of jobs, which makes craft-style apprenticeship ineffective. To improve education for work, vocational education needs to integrate learning of basic skills with learning of specific work setting skills, to provide education for work in replications of work situations, and to recognize the relationship between healthy families, schools that educate, and productive workplaces. Over 100 references are cited and a list of 20 researchers  consulted is appended. (KC)",

In contrast, the Japanese subjects were found to believe more strongly that close friendships outside of marriage would have harmful effects on marriage. Nevertheless, the Japanese subjects tended to believe more strongly that husbands should  socialize with co-workers after work rather than go home to be with the family, if such socialization would facilitate career advancement. Neither group was supportive of employed wives/mothers socializing with co-workers rather than being with their family. (Author)",

Most findings were based on assessments of personality after marriage, thus confounding the effects of marriage on personality. This study was conducted to examine congruence between spouses' personality assessed prior to marriage with the status of the marriage after 3 to 5 years of marriage. Subjects were 72 couples between the ages of 16 and 19 who were referred to a church-affiliated counseling agency prior to obtaining permission from that church to marry. Each partner completed the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF) prior to obtaining permission to marry. Seven of the 16 personality dimensions of the 16PF have  been identified as being predictive of marital status: sizothymia/affectothymia, intelligence, ego weakness/strength, submissiveness/dominance. desurgency/surgency, alaxia/protension, and conservatism/radicalism. These seven dimensions were examined using intraclass and multivariate analyses. The findings clearly suggest a relation between personality assessed prior to marriage and marital instability. Spouses in marriages characterized as stable tended to be similar in intelligence, protension, and radicalism. Spouses in unstable marriages differed in warmth and outgoingness, while being similar in intelligence. (Author/NB)",

Data were obtained through structured interviews with 88 sixth-graders. A taxonomy of nine conflict categories was developed from spontaneous reports of friendship conflicts. The salience in early adolescence of 12 common sources of friendship conflicts suggested by the literature was assessed.  Responses to two hypothetical social problem-solving dilemmas were coded for social-cognitive developmental level based on Selman's (1984) Interpersonal Negotiation Strategies Interview. The findings revealed gender differences: girls' friendships appeared to be more exclusive, committed, and concerned with issues of trust, intimacy, and aspects of the emotional connection than were friendships of boys. Boys' expressed friendship concerns seemed more focused on issues dealing with autonomy and individuality. Higher social-cognitive developmental levels were associated with higher self-perceived social skills and self-esteem. (NB)",

The groups were matched on age, education range, marital status, and race. Factor analyses of the eight MCMI personality subscales for the two groups revealed three factors for each group, accounting for 80% of the variance in each group. For the batterer sample, the three factors derived were borderline/schizoidal, histrionic/narcissistic, and antisocial/narcissistic. The three factors derived for nonbatterers were avoidant, antisocial/narcissistic, and passive/aggressive. Further analyses revealed that the  two groups were qualitatively different on all but one factor for each group. Between-group analyses on the eight subscales between factor 2 nonviolent men and factor 3 batterers indicated that the batterer group scored higher than the nonbatterer group on avoidant, aggressive, and negativistic subscales and lower on the conforming subscale. In general, nonviolent men were more highly represented in the narcissistic/aggressive factor while batterers were more highly represented in the avoidant/negativistic factor. These findings suggest that there are both qualitative and quantitative differences in personality characteristics of domestically violent and nonviolent men. (NB)",

Subjects were 127 fifth graders who completed questionnaires assessing attributional style, sex role identity, and computer and video game experience. Several weeks later, subjects used either a frustrating or non-frustrating computer program to solve anagrams, evaluated their performance, and made attributions for their performance. Also assessed were anxiety, attitudes toward the  program, perceptions of anagrams, perceptions of one's own ability with computers, expectations for future performance, attitudes toward using computers in the future, and performance on a second computer program. The findings revealed that both boys and girls were enthusiastic about using computers and had positive attitudes toward computers, yet girls used computers less often than boys did, and girls felt that they had less ability with computers than did boys. None of the three possible explanations for sex differences in computer use and attitudes could adequately account for the results. (NB)",

Data were drawn from a research project to explore these and other related variables in a major northeastern University. Subjects (N=240), randomly selected from each of seven campus subpopulations (the four undergraduate levels, graduate students, faculty, and staff) were mailed survey questionnaires that assessed: (1) potentially predisposing risk factors, such as demographics, alcohol knowledge, peer usage and pressure, alcohol and drug availability, motivations for drinking, mood, and place of residence; (2) level of respondent's alcohol use; (3)  type and frequency of respondent's drug use; and (4) high risk behavior associated with substance use, including driving under the influence and unprotected sexual intercourse. Results, summarized and tabulated, suggest that alcohol and drug use, and associated risk-taking behaviors, vary considerably with both age and social environment, suggesting the influence of campus peer subcultures. Thus it might be productive to concentrate prevention and intervention efforts on identified high-risk peer subcultures, involving peer leaders and peer counseling programs in efforts to modify peer group norms.

In support of the hypothesis, poor constructive thinkers reacted to the stress with a greater increase in negative thoughts and negative emotions, and exhibited a greater increase in blood pressure and other measures of physiological arousal than did good constructive thinkers. Examination of thought patterns indicated that poor constructive thinkers did not differ from good constructive thinkers in positive thinking, but did differ in some aspects of negative thinking. It was concluded that an increased number of physical symptoms reported by poor constructive thinkers may be mediated by the increased stress produced by their  maladaptive thinking style. (Author)",

This shift reflects a change both in the &quot;moral climate&quot; regarding drug use as well as a reconception of the appropriate way to confront the issue--the &quot;just say no&quot; philosophy. This paper first provides a sociological overview of the emergence of adolescent drug use as a major social problem. Next, through an examination of government-sponsored literature on drug use produced over the past 10 years, it documents the changes in conceptual focus that have occurred during this time, and it considers some of the potentially adverse consequences of these changes. Finally, a redefinition of the notion of &quot;drug-free school&quot; is proposed.  (TE)",

        "description":"Despite recent efforts to encourage federal funding of psychological services for underserved populations such as the elderly and residents of rural areas, ample evidence suggests that rural areas are underserved by psychologists. Drawing on data from rural and urban areas in Pennsylvania, this paper argues that master's level training can provide a means for filling significant gaps in psychological services, especially in rural areas, which are not currently filled by doctoral-level providers. Despite the profession's opposition to subdoctoral training for practitioners, the National Institute of Mental Health in the mid-1980s supported several master's programs with specific rural training goals, but such funding was terminated by the Reagan Administration. As a consequence,  the present trends in both federal policy and the training and licensing of psychologists will lead to a large number of rural areas lacking access to even minimum levels of psychological services. The psychological profession should therefore recognize and support various levels of complementary psychological functions, so that appropriately supervised high quality psychological services could more readily be provided to rural communities.

Based on results from this sample, a 15-item LVIAS was developed that discriminated students with extremely low vocational identity from students with average and above scores on the VIS. Students with extremely low vocational identity tended to identify with negative experiences with at least one teacher in high school, self- and parental perceptions of students' lack of maturity, a tense home atmosphere during the grade school years, strict and overprotective parents during grade school years, homemaker mothers,  special attention to grades early in school career, students living in a highly populated environment during grade school years, family annual income of under $40,000, a lack of higher educational attainment among both parents, a lower evaluation of one's grade schools, parental pressure to excel in junior high schools, a tendency to enjoy studying, and the experience of a death in the immediate family. Students who identify with at least 7 of the 15 LVIAS life history events may be at risk of extremely low vocational identity.

This presentation accordingly evaluates some of the assumptions of the literature on quality circles and suggests ways in which social psychology research can make quality circles a more viable team performance strategy. While voluntary, democratically controlled, participatory quality circles work well in Japan, with its traditions of lifetime employment and group loyalty, they are less successful among Americans, who are more oriented toward their personal career goals, and who are motivated more by a sense of individual responsibility. For this population, participation in quality  circles is therefore likely to be more successful if it is either mandatory or a path toward individual advancement, with a clear agenda set by facilitative leaders who are higher in the organization, in which the focus is on measurable accomplishments and workers are empowered to act on their own suggestions.

Yet the problem of teenage pregnancy is most frequently overlooked by rural and small school communities. In fact, some cultural factors and resource deficiencies of these communities actually facilitate early pregnancy. The emotional, educational, and medical effects of teenage parenting are particularly serious for our society as a whole. The problems involved with teenage parenting must be recognized and comprehensively and holistically addressed by our society. Solving these problems in sparsely populated rural communities that typically have conservative attitudes toward sex education is an exciting challenge. Comprehensive  efforts designed to enhance student self-esteem and to provide sex education; career, health, academic and mental health counseling; and alternate social activities, and that facilitate parent-child communication will prevent most teenage pregnancies. These efforts will strengthen the physical, mental, and economic health of the rural community involved. The project planning and implementation process itself will strengthen the sense of community.

        "description":"While female victims of sexual abuse have received increased attention, male victims continue to be overlooked. Recognition of effects of sexual abuse has been an important step in increasing identification of and treatment for victims of abuse. To assess the characteristics of male victims, sexually abused male (N=13) and female (N=16) adolescents were compared with a contrast group of junior and senior high school students (N=35). Subjects completed psychometric tests assessing clinical syndromes along with subjects' drive or need levels on various characteristics. Compared with the contrast group, sexually abused adolescents perceived life to be more meaningless, perceived less control over their lives, experienced more depression, lacked self-efficacy, and reported less trust  of others, among other characteristics. Importantly, few differences were found between male and female abused adolescents, suggesting that the experience and consequences of abuse may not be significantly different for males and females. There clearly is a need for more extensive research to examine the potential differences between sexually abuse males and females. The course of treatment may be different for males and females since males will express their distress differently, with males being more external and females more internal. (Author/ABL)",

Chapters 4 through 9 focus on high school seniors, providing data on prevalence and trends in drug use, use at earlier levels, degree and duration of drug highs, attitudes  and beliefs about drugs, and the social milieu for seniors. Chapters 10 through 13 cover the prevalence, trends, attitudes, and social milieu of post-high school young adults, while chapters 14 and 15 focus on prevalence and trends in drug use among college students. Chapter 16 provides other findings from the study, including the use of nonprescription stimulants, daily marijuana use, and data correlating drug use with other factors.

Current trends in the preparation of school counselors include (1) 2-year, full-time master's degree in school counseling with a supervised internship in the schools for one full academic term; (2) separate specialty courses for elementary, middle, and secondary school counselors; and (3) increased emphasis on group guidance, group counseling, and  preventive interventions, particularly at the elementary level.

According to the model, the five stages of adult interpersonal development are: (1) Social Relatedness versus Self-Insistence, or need for Approval; (2) Affiliation versus Exclusion, or need for Affiliation; (3) Belonging versus Alienation, or need for Belongingness; (4) Intimacy versus Isolation, or need for Intimacy; and (5) Interdependence versus Interpersonal Constriction, or need for Reciprocity. Interview data were scored for the subject's orientation to relationships, nature of interpersonal interactions, and interpersonal need. The present study examined in more depth the  qualitative nature and process of interpersonal development in young adulthood from this same sample. Questions were raised regarding the characteristics of interpersonal development in young adults, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, as well as the factors which may contribute to change in interpersonal development over time. Results generally support a developmental conception of interpersonal relatedness in young adulthood as involving a progressive sequence of transformations in the qualitative nature of interpersonal relationships.

It is suggested that the clinician's position of mandatory reporting is an unrealistic response in many cases of elder abuse due to the lack of adequate support services for either the abuser or the elder. Outcome studies are used to support this suggestion. A brief review of policy on this issue charts the decreasing funds available for services. Constitutional rights of elders and infantilization through mandated reporting are addressed. The suggestion is made to policymakers and clinicians to concentrate their efforts not on finding cases of abuse, but rather doing something once they are found. (Author)",

Invitational learning is a paradigm for personal and professional functioning, and for organizational restructuring, based on four values regarding the nature of people and their potential and the nature of professional helping: respect, trust, optimism, and intentionality. Part I of the book develops the theory of invitational learning in five chapters which: define invitational learning (chapter 1); discuss foundations of invitational learning (chapter 2); identify four levels of functioning (chapter 3); explore the five &quot;powerful P's&quot; of places, policies, programs, processes, and people (chapter 4); and explain the &quot;Four Corner Press&quot; of being  personally and professionally inviting with oneself and others (chapter 5). Part II surveys the practice of invitational learning through seven essays by separate authors describing their experience in institutions or programs that employ the invitational learning model: (1) &quot;The Baltimore County Guidance and Counseling Experience&quot; (Donald E. McBrien); (2) &quot;The Furman University Center for Excellence Experience&quot; (Judy Lehr); (3) &quot;The East Davidson High School Experience&quot; (Debbie Chance); (4) &quot;The Kansas Elementary School Curriculum Experience&quot; (John H.

        "description":"A study was conducted to answer the question, &quot;What are the basic words in a list of words kindergarten through sixth grade students will frequently encounter in their reading?&quot; The study was limited to the words the students would encounter in their textbooks (including basals). A corpus of 7,230 words was then analyzed by two raters to determine those that were basic. The major finding was that out of 7,230 high frequency words, 5,084 were found to be basic. The study also indicated that there are identifiable high frequency basic words that can be used as a tool for classroom instruction. Specifically, the 5,084 words identified in the study appear quite frequently in the content-related materials students will commonly encounter in their reading. The study of suffixes  indicates that instruction in their use might be most effective if it focused on those that change basic words to noun forms. It would also appear useful to provide students with an awareness of the dynamics of change along the concrete/abstract and specific/general dimensions. (Three tables of data are included.) (MG)",

A study examined the reading achievement effects of &quot;group assisted reading,&quot; a teaching strategy designed to assist poor readers to read difficult material, in which the teacher assisted a group of students to read text material in unison--emphasizing correct phrasing, intonation, and pitch. Subjects were randomly selected from the population of poor readers in the third grade in one elementary school in a low socioeconomic district in Utah; 18 received the  group assisted reading treatment and the control group (also 18 students) received unassisted reading treatment. One teacher taught both groups of students in &quot;pull-out&quot; sessions over an eight-week period (40 school days, 15 minutes a day). A pretest-posttest control group research design was used. Reading comprehension and vocabulary were measured using the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test, Level C, Form 1. Results indicated that students involved in the group assisted reading experiment made greater achievement gains on reading comprehension and vocabulary than those who were given no assistance.

        "description":"This report discusses how reading instruction should be modified to facilitate the development of comprehension strategies in all children (including those labeled as &quot;at-risk&quot; or &quot;disadvantaged&quot;). Current theoretical views of reading comprehension do not support a discrete skills perspective, but classroom research has documented the influence of basal reading programs on elementary reading instruction. Current views of reading suggest that readers are involved in a recursive search for meaning in which they deploy their own knowledge in concert with perceptions from the text and context to create a dynamic interpretation. In the search for an appropriate instructional model, four delivery models were reviewed: direct instruction, explicit instruction, cognitive apprenticeship,  and whole language; none, however, were found capable of providing the appropriate delivery system for a comprehension focus. Based on this review, a consensus model of instruction, incorporating features of each model that are appropriate for designing instruction for low-achieving students, is delineated. It includes (1) teacher modeling, to let students in on the secrets; (2) task and text authenticity, to ensure purposefulness; (3) scaffolding, to cope with complexity; and (4) shared decision making, to develop self assessment. This approach to reading instruction requires teachers to move away from the &quot;teacher-proof&quot; model frequently offered in conventional programs to a model in which they make most decisions within their classrooms.

Subjects, 106 third-grade children from 2 middle-sized Illinois cities were randomly assigned to 4 experimental groups and 1 control group. Their comprehension was measured with free and probed story recall after a 3-week unit of instruction in which questions focused on prediction or review were asked in the experimental groups while control group questions came from the basal series' teacher manuals containing the experimental stories. Results of mixed hierarchical analyses indicated that justifying answers significantly improved the performance of groups asked prediction questions but not groups asked review questions. Results also  indicated a nonsignificant trend toward superior performance of the experimental groups over the control group, suggesting that importance and explicitness of ideas are appropriate foci in designing discussion questions.

The book describes the constructive nature of children's thinking, reading, and writing, and the natural development of these processes. Chapter 1 discusses a model of literacy learning and the role of teachers in creating sound literacy programs for their pupils. Chapters 2 and 3 present instructional ideas that support the literacy development of middle grade students. Chapter two centers on developing  readers; some of the topics covered include reading aloud, literature sets, reading conferences, book talks, strategy lessons, and reading journals and logs. Chapter 3 focuses on developing writers and discusses various aspects of the writing workshop, writing outside the workshop, and assessment of writing--only those ideas which are consistent with a whole language view of literacy development have been included. Chapter 4 comments on specific questions about the whole language approach to reading and writing.

Subjects, 119 fourth and fifth grade students in a large city school system (66 subjects receiving remedial instruction in an in-class setting and 53 in a pullout setting), were observed systematically over a four-month period while receiving reading instruction from their remedial reading specialists. Results indicated that: (1) setting, as it was implemented in this district, had an impact on how remedial reading specialists organized lessons, on what students experienced, and on the behaviors of the students within that setting; (2) congruence between the curriculum and instruction of developmental teachers and reading specialists was greater in the in-class  than pullout programs, although the nature and extent varied greatly within the various in-class settings; (3) across both settings, the reading program appeared to be similar to what could be called a traditional skills-focused curriculum; and (4) none of the instructional variables that were hypothesized to predict reading achievement reached statistical significance. Findings suggest that although the nature of instruction did not appear to influence achievement, there were differences in the amount of total instructional time and in instructional behaviors, lesson focus, and reading behaviors experienced by the students in the in-class or pullout programs.

        "description":"Comprehension instruction must engage students in strategic behaviors over an extended period of time. These extended encounters are necessary to allow students to internalize the strategy and gain sufficient efficiency with the new procedure to justify its continued use. Unfortunately, teacher training programs often reinforce a notion of teaching that works against in-depth comprehension instruction. In the context of undergraduate reading methods courses, a program was designed to provide preservice teachers with the experience of learning a new strategy in an instructional setting and the experience of applying the strategy to aid comprehension. One particular form of comprehension instruction (reciprocal teaching) was adopted for sustained focus. The preservice classes were  divided into groups of from four to six students. The groups practiced reciprocal teaching simultaneously. The class's experiences during instruction are reflected in a sample transcript of the group's discussion and journal entries describing the students' reaction to the procedure. The journal entries reflect a generally positive experience with the reciprocal teaching procedure, but laced with the difficulties and frustrations inherent in learning a new cognitive strategy. The transcript shows developing competence with the form of the interaction and the use of the component strategy. Designing and implementing this type of instruction require experience in learning and using strategies and are not enhanced by instruction in which such strategies are merely &quot;mentioned.&quot;  (RS)",

Especially useful are examples from Reading Recovery, a successful literacy training program. Some of the maxims include: (1) instruction should use a whole-to-part approach; (2) instruction should be rooted in authentic, real world situations; (3) instruction should foster flexibility through multiple perspectives; (4) instruction should be sensitive to the developmental progression of students; (5) instruction should assume an action orientation; (6) instruction should involve modeling; (7) instruction should involve coaching; (8)  instruction should involve scaffolding; and (9) instruction should foster reflection and articulation. The great irony of teacher education appears to be that prospective teachers are taught in ways that are inconsistent with the maxims of effective learning and instruction. An experimental preservice education course at the University of Illinois illustrates on a small scale how the maxims developed can be applied to teacher education. (RS)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to evaluate the impact of predictable stories given to children from low-income families over a two-year period. Phase one subjects were all the children (N=52) from four Headstart classes; phase two subjects were all the children who had participated in phase 1 and who entered kindergarten after their last year in Headstart. The children were assigned to experimental and alternative groups; the remaining children were placed in the control group. The experimental group received six predictable stories during Headstart and six during kindergarten to read at home. The control group received pictures of six familiar children's stories during Headstart and six sets of workbook activities during kindergarten. Both groups received six lessons to learn about the  materials during the Headstart year. In May of the Headstart and kindergarten years, children were given spelling and reading subtests and were asked to read old and new stories. Parents completed questionnaires regarding their child's use of the materials that had been sent to their homes and their child's interest in these materials and their knowledge about reading and writing. Results indicated that the experimental group scored significantly higher on story reading, word reading, and spelling. Teachers reported that a significantly higher number of children from the control group might have problems with reading when they began first grade. Parents of the experimental group rated their children significantly higher on questions concerning their child's interest in and knowledge about  reading and writing than did the parents of the control group. Findings suggest that predictable stories encourage children to behave like readers at home and that this at-home activity influences early reading development. (Eight tables of data including a detailed analysis of responses to the parent questionnaire are included and 38 references are attached.) (Author/MG)",

Common sense does not simply entail some shared cognitive facility that enables people to perceive the world in similar ways; it entails a learned and considered response to the world. Taking common sense seriously means that young journalists should come to appreciate the fundamental &quot;immethodicalness&quot;, as Geertz called it, of humanity's unassuming efforts to make sense of the world. Accepting common sense as a legitimate and viable system of thought can reclaim epistemology from its reduction to methodology and can  therefore honor what inevitably shapes everyday knowledge, including journalists' knowledge of news: social practice. Treating news and journalists' knowledge of it in terms of common sense can recapture the realities of journalism and present those realities in a historical and cultural context that can bring to reporting and newswriting courses the kind of intellectual adventure they seldom engender.

The three kinds of metaphor used in the study varied in whether the shared information forming the basis for the interpretation was attributional, relational, or both. In the first experiment, 10 five-year-olds, 10 nine-year-olds, and 10 college students enrolled in psychology classes, produced interpretations of the three types of metaphors. The attributionality and relationality of their interpretations were scored by independent judges. In the second experiment, 36 adult undergraduates, 18 four-year-olds, and 18 seven-year-olds chose which of two interpretations (relational or  attributional) of metaphor they preferred. In both experiments, results indicated that relational responding increased significantly with age, but attributional responding did not. Findings suggest a developmental shift toward a focus on relational structure in metaphor interpretation.

Analysis of the history of the test since its inception in 1876 shows long periods of disuse and several recent instances of inconsistent use and of misue of the courts. A detailed examination of the arguments of Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter in the case of Shelton v. Tucker (1960) reveals that those arguments contained the seeds of two major challenges to the least restrictive means test: (1) that the judiciary should defer to legislative rationality; and (2) that statutes should be  judged solely in terms of their effects rather than being called unconstitutional per se. A third challenge stemmed from the Court's identification of a classification system for forums of communication, which determined that the test should be applied only to communication articulated in quasi-public or &quot;quintessentially&quot; public forums. While standards like the least restrictive means test can theoretically insure constitutional rights, vigilant analysis and criticism of the uses of such tests is necessary to the survival of such rights.

Communication research suggests a biological basis for certain patterns of adult interaction. Although these patterns of interaction do not exhaust all or even the most important aspects of human interaction, there is ample evidence that they are functionally important to the adult and to the infant-adult relationship. The patterns of interaction may even be the mechanism for defining caretaker-infant bonding. An appreciation of the intricate relationship between social and biological behavior and the common biological bases of human communication  is one result of looking for the biological sources of ultimate causation for patterns of human communication. The emphasis on learning, culture, and socialization, the emphasis on higher-level cognitive processes and on highly deliberate linguistic exchanges have had a central place in the study of human communication. But it is time to recognize that part of what makes communication human is its biological commonness across peoples and even species. (One hundred-and-two references are attached.) (RS)",

President Jimmy Carter and the Ayatollah Khomeini were portrayed by ABC as potentially able to bring order to the situation but failing to do so. Americans were described as &quot;frustrated&quot; and &quot;outraged,&quot; and their reactions shown as contrasting sharply with the Carter Administration's measured approach, were contrasted with the Carter Administration's measured approach, which was portrayed as being based on  principles and high morals. The meaning of the crisis came to be summarized in ABC coverage as a test of the strength, image, and power of the United States. The analysis shows that events were considered for their symbolic value even more than for their pragmatic effects. Power became critically tied to image, and the possibility of American military action came to be viewed from the perspective of what message it would send to Iran and of the American unity it would reflect. Such attempts to label events based upon predisposed ideas, expectations, and limited knowledge prevent Americans from seeing the realities of given situations. (Eighty-five notes are included.)

        "description":"From a Vygotskian perspective critical thinking skills are taught through speech interactions between teacher and student. Two assumptions central to Vygotskian theory are the role of inner speech in self-regulation and how teaching creates the zone of proximal development. Inner speech allows humans to consciously direct their thought processes. Critical thinking is a psychological system that involves the collaboration of several higher mental functions including memory, conceptual thought, analysis, synthesis, evaluation, and even imagination. Written texts and peer tutors can be used to teach additional critical thinking skills, but alone they are not sufficient--the teacher-student interaction is the key. The different instructional modes (lecture, the recitation script,  Socratic questioning, informal lecture/discussion, open discussion, and independent study) represent different levels of teacher control of learning and are different ways of providing scaffolding in the zone of proximal development. Four stages of learning in the zone of proximal development are conversations with the teacher, private speech, inner speech, and then deautomatization when conversation is again sought out. Vygotsky believed that critical thinking skills are culturally relative and are learned, and used, within a social-historical context. This perspective is a useful way of organizing the disparate lines of research on critical thinking. It also offers interesting strategies for teaching critical thinking which can be evaluated empirically. (One table outlining levels of  control in teacher directions is included.) (MG)",

        "description":"A research review examined the ethical responsibilities of a communicator in contemporary American society, particularly in governmental communication. Various scholars have suggested standards of ethical governmental communication and have questioned the ethics of governmental officials in several cases. Ethical analysis of President Ronald Reagan's rhetoric by Green and MacColl (1983), for example, shows a speaker considered &quot;negligent or reckless&quot; with the truth. Presidents Ford and Nixon's discourse has also received attention from communication ethics scholars. Scholars have identified several criteria of ethical governmental communication. Among these criteria are avoidance of the following: misrepresentation in the use of evidence and in the assertion of expertise;  deception in the statement of governmental purpose; misuse of the practice of classifying documents; and criticism of the press to assure that governmental acts are viewed only in favorable terms. The philosopher Sissela Bok's view is that a governmental practice of telling minor lies in times of crisis can expand into what Bok calls &quot;vast practices where the harm to be averted is less obvious.&quot; Another scholar suggests that to fail to keep abreast of public issues or to accept unacceptable answers from officials is to abdicate the responsibilities of citizenship.

To test the hypotheses of the original study and to explore questions about using the polarization index as an indication of group cohesiveness, the study used a large number of groups, an additional formula for calculating polarization intensity, two additional measures of group cohesiveness, and an additional evaluation of group output as a measure of group effectiveness. Subjects were students (N=248) enrolled in a multi-section course in small group communications at a large midwestern university. Subjects self-selected themselves into groups of no less than three and no more than seven and participated in five  hours of introductory interaction. After this, they were asked to develop and present two exercises on group communication topics. Results revealed that neither polarization nor unification is an adequate measure of group cohesion and that a factor other than cohesiveness accounts for group effectiveness. Findings suggest that group effectiveness is more dependent upon feelings of satisfaction than on feelings of cohesiveness. Continued investigations into individual members of the work group and their definitions of group and personal effectiveness appear to be called for.

Ninety-six respondents participated in the study either through an oral survey or a follow-up questionnaire administered at two different national tournaments. The subjects included the directors of forensics, the coach in attendance, and five students unaccompanied by a coach. Respondents provided factors influencing their decisions to attend particular national tournaments which were grouped into 10 reasons: manner of qualification, availability of funding, quality of the tournament, tradition of attending the tournament, location of the tournament, professional affiliation of the coach or program, educational value of  participating in the tournament, preference of the students involved, time when the tournament was held, and enjoyment of the coach and students when attending the tournament. Conclusions suggested that while the national tournaments sponsored by forensic honorary organizations ranked second most preferred, the reasons why they might be preferred (tradition, professional affiliation of the coach and/or program, educational value, preference of the student, and enjoyment) were not among the reasons identified.

Topics which have been taught include: basic public speaking skills; oral reading; listening; creative expression and storytelling; speaking with a purpose; communication etiquette; and speaking and working in groups. A unit on debate was also introduced and widely accepted. Four areas of debate were identified as being most important for children to understand: debate format; asking questions and responding to questions in debate; the use of evidence in debate; and practicing the art of debate. Each of these areas was divided into six lessons or activities. At the  end of the month the parents came to listen to their children debate and were very pleased that their children could master the debate concepts. The children were praised for what they accomplished individually and competition was not stressed. By starting debate at an early age, children can invest time and energy to learn and master some of the basic concepts of the activity. The two key factors involved in offering debate for children are (1) finding a teacher who is intrested in the activity and (2) locating a curriculum that is appropriate.

The first section, a short discussion of assessing speaking and listening, includes information about definitions, taxonomies of skills, issues in validity and reliability, the current state-of-the-art in assessing speaking and listening, and what to consider when selecting an assessment tool. The second section contains descriptions and reviews of assessment tools, providing longer  reviews for instruments that are readily accessible, that measure some aspect of &quot;communication competence,&quot; and that have some technical information available. These longer reviews are evaluative and include descriptions of the purpose(s) the author sees for the assessment instrument; content (tasks, response modes, and scoring procedures); reliability; validity studies; amount of help with interpretation and use; and source. The second section also presents short reviews of research instruments, achievement test series, instruments developed by educational agencies and instruments lacking technical investigation. The final section lists additional resources available to the user such as print resources and professional organizations.

Canonical discriminant functions revealed that the  subjects clearly distinguished between adept and inept communicators. Classification results revealed that nearly 97% of the cases were classified correctly.

Even among its strongest proponents, confusion about its essential character and ultimate applications in applied communication technology exist. Well before the advent of broadcasting and the particular regulatory measures adopted for it, American public policy had established an accommodation between public and private interests that turned largely around the economic well-being of the industries and the assumption that public service benefits would derive most  fully from that relationship. The evidence from the long prior experience of state and federal regulatory policy is that the public interest standard had been developing as a key doctrine in American economic and social policy for nearly a century. It was upon that platform that much of the political and industrial policy for the new broadcast law would be erected. Many of the implicit understandings about the public interest in the previous experience would now migrate into the new order, and in spite of continuing confusions about the matter, then and now, the underlying significance of the public interest standard would likewise be transferred into the new broadcast communications realm.

A total of 17 one-hour episodes and 24 half-hour episodes were obtained, yielding 41 programs or 29 total hours of televised interaction. Programs were classified as either drama, situation comedy, or night time soap. Primary characters were involved in a total of 255 conflict situations across 41 episodes of prime time television. Situations involving jealousy, envy, or rivalry were less frequent than conflict, yet still common with a total of 88 instances of these predicaments depicted. Results indicated  that family conflict and the expression of jealousy are quite common in prime time television relationships and predominantly depicted in a prosocial manner across situation comedies, family dramas, and night time soaps. Gender differences were prevalent within the televised interaction patterns. Results suggest that television portrayal of conflictual interaction presents a mixed bag of potential effects. While a prosocial model for mothers and wives responding to their husbands is presented, siblings, wives initiating conflict, and husbands in general are depicted as using antisocial styles of conflictual interaction. With regard to the portrayal of jealousy, envy, and rivalry, findings indicated that a romantic involvement is the greatest threat to the jealous person; envy was most  often over another's relationship; and rivalry most frequently occurred to obtain a \"person\".

        "description":"A model intended to overcome the cultural relativism of determining what is an ethical act draws an analogy to environmental studies. Beginning with the concepts of &quot;telos&quot; (final purpose) and &quot;archai&quot; (priority), the notion of an ecosystem of ethics avoids limitation to a particular historical definition of good. Since the telos of human life is the quest for the good, a communicative ecosystem's virtues are those which enable its members to seek the good. An ideal communicative system supports all parts equally, and the parts in turn support the system. The telos of the individual and of the system are interrelated; both must be taken into account in making ethical decisions. The practice of living ethically will include system building and transforming. How to help the present  system become more like the ideal without making the system less viable is the central question. Combining the notions of public and private into a systems relationship should increase understanding of the problem of morality, but also will raise new inquiries. (Twenty-five notes are included.)

The cultural change was measured through a triangulation approach combining questionnaires, interview data and direct observation. Pre- and post-intervention data were obtained in the two-year study from 243 employees of a governmental organization in the Pacific Northwest. A representative sample was interviewed and subjects completed the Organizational Culture Scale, which provides quantitative data in teamwork/conflict, supervision, involvement, climate/morale, information flow, and meetings. Additionally, subjects were directly observed in the work context. Results revealed that the organization changed  significantly with regard to information flow, involvement, climate/morale, and meetings. Findings suggest that the aspects of intervention which seem to have the greatest input on culture change are communication skills training for the entire organization, involvement in decision making, and establishment of task teams.

Specifically, the wording of the scale was examined. Operating under the principle that the use of the process word &quot;arguing&quot; and the product word &quot;argument,&quot; as well as mention of issues or failure to mention issues affects responses to the scale, four versions of the scale were created. The four versions were consistently worded to reflect: (1) arguing over issues; (2) argument; (3) argument over issues; and (4) arguing. Findings demonstrated that versions that referred to issues differed from versions that did not mention issues. Further, versions that mentioned issues differed from the original Argumentativeness Scale. One possible  explanation for the findings was that the mention of issues addresses content, while failure to mention issues causes most respondents to believe the item is referring to relational arguments. Findings suggest that further refinement of the argumentativeness operationalization should be addressed. (Two tables of data are included, and 28 references are attached.) (SR)",

A study used fantasy-theme analysis of print news coverage (news stories, editorials, letters to the editor, and editorial cartoons) of the events in Iran to identify the motivations of journalists and their audiences in attending to the events and coverage of them. The study found evidence supporting journalists' assertions that they cover events because of their &quot;newsworthiness&quot; to audiences, and supporting the assertion that news has an inherently rhetorical dimension. The study also examined motives of the American public influencing  Ronald Reagan's victory over Jimmy Carter in 1980, and how news coverage contributed to this outcome. Finally, the study suggests the dangerous foreign policy environment established when a democratic state's journalists cover foreign news in the fashion they covered the events in Iran.

        "description":"A study tested the prediction that men's and women's relative responses to the Argumentativeness Scale will change if the items are worded consistently so as to make more or less salient the content and process dimensions of arguing. Respondents, 564 students enrolled in basic public speaking courses at Ball State University, were each provided with a demographic survey, the verbal aggressiveness scale, one of five differently worded versions of the Argumentativeness Scale, and four three-item semantic differential items. Results indicated that rewording the items produced significantly different scores. Results regarding sex differences were also consistent with the recurring problem of different definitions of &quot;argument&quot; and with the predictions of the study. Findings confirmed  the prediction that debaters' and nondebaters' scores would not be significantly different on forms that mention issues but that they would differ on forms that did not mention issues. Findings suggest that the Argumentativeness Scale may need to be modified in order to make it a valid operationalization of the argumentativeness construct conceived by Dominic Infante and Andrew Rancer. Evidence was provided that Form Four may measure trait argumentativeness much better than the current scale. Future research will attempt to confirm this tentative conclusion.

Program grants, known as &quot;cost-sharing awards,&quot; were matched with state funding and were intended to generate new knowledge on educational topics of interest to state legislatures. This final report describes the cost-sharing awards program, examines its outcomes, discusses its strengths and weaknesses, and makes recommendations regarding the future of such programs. To obtain a grant award, states had to go through a competitive application process with strict eligibility, selection, supervision, and  reporting requirements. A questionnaire sent to the 69 project directors near the end of the project solicited respondents' feedback regarding program intentions, outcomes, benefits, and improvements. The program allowed states to enhance their legislative studies by involving experts, conducting more indepth research, and leveraging additional funds for research. Top choices for future study areas included educational finance and equity, education reform, and higher education finance and organization. Program strengths and weaknesses are summarized, along with individual state outcomes and recommendations for making future programs even more worthwhile and cost-effective. Appendices contain a categorized list of studies, the evaluation questionnaire, and the program evaluation analysis.  (MLH)",

As a result, administrative boards acquired fewer regulatory and more informative, activating, and investigative duties. This paper describes the relationships of three national administrative boards, viz, the National Board of Education (NBE), the National Board of Health and Welfare, and the National Board of Education (NBE), the National Board of Health and Welfare, and the National Board of Universities and Colleges with the Government and the Rikdag. All three have comprehensive national statistics at their disposal and have undertaken various types of audits and programs of evaluation but a good deal remains to be  developed. It is observable that central national administration has become more monolithic, a departure from the traditional binary system in which ministries are clearly segregated from administrative boards. The close cooperation established between the Ministry of Education and the NBE corroborates this conclusion. A high level of conflict exists within the NBE Directorate, but this is probably due to the implementation process, and the &quot;common property&quot; character of school affairs. (SI)",

Central to that goal are principals who act as instructional leaders. Drawing upon literature, research, and case studies of principals in practice, the first four of six chapters present a clear portrait of the instructional leader. Principals with very different communication, management, and personal styles can all be strong instructional leaders. Possessing the key qualities of resource provider, instructional resource, communicator, and visible presence, strong instructional leaders spend a substantially greater percentage of time on educational program improvement. Consistent with current  literature on organizational theory and practice, this book emphasizes the importance of the underlying themes and values that hold a system together. Additionally, a clinical supervision model requiring the supervisor to observe the principal in action, to discuss relevant issues and provide feedback, and to develop a plan for the principal's evaluation is provided.

        "description":"For developing nations, education can equalize opportunities, especially for the deprived and disadvantaged, and therefore must be delivered with efficiency and quality. Conventional ways of spreading education are proving to be inadequate in the face of rapidly expanding populations. There is a marked need to supplement formal schooling with nonformal education, distance education, and out-of-school education. Education for the complete person should be the goal. New systems of education must be developed to promote self-reliance, encourage community participation, and strengthen positive humanism for the goals of improving the quality of life and developing peace. A silent revolution in education is taking place all over the world as distance education emerges as an alternative  system. Perhaps the most important group to target are illiterates because their numbers are increasing and because literacy can be linked to vocational education. Through the use of new communications technology, access to good educational programs on most subjects can be greatly extended to large audiences in rural areas. Broadcasting can play a special role in alleviating high unemployment and underemployment, low economic performance, erosion of national cultures and deterioration of national values, the search for peace, the deprivation of opportunities for women, and continuing neglect of the rural disadvantaged. To implement a comprehensive approach to developing distance education in the Philippines, the University of Life can be converted to a National Open University of the  Philippines, acting as a national resource center for distance and nonformal education and a center for educational development and broadcasting. Networks of regional campuses can also be set up. (CML)",

        "description":"This report is a summary of discussions in the fall and winter of 1989-90 in more than 1,700 community forums convened by civic and educational institutions in 47 states. Convenors included colleges and universities, churches, museums and libraries, and local civic and service organizations. The National Issues Forum is the largest ongoing effort in the United States to engage citizens in nonpartisan discussion and debate about pressing domestic issues. The three issues discussed were the drug crisis, the day care dilemma, and threats to the environment. In discussing the drug crisis, there was considerable support for stepped-up interdiction efforts, for expanding domestic law enforcement efforts against drug sellers, for expanded efforts to discourage drug use, and, if  necessary, for aggressive prosecution of drug users. The most widespread concerns in discussing day care were the absence of high-quality child care services, not their cost, and the lack of federal regulations to cover the care of young children. In discussing threats to the environment, those who opposed building more nuclear power plants outnumbered those who favored doing so by a slight margin; roughly three-fourths of the participants favored increasing government funding to spur development of solar energy; and most participants would agree to a tax increase for development of solar energy and to provide additional mass transit in urban areas, in order to reduce air pollution caused by gasoline-fueled vehicles. A directory of convenors is included in the document. (CML)",

The concept of &quot;official languages&quot; contributes to the problem of inadequate literacy skills and to powerlessness. The two factors that appear crucial in reducing the costs of inadequate literacy skills are: (1) increasing public awareness and education regarding literacy; and (2) providing opportunities for learning that are diverse, based on a broad understanding of literacy, and based on principles of equity.

        "description":"Adolescent pregnancy and childbearing rates remain higher in the United States than in most Western nations; more than 500,000 teenage girls have babies every year. As these teen parents mature, they have diminished educational and career expectations. A small number of programs directed toward the career needs of teenage parents was developed during the 1970s and 1980s; many more are needed. The trend is for these programs to share many of the same characteristics of dropout prevention programs. Specific career education components are included, such as assessment of aptitudes, career and vocational counseling, life skills development, preemployment preparation, and job development and placement. In addition, support services such as child care and transportation are provided.  Characteristics of successful programs for teen parents include established sites that can provide services for nontraditional students, support and referral networks, and newsletters. Equity goals must be remembered when developers design programs for teen parents, and teens need to be encouraged to aspire to higher-wage jobs to support themselves and their children. However, gender-role biases need to be addressed. (This fact sheet provides information that can be used in developing programs for teen parents. It includes an annotated list of 14 print resources and addresses of 12 resource organizations that can be contacted for more information.) (KC)",

        "description":"The number of persons confined to correctional institutions continues to grow at an unprecedented rate. Some of the factors contributing to this growth include an increase in the 18- to 25-year-old population, a tougher stance on crime resulting in more prison sentences, longer sentences because younger offenders commit more violent crimes, and more severe sentences for some types of offenders. Education is offered by about 90 percent of correctional institutions, but only about 5 percent of inmates are enrolled in vocational education programs, although 50 percent could benefit from them. Despite its limited availability, vocational education has a long tradition in correctional facilities and is considered to have great potential. However, provision of vocational education is  hampered by lack of funding, inadequate number of programs, outmoded equipment and materials, and limited space. Some studies have documented positive relationships between inmates' participation in vocational education and employment upon release. A newer issue is provision of vocational education to female inmates, a population that has increased 158 percent in the past 10 years. Female inmates have typically had training only in traditional service occupations; female inmates have sued for more opportunities for vocational education in nontraditional fields.

        "description":"Written for the Australian general reader who wants to understand important trends in vocational education and training, this document consists of a description of competency-based training (CBT) and assessment, a short test of readers' CBT understanding, and an annotated bibliography. The introduction states the aims of the document, lists five major steps in the development of CBT programs, and explains that CBT's superiority over traditional methods in bringing employees' skills to required levels is what accounts for its frequent adaptation. The five steps in CBT development are skill identification, organization of the skills into appropriate groups from which learning activities can be developed, development of the physical materials upon which the training program will be  based, staff development, and detailed recordkeeping. The second section defines competence and applies that definition. The third section describes competency-based training programs, including desirable characteristics of such programs. The fourth section addresses the issues surrounding testing for competency, including why it should be done, gathering evidence, articulating standards, the validity and reliability of standards, cost-effectiveness, methods of assessing, recordkeeping, and maintaining standards. The fifth section considers the implications of CBT for employers, teachers, and learners. A short test of readers' understanding of CBT, 27 annotated references, and the answers to the test conclude the document. (CML)",

The Census Bureau's major indicator is number of years of schooling completed. However, average grade-level attainment is high, whereas estimates of levels of reading ability remain low. In addition, these measures are inadequate for adults. A National Assessment of Educational Progress study concluded that although young adults could read and write, too many perform at low levels of proficiency. Increasingly complex definitions of literacy are accompanied by rising literacy standards, although some argue against a national standard definition, because literacy may have different connotations depending on the setting. Particularly in the workplace, the definition of literacy  should be expanded beyond reading and writing to include a continuum of interrelated reasoning and communication skills. (Addresses and telephone numbers are provided for nine people who are sources for definitions of literacy.

Changes in the workplace, particularly the emphasis on problem solving and critical thinking, mean that illiteracy in the workplace is growing. Current school reforms have not yet turned the tide on the illiteracy problem. Economic development in the South is creating a service, not a high-tech economy, with implications for the match between workplace skill needs and systems for delivering education. Strategies for economic development must be multifaceted, but adult  literacy programs must be emphasized in the South. (Addresses and telephone numbers are provided for the seminar presenters.

Why is the GED denigrated as a literacy standard? The military finds GED holders less desirable because their attrition rate is double that of high school graduates. Attrition of GED holders from college courses also appears high. However, this difference may be explained by social and  economic factors. The typical GED holder attends college part time, has family responsibilities, holds a job and is financially independent. (The document includes a list of questions to consider in assessing the GED. Resources for additional information are listed. Outline maps showing minimum ages for test credentials and minimum test scores are included.) (CML)",

The structure of parent-school cooperation must be changed in order to use school resources to help parents become more literate and in turn help their children.

Common evaluation hazards are claiming much and providing evidence of little, selecting measures not logically related to the program, use of grade-equivalent scores, use of different instruments for pretesting and posttesting, and careless collection of data. Evaluations of programs in Philadelphia and Boston found that (1) low-literate adults often have highly developed coping skills and see  little reason to upgrade their literacy level; (2) funding for illiterate adults is difficult to find because sources often expect yearly success rates, sometimes leading programs to accept only the better readers; and (3) quantitative tests tend to be geared to specific skills rather than relevant content.

Perkins Vocational Education Act, Even Start, Job Training Partnership Act, Indian Education Act, Library Services Act, Department of Justice, Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA), Adult Education for the Homeless, Family Support Act, Food Stamp Program, Higher Education Act, and the Workplace Literacy section of the Adult Education Act.

In order to maintain its high recruitment standard, the military relies heavily on a standardized test, the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery. Those who have not graduated from high school or who hold the General Educational Development certificate must have higher than average scores in order to enlist. However, researchers such as Sticht maintain that heavy reliance on literacy tests are unfair to some young people and troublesome for public policy. Sticht contends that these tests exclude many of the most needy young adults from obtaining the benefits of military service, although such tests are imperfect for  determining suitability for the military. Despite recruits with higher literacy skills, remedial literacy programs in the military are increasing. This training emphasizes two strategies--contextual literacy skills (those developed through training in job-related skills) and greater use of technology. Many of the military's research findings and training programs are adaptable to the civilian workplace.

A single standard of literacy is an inadequate measure. The National Assessment of Educational Progress' profile of 3,600 young adults measured three types of literacy: prose (reading and interpretation), document (using tables and charts), and quantitative (performing numerical operations). The study concluded that, among entry workers, (1) relatively small proportions are proficient at moderate or relatively complex tasks; (2) minority groups' scores were generally lower; and (3) the longer the time in school, the higher the literacy proficiency. More information is needed about the literacy levels of occupations. In addition to  literacy, employers are demanding employability, problem-solving, interpersonal, and other skills. Some claim that the future workplace may have even higher requirements. Clearly, present literacy levels are too low to meet even current needs. The following actions are recommended: (1) address information processing skills; (2) expand proficiency measures beyond classroom reading; (3) develop instructional approaches that simulate real experience; and (4) improve evaluation measures by developing employment readiness profiles, conducting longitudinal literacy studies, and analyzing the literacy needs of occupations.

        "description":"This report begins with a review of the literature concerning the effectiveness of Catholic high schools. It then presents new information based on an analysis of the annual nationwide &quot;Monitoring the Future&quot; survey of high school seniors. The survey analysis examines differences between Catholic seniors attending Catholic high schools and those enrolled in public high schools in the areas of social values, educational values, concern for people, at-risk behaviors, perceptions of self, and religiousness. The report examines gender differences, school differences, and 10-year trends in the responses of seniors in Catholic high schools. It discusses the independent effects of various background variables and schooling on a variety of non-academic outcome variables. It concludes  that Catholic schooling, over and above other factors, has a significant and positive effect on student attitudes about militarism, marriage, educational aspiration, likelihood of cutting school, concern for others, frequency of church attendance, and the importance of religion. Catholic high school seniors are described as having somewhat less positive attitudes toward school, an effect that may be due to more rigorous academic demands in Catholic high schools. Other major influences on outcome variables are considered. The report concludes with a discussion of possible explanations for these differences. (Author/NB)",

It reports on Australian and major overseas studies describing community patterns of sexual behavior, with special reference to the period since 1978. It includes a review and analysis of the results of these studies and reports on the reliability and validity of survey results. Comments are made concerning the implications of the survey results for AIDS prevention and community education strategies and programs for both the general  community and specific subgroups (intravenous drug users, bisexual and homosexual males, and adolescents). Sources for the information in this review include commercial polls and sample surveys, work commissioned by governments and their agencies, studies by voluntary agencies, and academic studies. Individual sections of the review focus on: (1) patterns of sexual behavior from the Kinsey reports of 1948 and 1953 to the 1970s; (2) patterns of sexual behavior found in Australia studies between 1980 and 1988; (3) cohabitation; (4) heterosexual adolescents and the risk of human immunodeficiency virus infection; (5) intravenous drug users, AIDS, and behavior change; (6) the arrival of AIDS and patterns of homosexual behavior; (7) behavioral changes in the homosexual community in response to  the threat of AIDS; (8) research methodologies; and (9) a summary of findings.

        "description":"To have an impact on students and help them think about the major social issues faced by society today, student personnel professionals must formulate and implement new and significant initiatives. The primary question is whether or not a particular institution will permit discussion of the issues and the creation of a message containing moral and value tones. Although it might be fairly easy for an institution to take a stand on alcohol or drug use, it may be more difficult to reach a position on issues of safe sex and of homosexuality. Peer helpers have been used in the areas of orientation, tutoring, alcohol and drug education, wellness and health education, and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) education. The question is whether these peers will take on the new role  of public activists who can challenge other students' behavior and thinking. Colleges could also borrow techniques from the popular mass media. The chief student affairs officer needs to be one of the leaders in the effort; student affairs staff, other campus personnel, and students need to be involved. The University of Maine at Farmington has developed a plan that engages students by emphasizing novel means of communication that will rouse student emotion and sensitivity. The experience at the university has been revealing and instructive. (NB)",

This study was conducted to describe caregivers' perceptions of the helpfulness of cash assistance and to identify factors associated with perceived helpfulness. Subjects were co-resident caregivers (N=155) whose disabled family member was a non-institutionalized veteran aged 65 or over who was a beneficiary of the Veterans' Administration Aid & Attendance program. Caregivers completed descriptive items regarding the veteran's disability and activities of daily living limitations, amount of care provided, and type of formal and informal supports, and a questionnaire consisting of five measurement scales assessing emotional strain, financial  strain, future outlook, perceived helpfulness, and program knowledge. The results indicated that most of the 155 caregivers found cash assistance to be helpful in supporting the veterans' care at home. Caregivers who reported lower financial and emotional strain were more likely to find cash assistance helpful. Those who received a higher benefit and who spent it on health-supportive items as opposed to everyday necessities were also more likely to rate the benefit as helpful. The more helpful cash assistance was perceived to be, the less restricted caregivers' future outlook, the better their subjective mental health, and the greater their confidence in their ability to continue providing care at home.

In May 1988, 10th grade students (N=2,949) enrolled in 46 high schools in California completed questionnaires on background characteristics; educational aspirations and post-high school plans; career objectives; course enrollments in mathematics and science; involvement by parents, teachers, and counselors in course enrollment decisions; and attitudes toward school, course decision making, and achievement motivation. The findings revealed that the students had high aspirations, with 50% planning to attended a four-year college in the 2 years following high school graduation. Hispanic students had lower aspirations, lower enrollments in  college preparation classes, and lower grade point averages than did Blacks, Whites, or Asians. While 65% of the students had a career goal, many lacked congruence between their career goal and their high school program. The findings suggest that students need to begin receiving information on educational and career planning in the eighth grade and need to continue receiving such information throughout high school. Students also need to be provided with opportunities to move from non-college preparatory courses to college preparatory courses through tutoring, extra coursework, or special transition courses.

Women (N=101) completed a questionnaire about their background and their physical and psychological responses to the premenstrual experience. Most of the respondents were between the ages of 31 and 40; most were married without children; most were either Catholic or Jewish; and most reported being white collar workers with almost one-half reporting some college education. Most respondents reported that they did not experience mood changes when they first began menstruating. The majority of women (78.4%) reported experiencing mood changes one week prior to menstruation. Of the  women who reported premenstrual mood changes, over 68% reported feeling sad and depressed, 31.7% reported feeling anxious, and 18.8% reported feeling angry and edgy. Forty-five percent of the women specifically stated that their mood changes affected their interpersonal relationships. These mood changes appeared to increase over time, as women got older.

Four presentations are included. \"Student Development and the Practitioner\" by Dan Abrahamowicz reviews some of the literature and research in the area of student affairs and concludes that, for the practitioner, the concept of balance reflects an equilibrium between theory and practice and between institutional ecology and structure and student needs. \"Balance--A Practitioner's Experience\" by Phil Whitner discusses his experiences  as a student development professional. Focusing on his experiences with student-athletes, his concludes that the student's ability to determine, acquire, and balance a specific to fulfill a need deficit is an important step toward that student's development. \"Balance--Departmental Perspective\" by Don Sanz presents a general basic outline for college and university counseling centers. The outline includes sections on traditional versus non-traditional service delivery systems, future institutional concerns, and counseling center response for the future. \"Balance--Divisional Perspective\" by David McIntire identifies five critical areas that are instrumental in student development: staffing, operations, philosophy, modeling, and survival. Student affairs professionals are advised to attend  to these critical areas. (NB)",

        "description":"Young, poorly educated, single mothers from lower socioeconomic groups are commonly identified as being at high risk of engaging in physical abuse. However, the seemingly obvious relationship between adolescent parenting and child maltreatment is not clearly supported by previous empirical research. This study, based on an ecological framework, reexamined the issue using a nationally representative sample of mothers (N=1,997). All analyses controlled for family income, race, number of minor children in the home, age of abused child, mother's education, and whether mother was a single parent. Physical abuse was measured with the Conflict Tactics Scale. Using mothers' age at time of birth of the abused child, the younger the mother, the greater the rate of child abuse. However,  there was not a significant relationship when mother's age was measured as age at time of abuse. Large families and minority children were also found to be at greater risk of abuse. The findings have implications for prevention of physical abuse at both the microsystem and macrosystem level. At the micro level, the findings confirm the importance of making contraceptives and abortion widely available so that motherhood can be postponed and family size can be controlled. At the macro level, the findings suggest that steps to reduce the poverty that is so often associated with minority group status can lower the rate of child abuse. (Author/ABL)",

Addressing such &quot;pipeline&quot; issues is critical for increasing the supply of minority professionals in public school teaching and administration, school counseling, and school psychology. Focus group discussions were undertaken to broaden the understanding of these issues and to guide the development of appropriate resource materials; participants in these discussions were 139 seventh and eighth graders and 109 of their parents. All participants were black. Students were identified as academically or economically &quot;at risk&quot; or were interested in going to college or possessed the potential to do college work. Ten recommendations for project development  were made: (1) assemble and work with a local task force from key minority organizations; (2) communicate with parents and families about availability of assistance to students; (3) organize parent support groups; (4) provide parenting skills assistance; (5) conduct workshops for parents about testing, tracking, graduation requirements, etc.; (6) provide parents with information about education careers; (7) collect and distribute information regarding policies, requirements, and common practices affecting academic success and opportunities for college enrollment; (8) provide opportunities for cultural enrichment to enhance development of minority students; (9) sponsor structured career-planning programs for minority students; and (10) bring minority educators together to discuss their  role in recruiting future minority educators.

        "description":"Previous research has reported that a pervasive individualism undermines social commitment in American life. This research also found evidence of a counseling attitude which reinforces individualism contrary to social commitment. This study examined counseling and individualism from three perspectives: the philosophical foundations of counseling, the ethical orientation of counseling, and the goals of counseling. The study consisted of two separate research projects. The first line of research, an examination of the goals of counseling as presented in major psychotherapeutic theories, indicated that self-determined self-fulfillment of the individual was perhaps the prominent value in counseling, although interpersonal and social responsibility were also clearly and strongly  affirmed in counseling. The second line of research asked how clients would react in actuality to the social commitment as compared to the individualistic orientation; for this study, a roleplay of a marriage problem with children was created with separate outlines for individualist and social commitment counseling approached to the problem. Four student counselors were trained in the two approaches and both approaches were offered to 26 actor-clients. Counselors' behaviors and characteristics were evaluated by the actor-clients. As between the social commitment treatment and the individualistic treatment, the results indicated that subject-clients' perceptions of counselors' characteristics and behaviors were not significantly different. A reasonable inference from these empirical  findings is that clients do not perceive counselors using a social commitment emphasis as having behaviors and characteristics contrary to their individual welfare.

        "description":"As a result of Freud's seminal postulations of the psychoanalytic bases for one's God-concept, it is a frequently accepted hypothesis that an individual's image of God is largely a reflection of experiences with and feelings toward one's own father. While such speculations as to an individual's phenomenological conceptions of God have an intriguing psychoanalytic appeal, supporting empirical evidence has been mixed. This study investigated the relationship of 213 college students' connotations of the &quot;wrathfulness-kindliness&quot; of God to their mother's and father's nurturance; their mother's and father's permissiveness, authoritarianism, and authoritativeness; and their own self-esteem. While parental nurturance, authoritarianism, and authoritativeness were related to participants'  conceptions of God (thus providing support for psychoanalytic assertions), the variable of self-esteem far outweighed all other variables in accounting for the variance in God-concepts. These results suggest that previous empirical support for psychoanalytic speculations as to the parental origins of individuals' God-concepts may largely derive from the influence of a strong correlate of parental nurturance and authority, i.e., self-esteem.

If pre-retirees are to carry out their housing and location choices, the adequacy of potential retirement income is important. If income is inadequate, housing expenses may become a burden and housing equity may be needed as income to meet current expenses. This study examined the financial retirement planning of subjects (N=5,662) who preferred to retire in rural and urban areas. Subjects preferred to live in counties with middle-sized cities, least preferring counties  with very large or very small cities. Those who preferred counties with larger populations expected to have more financial income sources, on average, than those who preferred to retire in counties with smaller populations. The respondents preferring mobile homes anticipated the fewest income sources; those who preferred recreational vehicles anticipated the next fewest. (ABL)",

This study proposed that expected consequences of resisting peer pressure to drink alcohol may be important influences on actual drinking behavior and focused on describing these expectations. Sixth-graders (N=70) were presented with a hypothetical dilemma involving peer pressure to drink beer and asked to provide a strategy for dealing with the friend and expectations for the friend's response and the situation outcome. Strategy success was defined as being resistant to pressure to drink, while minimizing distancing from peers. The majority of subjects were able to generate some form of a response to peer pressure to drink that was an expression of a refusal. However, the simple &quot;Just Say  No&quot; response was judged by raters as less likely to be successful in handling the drinking dilemma based on the criteria of resisting the pressure to drink while minimizing any distancing or alienation from friends. &quot;No&quot; responses that were accompanied by additional explanations or communications which helped to ease the air of conflict with the peer or which sought to persuade the peer of the reasons behind the decision were associated with more positive expectations regarding both the friend's response and the outcome of the situation. Girls had more positive expectations than did boys for situation outcomes. (Author/ABL)",

        "description":"Being black and disabled are characteristics which are frequently rejected by the larger society. When counselors and black disabled clients come together, they usually bring different life experiences because of physical abilities and race. There may be more similarities if both the client and counselor are disabled or both are of the same race. When counselors encounter clients who are different, they are confronted with obstacles which may be referred to as dispositional and situational variables. Dispositional barriers refer to personal feelings, attitudes, and self-perceptions which counselors and clients have. Situational barriers are relevant to personal circumstances. The last barrier concerns human relations skills; according to previous reearch deceptive and defensive  techniques are used by blacks, indicating that blacks have strong fears of failure and fear of expressing genuine emotions. These techniques prevent others from removing social barriers. When working with these clients, counselors should demonstrate: (1) unconditional positive regard; (2) enabling characteristics; (3) knowledge of jargon used by blacks, discriminatory practices, and community resources; (4) interest in clients' progress; (5) acceptance of the client; (6) congruence between verbal and non-verbal communication; (7) openness; and (8) altruism. Finally, counselors should be humble in their omnipotence. (ABL)",

        "description":"This report presents an overview of previous research on teenage mothers and education. The report provides practical advice on how educators can work with youth-service workers and community activists to reduce the institutional barriers that keep pregnant and parenting teenagers from remaining in or returning to a diploma-granting educational program or graduate equivalent degree. Chapters 1 and 2 offer a review of what is known about the current situation of pregnant and parenting students and how schools and school districts are responding to them. The third and final chapter offers guidelines on how to initiate a districtwide or school-based strategy for helping young mothers complete high school. It is pointed out that a limitation of this report is that it does not  directly consider teenage fathers since young mothers are usually the custodial parents; nevertheless, many of the changes discussed in this report also speak to the educational needs of young fathers. The report concludes that helping teenage mothers when they are young, will, in many cases, help to set them on the path to self-sufficiency, lessening their need for extensive assistance when they are older and thus improving the prospects of their children as well. The appendix includes a list of resource organizations; questions for use in gathering information about students and school services; a list of documents from a New York city working group on educational opportunities for pregnant and parenting adolescents; and a policy statement on school-age parents from the Boston School  Committee.

This study attempted to identify differences and similarities among the value hierarchies of adolescents who have never tried tobacco, adolescent tobacco experimenters, and adolescents who use tobacco daily. A questionnaire assessing tobacco usage, selected demographic information, and terminal values with the Rokeach Value Survey, was administered to 5,128 adolescents from grades 7 through 12. The priority placed on the terminal values of health, family security, a comfortable life, a world at peace, a sense of accomplishment, an exciting life, mature love, pleasure, social recognition, national  security and salvation were statistically significant in differentiating the three groups of adolescents. Experimenters placed significantly higher priorities on the terminal values of health and a world at peace as compared to the daily users. Daily users placed significantly higher levels of emphasis on the values of a sense of accomplishment, mature love, and salvation than the tobacco experimenters did. Non-users placed significantly higher priorities on family security, a world at peace, a sense of accomplishment, and salvation as compared to experimental users. Terminal value hierarchies of abstainers stressed health, family security, a world at peace, salvation, and national security more than indicated by daily users. (Author/ABL)",

In order to fully explore the consequences of being a child of an alcoholic, it is first necessary to examine the alcoholic family system. This study investigated whether a sample of college students who were adult children of alcoholics (ACOAs) did exhibit greater levels of these negative personality characteristics than did their non-ACOA peers. The relationship between parental alcohol use and the respondents' alcohol use was also of interest. Subjects (N=103) were college students in an introductory psychology course who completed a  questionnaire in which they reported how well they could see themselves in the negative personality characteristics, their parents' drinking behavior, and their own drinking behavior. Scores on the ACOA characteristics were not correlated with the overall measure of parental alcoholism, ACOA self-identification, nor the respondents' alcohol use. These findings raise important questions about the accuracy of the common portrayal of ACOAs in the literature. Perhaps the characteristics associated with ACOAs in the literature are relatively common in all people, regardless of their parents' drinking behavior. The survey instrument is appended.

There will never be enough mental health professionals to allow one-to-one counseling to be a major source of information to people seeking assistance.

The difficulties with media counseling include the fact that very few mental health professionals have  any knowledge of media complexities and difficulties. Media counseling has the potential for research. Media counselors should see their roles as educators.

This study used data from a larger study on guidance and counseling needs assessment of primary school pupils of Gachika Sub-location, Nyeri Town, and Nairobi City. Differences in ethnic groups, location of subjects (rural, semi-urban, and urban), age of subjects, and discrepancy between pupils' perception of their own problems and perceptions of their teachers were some of the factors that contributed to the necessity of carrying out a needs assessment before developing guidance and counseling programs in schools. Specifically this study sought to delineate academic, occupational, and psychological needs of pupils  (N=720) in grades seven and five. The pupils rated their perception of their problems regarding how often each stated problem affected them. In addition, 69 teachers who taught the pupils were used in that study to countercheck the pupils' responses. The results indicated that pupils were under great pressure to perform well in the Certificate of Primary Education and to be admitted into government secondary schools from parents and relatives. The pupils expressed a high anxiety and fear related to this pressure. A guidance and counseling program could be effective in changing such devastating and unrealistic attitudes on the part of parents and pupils themselves. (ABL)",

In response to this situation a model middle school dropout prevention program was implemented for a small city public school system. This study assessed the effectiveness of the first year of the program. A variety of outcome measures are used to determine the program's impact. The results of the evaluation were then used as the base for program modifications in the second project year. The program encouraged students toward academic success. Students were paid wages in script for attending class, completing assignments, and behaving themselves. For the at-risk middle school sixth grade students (N=22) participating in the  program, attendance, perceived competence, achievement test scores, and course grades were compared to test for significant differences at the end of the school year. The results indicated that students in the program did not demonstrate change on achievement criteria. No significant differences in self-perception between at-risk and not at-risk students were found. The consensus was that the positive aspects of the 9-month program were not sufficient to counterbalance the years of learned failure experienced by students in the program. It was concluded that if dropout prevention programs are to succeed they must increase their intensity of treatment. (ABL)",

This study was designed to assess the outcomes of a personal empowerment program. The sample consisted of 25 male and 27 female ninth grade students. Students took a pretest and received a total activities score which represented the degree to which they were involved in organized activities at school and in their communities. Subjects were selected from the middle range of activity participation and then randomly assigned to the experimental or control group. Nineteen students completed a 1-week summer workshop on personal empowerment with follow-up sessions during the school year. The summer workshop consisted of small  and large group activities focused on leadership, communications, assertiveness, stress management, and decision-making. Students took a posttest 6 months following the week-long workshop. Results indicated that the effect of the personal empowerment program was to maintain the experimental group's level of activity participation while the control group decreased its level of participation. No significant differences were found at posttest for locus of control or self-esteem. The value of the findings in general is that participation in activities, at least by adolescents with moderate activity involvement, can be affected, even through a fairly simple and short intervention.

Undergraduate (N=124) and graduate (N=212) students at Purdue University responded to a questionnaire by listing up to 10 personal projects and rating the 2 most important ones with respect to perceived ability, motivational orientations, project characteristics, and project satisfaction. Results revealed that academic projects were the most popular personal projects. Satisfaction with projects was found to be positively related to the perceived ability about the project. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses of questionnaire data indicated that motivational orientation had moderating effects on the relationship  between project satisfaction and perceived ability about the project. Findings showed that the involvement of self-concept in affect regulation was most salient for ego-oriented (as opposed to task-oriented) subjects, although the relative importance of the project was crucial in eliciting the active involvement of self-concept in affect regulation. The study also identified a new and useful motivational orientation--social solidarity--to expand on the conceptions of motivation characterized by ego orientation and task orientation.

Invitational education is predicated on the idea that every student is able, valuable, and responsible, and that students' self-worth depends upon their consistently being treated with dignity and respect. Accordingly, the main goal of the London Project was to assist the members of each school community in constructing an Inviting Education program. Four secondary schools were identified to be involved in implementing the program, and members of the  Invitational Education team met with teachers, staff, and students from the four schools to help teachers identify ways to invite all of their students into the education practice. Each school established a liaison committee to work with the members of the team. This paper presents an extended description of the project and detailed findings and recommendations, including recommendations for policies, people, places, and the program.

        "description":"The presence of family caregivers in their homes has mitigated the need for the elderly to choose between reducing health services (and thus health) to levels that they can afford or going into serious debt to maintain health. However, caregivers must balance their role of health producer in the home with their role of income producer in the labor market. This study used data from the National Long Term Care and National Survey of Informal Caregivers (1982) to link and examine two decisions of employed informal caregivers (the allocation of time to care production and to the labor market) among German-, Irish-, English- and African-Americans. The results revealed that among ethnic caregivers, production factors, access to financial resources, and personal characteristics of  caregivers were significant determinants of decisions concerning caregiving and labor hours. It was found that the lower the health status of the elderly care receiver and/or the worse the health of the caregiver, the more likely the caregiver was to increase caregiving hours and reduce labor market hours. White ethnic groups were found to exhibit heterogeneous patterns of caregiving. (Author/TE)",

These factors were combined into an overall profile, characterizing PBTS students as single, non-parent, white, and dormitory residents, with parents or spouse approving of the decision to attend PBTS. Most were also male, between the ages of 18 and 19, out of high school or a previous college program for less than 1 year, residents of New York state, and planning to work while in school.

This study, based on a national study of male caregivers, examined the availability and level of family help received by male caregivers; the closeness, allegiance, and supportiveness in their families; and the relationship between these variables and such issues as caregiver burden and the degree of affectionate reciprocity between the caregivers and the recipients of their care. The results revealed that the average male caregiver was a white, protestant, middle class, moderately well-educated, retired man who was 68 years old. Most caregivers were husbands taking care of their wives. A minority were sons caring for a parent; instances  of men helping in-laws, siblings, or friends were rare. Caregivers spent many hours each day performing a broad range of caregiving tasks and had been doing so for long period of time. Although most had living children or siblings, levels of concrete assistance from relatives were uneven. Study findings have implications for gender-sensitive service delivery and suggest directions for future research on male caregivers. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"What are creative people like? There is evidence that four personality traits appear to differentiate more creative from less creative people: devotion to work, independence, drive for originality, and flexibility. Creative people do not have higher intelligence quotients (IQs) or get better school grades than others--in fact, no cognitive abilities have been identified which reliably distinguish between creative and non-creative people. All of the variables which discriminate between creative and non-creative people are motivational. What cognitive factors are involved in creative acts? Years of preparation are essential for creative activity in many fields. Goal setting is the critical element in many creative acts. Other factors are: choosing good problem representations,  defining good problems in ill-defined problem situations, accurately evaluating the shortcomings of your own work, and taking effective action to revise these shortcomings. The failure of cognitive ability measures such as IQ to predict creative performance indicates that creative performance has its origin not in innate cognitive abilities but rather in the motivation of the creative person. That is, differences in creativity have their origin in differences in motivation. Over a period of time, these differences in motivation cause cognitive differences (such as the acquisition of extensive knowledge) which contribute in critical ways to creative performance. These motivational and cognitive differences jointly account for the observed differences between creative and non-creative  individuals, but the origin is in motivation, not in cognition.

Data were collected from 45 university undergraduates, who were asked to respond to 24 sentence triads. Within each triad, two sentences contained phonemic confusions (visual tongue-twisters) and one was a control sentence that contained a natural mix of word-initial phonemes and formed an approximate semantic paraphrase of one of the tongue-twisters. Two-word memory probes were created for 16 of the sentence triads. Reading times for the sentences, response times to the  probes, and response accuracy were recorded. Results revealed that adult readers took significantly longer to read tongue-twisters than to read control sentences. Adult readers also took significantly longer to respond to memory probes from tongue-twisters than from those of control sentences. There were no significant differences in response accuracy to the three probe types (control sentence, alveolar tongue-twister, and fricative tongue-twister). The findings suggest that sound-based information is still used by skilled adult readers during sentence comprehension. Examples of the three types of stimuli and data results are included. (KEH)",

Subjects, 88 eighth-grade students enrolled in the Florida State University Developmental Research School, took several tests and inventories designed to gather data in the areas of capacity, achievement, and reading interests. Subjects read segments from social studies texts written at or below grade level and answered questions designed to test literal comprehension, inferential composition, and vocabulary understanding. Results indicated that (1) a sample of history textbooks was shown to give inaccurate, insipid treatments of important historical periods; (2) readability formulas are not good indicators of the comprehensibility of  social studies selections as measured by literal and inferential comprehension questions; (3) the subjects scored very poorly on vocabulary test items; (4) technical selections containing geography and science concepts and relationships were especially difficult to understand; (5) a statistically significant number of the best readers compared to the poorest readers like to read mystery and adventure books; (6) teaching strategies designed to improve students' attitudes toward social studies should be tried; (7) authors of textbooks should use writing strategies designed to increase the comprehensibility of texts; and (8) teachers of social studies should use directed reading-thinking activities to stimulate greater involvement of students in discussions leading to attainment of concepts.

        "description":"A study examined the effect of gender, age, and cognitive task on three types of reading recall. Subjects, 40 boys and girls in the second grade and 40 in the fifth grade from a suburban Northeast school system, all reading at or above grade level, performed cued or free recall on four high-interest short stories. Reading recall was assessed via the number of explicit idea units (explicit text details), implicit idea units (inferences), and figurative idea units (metaphors and/or analogies) recalled. Results showed significant main effects for age and task, as expected, with clear differences favoring fifth graders over second graders and favoring subjects in the cued condition over the free. No main effect was found due to gender differences; however, sharp differences between  boys and girls were found depending upon the information retrieval task they were assigned. Boys' and girls' reading recall performances differed dramatically, with boys demonstrating superior recall in the cued condition and girls in the free condition. Findings suggest that boys need more structure in their recall tasks, while girls are better at imposing their own structure. The study illustrates the importance of continued attention to gender as it interacts with reading recall in complex ways. A follow-up study combining quantitative and qualitative research methods will address the issue of why the present results might have occurred.

The first study (79 subjects) compared the forgetting of French vocabulary words learned either by using the keyword technique or by rote rehearsal. In the second study (76 subjects) the &quot;method of loci&quot; was compared to rote rehearsal for serial recall of unrelated word lists. Results indicated that subjects using mnemonic devices forgot at a faster rate than subjects rote rehearsing the same information. Thus, contrary to widely held expectations, mnemonic devices do not appear to confer any long-term advantage to the retention of material so  learned. Perhaps the deleterious effect of mnemonic devices upon memory is due to the interference that may accompany use of an unfamiliar learning strategy. This suggests that training in the use of mnemonic devices should be of an extended and distributed nature so that potential interference effects can be minimized. (Two figures are included.) (SR)",

Initially, children develop fluency through familiar narrative structures and themes. As the children achieve reading fluency, however, they benefit from increased exposure to expository text. Supporting this thrust are varied approaches and resources, including installing a classroom library, reading aloud, and using magazines. Maintaining a balance of narration and exposition also means not overdoing one type of text to the deemphasis or preclusion of the other, regardless of the teaching-learning context. The challenge to educators, especially those supporting a whole language philosophy, is to encourage a balance of discourse types as children engage in authentic literacy events  throughout the school year.

Children can easily memorize the rhymes and act them out for the class. The rhymes can then be written down and used as reading material for the students. A simple cut-and-paste activity can help children learn phonics. Each phoneme is named and defined as it is introduced. The children then look through magazines to find examples of the phoneme they just learned and explain what they see in the picture and how they hear  the sound in the topic, and they can attach a name to their picture. The contributions are then collected and the entire class reviews the pictures and the corresponding phonemes. The materials used in these activities are at hand and are inexpensive. (RS)",

Further, the success of literacy programs of the future is contingent upon the resolution of three major problem areas: (1) the concept of literacy; (2) the programs of literacy; and (3) the politics of literacy. A concept of literacy is needed for the stabilization of what precisely constitutes literacy. A concept provides a more enduring description, definitions do not. The central issue is: When is an individual permanently literate, now and forever? The adult literacy efforts of the past have been piece-meal, haphazard, and spasmodic at best. This is not to belittle the remarkable attempts, but only to admit the obvious. The fact that the level of basic literacy  is attainable for nearly 100% of any population in any culture in any sovereign country does not speak well for the governing groups which are responsible for education. Governmental commitment, professional involvement, and \"turfism\" will have to change to enhance the future of adult literacy programs. (One figure is included; 18 references are attached.) (RS)",

At-risk readers do not perceive reading as a search for meaning acquisition. Teachers must provide a learning environment that focuses on reading, thinking, and discussion rather than skills, workbooks, and mastery tests. Many at-risk readers are not aware of their own reading weakness. By providing students with reading materials that are slightly above their reading ability which focus on subjects of high interest to the students,  at-risk readers will be reminded that they still have a way to go in becoming readers who can use reading as a means of unlocking information. At-risk readers enjoy being read to. Teachers should provide students with their own copies of the book being read; at-risk readers can gain immensely by following along while a good reader reads. At-risk readers are more motivated when they feel they have some control over the reading environment. Having students make predictions about a story before they read it provides a format in which students are reading to prove or disprove their predictions about the story, creating their own purpose for reading.

Results seemed to indicate that teachers are not only concerned that students learn from content material but that teachers also recognize the importance of developing students' higher level thinking skills. Results also indicated that while the majority of teachers used study guides as a way of guiding  their students' reading, the less experienced teachers were just as convinced that their purpose was to help students study for tests.

        "description":"Based on the premise that schools apparently fail to match reading instruction to children's needs, this study was conducted to learn about the process of changing teacher behavior in such a way that a match exists between what is taught and who is being taught. Year-long observation of one kindergarten program that was supplemented with attempts to effect instruction that reflected the children's abilities was conducted. Standard curriculum was to provide instruction for colors, shapes, letters, numbers, words, and letter-sound correspondences. The teacher's tendency to spend more time with the least able children became apparent early in the year and never changed. An equally persistent practice of the teacher was to cover too much with the poorer students and too little with  the others. Another tendency was to assign equal importance to everything. The usefulness of knowing a particular letter-sound correspondence had no effect on the amount of instructional time it received. The 28 observation periods which occurred during the year supported the conclusion that the teacher continued to assign unique importance to phonics even though a multifaceted conception of beginning reading instruction was persistently recommended and discussed. Interviews revealed that it seems likely that what was considered to be a means for achieving matched instruction was seen by the teacher as a reason to worry even more. Abandoning the long traditions of a lockstep curriculum is a very slow process, requiring much more than one year. (MG)",

Videodisc and text materials (the films &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes&quot; and &quot;Oliver&quot; and stories by Charles Dickens and Conan Doyle) were used to create a &quot;macrocontext&quot; for learning. The curriculum evaluation project spanned a three-year period; findings reported here were collected during the second and third years. During the second year, two classes of students participated. Students were assigned to either an experimental or comparison group with classes taught by the project staff. During the third year, three classes of fifth-grade students participated in the study and were taught by regular classroom teachers. Results from the second year indicated that integrated  instruction using macrocontexts had the greatest benefit on lower achieving students. The results of the average students indicated that there may be greater forgetting for students taught using a traditional approach than for students using a macrocontextual approach. Results from the third year indicated that the effects are replicable across teachers and from experimental to field settings. Students in each of the three classes showed significant increases in their knowledge of the time period. Results indicated that macrocontext instruction is relatively more effective than traditional instruction in helping at-risk students learn social studies content, and macrocontext instruction is generally more effective in promoting long-term retention of this information. Results of the  inference data provided preliminary evidence that knowledge from one domain is accessible for solving problems in another domain. (Three tables of data are included.) (MG)",

Inviting students to study topics that affect both their own lives and the greater community around them encourages self-interest. It is also important to provide essential  background information. After initial discussion, students should be asked to read a selection and then respond in writing to several questions. The following categories can be used to generate a variety of interesting and searching questions: (1) recognition; (2) translation; (3) inference; (4) evaluation; (5) explanation; and (6) use of imagination.

Case-based learning (an instructional method long used with graduate business, law, and medical students) is one method that can be used to foster critical thinking and schema construction. For this study, a case was defined as a narrative that presented a theme portrayed in a novel but presented it in a problem-solving format that related text ideas to real-world situations. The effects of case based instruction were compared to those of traditional instruction on students' ability to assemble and incorporate different knowledge sources in memory. Ninety-two ninth graders in a rural  community participated in the 6-week study. The students read the novel &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; and were evaluated by their written responses to essays and timed writings. Findings indicated that activating and expanding knowledge through the use of thematically organized and cross-disciplinary cases facilitated students' ability to generate explanations for new information that were plausible and meaningful.

Students read a variety of literary and informative passages and then answered a series of multiple-choice and open-ended questions designed to measure their ability to read and comprehend these passages. In addition, students provided background information about their reading experiences both in and out of school. To supplement this information, the teachers of fourth graders participating in the assessment completed a questionnaire about the instruction their students received. Findings indicated that: (1)  the average reading proficiency of students increased substantially from grades 4 to 8 and less dramatically from grades 8 to 12; (2) at all three grade levels, there were great differences in reading proficiency according to socioeconomic status; (3) more proficient readers reported home and school environments that emphasized academic achievement; (4) students reported doing very little reading in school and for homework; (5) students' interest in books seems to decrease as they progress through school; (6) emphasis on beginning reading instruction in grades 1, 2, and 3 is overwhelmingly phonics-based; (7) instruction for most fourth graders is based on a single basal reader; and (8) reasoning activities are not emphasized in class.

        "author":["Greene, Stuart"],
        "description":"This paper argues for a dialectical conception of theory that avoids the problem of trying to yoke together theories that embody conflicting epistemological and idealogical concerns in any unified way. Called a &quot;cognitive-social epistemic,&quot; this dialectic is a theoretical construct that subsumes a family of cognitive and social theories that accounts for how writing gets produced. This construct acknowledges the power of social and ideological forces that can circumscribe thought and action; at the same time, it recognizes the critical role that individuals play in the construction of meaning through manipulating a community's symbols. Embedded in these two broad conceptions of a dialectical theory of composing are three principles that emphasize systematic inquiry and  reflexivity in both theory and research. First, the development of theory depends on critical reflection, particularly upon the conceptual frameworks and methods that motivate work in composition. Second, the development of such a construct depends in large part on fine-grained observations of the processes that are of interest, observations that are meaningful to both teachers and researchers. And third, the adequacy of explanations can be measured by the extent to which the theories reflect the social contexts studied, not by how well they fulfill the ideological concerns that a given theorist might privilege. A review of social theories of knowledge in composition and the kind of teaching that has grown out of these theories focuses on (1) a weakness in the antifoundationalist program  (which deconstructs categories of truth but gives no clear foundation or criterion for action); and (2) a need to realign discussions of literacy and literate practice to find a way to talk about how individuals create knowledge that leads to action.

        "author":["Bannister, Linda"],
        "description":"Of the many women who have contributed to the making of knowledge in composition, three theorists in particular are excellent representatives of a feminine rhetoric that is changing the rhetorical tradition from hierarchy and authoritative achievement to a relational, collaborative, and integrated process. Mina Shaughnessy is the quintessential practitioner/inquirer--dedicated, intolerant of inequalities in education, and determined to strengthen the marginalized, to let them learn. Her goal is to empower the writer by knowledge through relational and collaborative measures. Her practice led to the theory that teachers and students learn most as equal participants in a dialogic process. Next, Linda Flower is a formalist, basing her research on the construction of a model and on  the testing of that model against the system it represents. Flower's rhetoric, with its emphasis on transformation, growth and learning, and its problem-solving approach, contrasts with an androcentric rhetoric's aim to &quot;win&quot; and establish authority. Not insignificant is her considerable involvement in collaboratively conducted and authored research. Finally, Janet Emig has revolutionized composition theory and practice with her focus on writing as a mode of learning. She characterized composition as at a pre-paradigmatic stage and demonstrated that intellectual history is a tacit tradition, founded on multi-disciplinary approaches. Her philosophy of writing is unabashedly human-centered, her rhetoric founded on collaboration and community. Because of these women's contributions, rhetoric  now includes relationship, growth, community, and learning as well as achievement, authoritative weight, and victory.

        "description":"A study explored how writers with extensive experience and learning in an academic discipline used both topical and rhetorical knowledge to construct synthesis essays. Subjects, 20 psychology graduate students and 20 business graduate students, wrote synthesis essays on either the topics of &quot;supply-side economics&quot; or &quot;rehearsal in memory.&quot; Half of the subjects completed think-aloud protocols, and their composing processes were analyzed for different qualities and frequencies of elaborations and rhetorical awareness and for task representation. Analysis of variance indicated that (1) &quot;high knowledge&quot; writers evidenced unique elaborative and rhetorically sensitive performance; (2) high knowledge writers included more &quot;new&quot; information in their essays in the top levels of essay  organization; (3) low knowledge writers elaborated less but did rely on structural and content-based awareness to compose. Findings confirmed the interrelatedness of comprehension and composing processes and illustrated how writers, with varying levels of topic familiarity, use both their knowledge of disciplinary topics and their experience as readers and writers to compose synthesis essays.

        "description":"Current research has fragmented educators' vision of both written language and development. A more integrative vision, one that preserves the integrity of written language as a symbol system, is based on five principles that characterize written language development: (1) the establishment of equivalences; (2) exploration and orchestration of the system; (3) reliance on shifting relationships of form and function; (4) differentiation and integration of symbolic functions; and (5) participation in social dialogue. These principles highlight the dialectical relationship between function and form, between child construction and adult guidance. The articulated vision of development differs in fundamental ways from most current viewpoints, as it does not consider written language as  simply an extension of the child's oral language but as the evolution of a distinct symbolic option with links to the child's entire symbolic repertoire. Viewing written language growth in this way may allow for a more open-ended vision of its development, and the developmental principles discussed may suggest some possibilities for negotiation between whole language and basic skill proponents.

In one course, students were instructed to read a literary work for a class. When the class met, the students were to write the name of the assigned story, the author, and anything they wanted to write about the story. Students wrote freely for 10 minutes, then were to write a summation sentence and participate in a discussion of what they had written. Following the next reading assignment, students were to write about the material at home, then in class, and a third time following a class discussion. By the third writing the students began to develop a fairly sophisticated understanding of what they had read. For subsequent reading assignments, students  went through the three stages on their own. The technique aided understanding of the readings; some students reported that they were even applying the methods in other classes.

Students, most of whom were women in their thirties, responded to the readings by forging personal connections with the texts' authors. Student-centered learning strategies were found to be especially productive with regard to students who were members of under-represented, marginalized groups. After first reading some noted autobiographies, participants were arranged into groups which read autobiographical  works in progress and discussed audience responses. Authors and audiences alike were encouraged to negotiate criteria which gave predominance to writers' individual goals. Confidence and writing skill grew.

Walter Ong focuses on fiction and believes that what has been said about fictional narrative applies to all writing. Lev Vygotsky offers the view that students work in the zone of proximal development and observes that thought itself develops as a result of our social experiences. John Trimbur has presented a convincing argument that by melding the work of Vygotsky with the work of Mikhail Bakhtin, educators can understand that writers can have the voices of many others in their heads and can draw on these voices freely when they compose. All of this suggests the concept of collaborative learning, in the vein of Kenneth Bruffee's work, suggesting that an educator's task involves engaging  students in conversation among themselves at as many points in both the writing and reading process as possible. James Reither and Douglas Vipond explain that by developing claims cooperatively, collectively, and collaboratively the members of such a community-within-a-community learn from one another, teach, support, and sustain one another. Thomas Kuhn has done much to describe the ways in which specific discourse communities socially construct knowledge. Stanley Fish calls these phenomena interpretative communities.&quot; Educators need to give students opportunities to work within the many discourse communities represented in any classroom. In this way writing and reading become mutually reinforcing, and writers and readers become mutually supportive. (Forty-two references are attached.)  (MG)",

This diverse writers' community engages throughout the 15-week fall semester in a workshop approach to writing development, following the procedure outlined by A. R. Gere and R. D. Abbott. In this procedure, groups of three or four writers share work in progress according to the following guidelines: the first writer reads aloud his or her selection twice, neither commenting nor apologizing for the writing. Other group members write responses to the text following the initial reading and during the second. The first response is a general impression summarizing the  text's meaning. The second focuses on the language of the text, especially noting what listeners like and dislike. Oral discussion follows as these notes are shared. Such a procedure allows the writer to see and hear the text in a writing community and to receive useful suggestions for possible revisions. Audiotapes of these writing groups enable teachers to hear how such arrangements work. The quantity of talk in such student-centered activity offers second language students a &quot;rich bath&quot; of language and encourages native and nonnative speakers alike to use and develop their communicative performance.

The other half of the classes worked through an inquiry unit devised by the researcher which breaks exam writing into several specific skills: identifying logistical difficulties involved in the writing situation, reading critically and preparing effectively for the exam, analyzing exam questions, and organizing a coherent essay answer. The unit contained activities which allow students to practice each skill in small groups. Students' pretest and posttest scores were compared and the  difference used as a measure of improvement level. Results indicated a significant positive effect for both groups. The inquiry group improved significantly more than the textbook group overall with average gains nearly twice as large as the textbook group.

Discussions of the bases and possible consequences of choices may--and should--lead students to ask for more freedom and more options. Students understand that teachers must evaluate them, so if teachers offer as much leeway as they can, students will try to be as fair as their teachers are. The teaching of controversies recognizes existing conflicts and avoids pretending a unity that does not exist. In writing-about-literature courses, teachers can explain why particular readings are chosen, where they fit, what the teachers' biases are, and what opposition to the teachers' methods exist. Acknowledgement of others' truths is a step toward becoming a teacher. This implies  options in ways of thinking, which is at the core of educational goals.

        "description":"A required freshman English course at Berkeley was designed on the assumption that: (1) students have already developed a set of sophisticated skills for reading popular culture texts--movies, television, and commercial literary genres--against and in terms of one another; and (2) these skills are not categorically different from those inculcated by teachers of composition or used by literary critics. Juxtaposing popular and elite texts reveals their affiliations and similarities and produces critical insights into both that students are not afraid to own. The class syllabus reflected a horizontal model of culture (rather than a &quot;high&quot; culture vs. &quot;low&quot; culture vertical model), ranging from comic books to Shakespeare, and including several trips to the movies. Such courses could  be built around a wide range of themes but would all thematize revision, require instructors to allow students to assert their authority over texts, and subordinate instructors' authority on matters of taste to their authority over questions of compositional technique. It is not the job of the academy to determine cultural standards or to hand down to an uncertainly appreciative audience a model constructed in institutional privacy. Rather, students should be taught to think critically about their own standards and everyone else's, and about the culture of which they are all a part. The practice of composition and the practice of studying culture amount to the same thing. (SR)",

Subjects were 24 sixth-grade, learning disabled students enrolled in a resource room language arts program who participated during the first year of a project. Students participated in a news reporting curriculum for 9 weeks. Group pre- and posttests focusing on writing and comprehension were also administered. Although both video and orally presented prompts produced posttest gains in the number of students who exhibited an increase in the number of categories found in their writing, substantially more students gained in the written/orally presented topic. It appears that the curriculum positively  influenced writing when removed from the video context. Students also made gains in comprehending explicit as well as implicit information in written/orally presented news stories, while comprehension of implicit and explicit information in video/broadcast news stories did not change significantly. Results also indicated that students were better able to identify correct information at the end of the 9-week curriculum as well as better able both to identify incorrect information and replace it with appropriate material. These results are consistent with previous results using video-based anchors in literacy instruction as well as in other content areas. (Two figures and four tables of data are included.

        "description":"Mikhail Bakhtin's concept of dialogism has applications to rhetoric and composition instruction. Dialogism, sometimes translated as intertextuality, is the term Bakhtin used to designate the relation of one utterance to other utterances. Dialogism is not dialogue in the usual sense of the word; it is the context which informs utterance, and without which utterance cannot exist. Thus, composing is never the business of the writer working alone, but always the result of his or her interaction with the world, and with its readers and subjects. Dialogism rejects the notion that writing can express an individual self, believing that what is expressed in discourse is culture, or values held by a particular culture. In terms of general composition instruction, dialogism forces  individuals to reexamine their definitions of the elements of the rhetorical triangle (writer, subject, and audience), as well as the relationship of these elements to each other. Two advantages offered by dialogic thinking for composition instruction are: (1) by locating expression in society rather than in self, an enhanced appreciation of authorship as a community-based activity may result; and (2) by accepting flux as the natural order of things, and of the rhetorical situation, a true appreciation for the relentless change which underpins the composing process may be achieved, and thus those pedagogical strategies which emphasize openness, rather than closure, and which posit change as the norm can be embraced.

        "description":"By examining two autobiographies by Victorian women, the role of editors in the composing and publishing of autobiographical texts can be explored, and questions can be raised about the way personal writing is assigned, edited, and evaluated in classrooms today. The autobiography of Margaret Oliphant, a prolific Victorian novelist and critic, was cut, pasted, and published after Oliphant's death by her niece, Mrs. Harry Coghill. Based on Coghill's editorial procedures, it appears that the content was edited to present a public version of Margaret Oliphant which conformed more fully to the idea of a good writer, good mother, and good woman. The autobiography of Elizabeth Davis, a working-class, single woman, as edited by Jane Williams, represents what the editor thought was  appropriate writing for--and an appropriate self-presentation of--a working woman. The editor's position in relation to a Victorian woman's text is rather like the teacher's position in relation to personal writing done in the classroom. To what extent do teachers' comments on students' autobiographical writing reflect unstated cultural assumptions about gender? To what extent do textbooks identify &quot;good&quot; autobiographical writing with the features of one gender or another? To what extent should teachers/editors attempt to be gender-neutral? (SR)",

In addition, students were asked about the amount and types of writing they did in and out of school, the nature of the instruction they received, and their writing strategies. To supplement this information, the English or language arts teachers of eighth graders participating in the assessment completed a questionnaire on these students and the instruction they had been provided. In the informative writing task, most fourth graders (81%) wrote at least minimally acceptable  story summaries, while 74% to 84% of the eighth graders and 79% to 83% of the twelfth graders wrote minimal or better responses to two analysis tasks. In the persuasive writing task, most students (65-88%) at all three grades provided at least minimal responses. Similar to the informative writing results, elaborated responses to the persuasive tasks were rare. Students tended to perform better in the imaginative narrative tasks than on the persuasive tasks. Eighty-one percent of the fourth graders wrote minimal or better responses, while 80% to 87% of the eighth and twelfth graders generated minimal or better responses to the personal narrative task. Assessment highlights also include information on: (1) writing instruction; and (2) effects of response time on performance.

        "description":"This study investigated William Schutz's three-dimensional theory of interpersonal behavior and compatibility (FIRO) to determine its validity as a group measure of compatibility. Data were collected from 248 students enrolled in a multi-section course in small group communications at a large midwestern university. Subjects self-selected themselves into 47 groups of no less than five and no more than seven and participated in five hours of introductory interaction. After this, they were asked to develop and present two exercises on group communication topics. Several instruments, including the FIRO-B instrument, were administered to the subjects. Results revealed that the methodology of computing group compatibility from equations that measure internal dyadic compatibilities was  inefficient and inappropriate. After a reanalysis, findings suggest that even though a specific dyad in a group is compatible, the behavior and interaction of other group members may be an intervening factor causing a compatible dyad to be ineffective in the group context. The complexity of group interaction as well as the competition for attention among the group's many members may keep specific dyadic compatibilities from surfacing. Findings also suggest that defining group compatibility by measuring dyadic compatibility runs contrary to the notion of group synergy--that a group may be more than an additive function of its parts. Continued investigations into methodological issues to determine if compatibility is a useful discriminator in distinguishing effective from ineffective groups  appear to be called for.

The paper is in four sections. Following an introduction, the first section examines the prevailing educational philosophy currently guiding public speaking courses, identifies the shortcomings of this approach for meeting the needs of the African American student, and offers a more responsive and appropriate philosophic alternative. The second section suggests how a culturally sensitive public speaking course (adaptable to all students of  difference) might be developed. The paper then describes an approach to public speaking which engages students in a process of developing speeches within various cultural contexts. And finally, a brief concluding section points out that the unique qualities African American students bring to the classroom should be a great resource to a teacher, to the other students, and to the colege/university; that the differences among students should be celebrated by recognizing them and using them to enhance knowledge of subject areas; and that a true celebration of classroom differences validates not only the experience of African American students but of any student who perceives herself or himself to be somehow out of step with other members of the class.

Current conceptualizations of organizational communication suggest that the organization consists of one culture (often depicted as predominantly white and predominantly male). Yet demographics indicate a changing work force consisting of fewer white males (one projection suggests only 15% by the year 2000) and more women and minorities. With the influx of new faces come new cultures. Instructors of organizational communication must address the issue of multiculturalism as they prepare students for the transition to a rapidly evolving workplace, one in which organizational life is no longer dominated by a single  set of cultural norms. Organizational communication should be presented in a manner which is open to the possibility of many cultures rather than one culture and which considers the possibility that different organizational members function within different organizational environments. This goal may be accomplished by making explicit the assumptions made as reality is constructed through the process of organizational communication. It should be understood that this process goes on in different ways in different places throughout the organization. Students must be nurtured to understand that Black students, Asian students, Hispanic students, and White Anglo-Saxon Protestant students must evaluate communication &quot;skill&quot; in the context of their own and other cultural beliefs, attitudes, and  value systems--otherwise their communication will be ineffective.

In 1982, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced that no single system for broadcasting AM stereo would be picked by the government. Of the five competing AM stereo systems, the marketplace effectively eliminated three within 2 years. The NAB believed the keys to enhancing the sound quality appeal of AM radio to be improving both the technology for transmission and for reception. The NAB and the NRSC were able to convince the  FCC to begin a series of notices of inquiry, rulemaking proceedings, and policy changes for improvement of AM, such as reduction of interference and relaxation of many regulatory rules. Contrary to broadcaster sentiment, in 1989 the FCC unanimously decided on a technical standard for AM broadcasting which included an &quot;RF mask.&quot; Broadcasters complained of the high cost of the new standard. Criticism for the failure to upgrade gradually in the 60-year history of AM must be shared by both the FCC and the AM industry. As with FM in its struggle to gain parity, the process for AM's revitalization will take a number of years. (Five notes are included; 82 references are attached.) (RS)",

The paper provides an overview of 19 published evaluations (discussed in alphabetical order by name of author) which were studied in hopes of encouraging and directing future evaluation efforts. Results of the study provided a basis for several recommendations to guide future evaluation efforts. First, evaluations should be  multi-level. Second, trainers and researchers should continue using a variety of evaluation methods to strengthen research findings. Third, techniques for accurately measuring behavior changes need to be developed. Fourth, more studies to determine the training's ultimate impact on the organization ought to be developed. Fifth, the long-term effects of training must be examined. Finally, evaluations should be published and serve as models for future efforts. (One table is included, and 39 references are attached.)

The paper's first section outlines a theory of rhetoric and provides a historical overview. The second section shows how specific commonplaces are congruent with particular conceptions of education, and analyzes one part of a set of commonplaces and contrasts it with other sets of commonplaces. The paper concludes that such analyses can  be of value in deciding whether terms of argument are congruent with purposes of discourse. Forty notes are included. (SR)",

        "description":"Tom Metzger and his white supremacist movement, the White Aryan Resistance, attempt to build support with working class whites and youth to create white working class solidarity and racial separation. Metzger uses videotapes as one of the methods of bringing his racist and conspiratorial message to his audience. One such vehicle is &quot;Race and Reason,&quot; his long-running show (created specifically to be shown on public access cable channels) dedicated to the purity of the White race. Metzger claims that a conspiracy controls the media, that he is denied access to the media, and that access to the media equals control of the listeners. This &quot;repression&quot; then is used to justify the movement's small following, to solidify support, and to justify violence. In Kansas City (Missouri), an  application to place &quot;Race and Reason&quot; on the public access channel was met with considerable and protracted controversy and back-and-forth maneuvering, both in and out of the courts.

Each completed the Richmond-McCroskey Assertiveness-Responsiveness Measure (which consists of 20 personality characteristics) in Japanese or English. Results indicated a significant difference between the Japanese and Americans on the assertiveness/responsiveness construct. Significant differences appeared between males on the assertiveness dimension but not on the responsiveness dimension and for females on both dimensions.

        "description":"This study was conducted to demonstrate that a context-dependent discrimination can produce learning difficulty in a pseudo-spectrogram reading task and to look at what contribution segmentation makes to that difficulty. Experiment one involved 10 subjects recruited from the University of Pittsburgh, who were shown pseudo-spectrogram patterns and then asked to respond by making selections from a screen menu on a computer. Results indicated that a context-dependent discrimination can be difficult to learn. Experiment two was to try to determine whether the learning difficulty observed in experiment one was due to context-dependent segmentation, to some other factor such as salience or task demands, or to some interaction of these factors. Fifteen other subjects were given a stack  of 32 different patterns and asked to circle the important parts. Results indicated that lack of salience may play an important part in making this type of skill difficult to learn. Results of the two experiments point to several factors which can affect the difficulty of learning to read speech spectrograms. Learning difficulty may be affected by the interaction of segmentation with cue salience and task demands. The main conclusion was to confirm the influence of segmentation on learning difficulty in speech spectrogram reading. (Two figures are included, and 19 references are attached.) (MG)",

Second, as a way of demonstrating the specific influence of world view, the paper shows how it helps clarify the negotiation styles employed by various cultures. The paper then focuses on linking world view with how cultures make decisions, choose negotiators, and use abstract or concrete reasoning. Thirty references are attached. (Author/SR)",

        "description":"In much current literary and rhetorical theory, analysis of text assumes greater authority than the text and its creator. Through a reexamination of the ancient Greeks' notion of &quot;ethos&quot; (the residue of the writer or speaker in the text), the writer, reader, and text can be reunited, particularly in light of the theory of meanings proposed by I. A. Richards. Richards asserted that self can be discovered through a discovery of meaning. To Richards, the text, as the work of the writer or speaker, cannot be ignored by the reader or listener, who is to derive approximate meaning. Arriving at meaning is an investigation into the psychology of the reader, the text, and the writer. The writer's character, as reflected by the text, meets the character of the reader through the mediation  of the text. To Richards, language may be the only means by which human development can continue. Closer examination of the ethos of both writer and reader leads each to a greater understanding of the other and the other's misunderstandings. (Five notes are included; 23 references are attached.)

        "description":"&quot;House Made of Dawn&quot; by N. Scott Momaday is about language and the sacredness of the word and about what can be understood as a peculiarly Native American theory of rhetoric. All things are hinged to the physical landscape, nature, and the implications nature bears upon language. In Momaday's book, language does not represent external reality but is given precedence, such that there is no external reality except in terms of a primordial spirituality that embraces the individual's oneness with nature. Momaday tells readers about an idea lost to post-Socratic rhetorical theory, that of &quot;physis,&quot; as being one with &quot;nomos,&quot; where nature is an entity or activity that constitutes the &quot;creative surge&quot; of Being, and language, ever as much as nature, is an indigenous field where people  dwell and discover the source of their being. Running through a sermon made by one character is the idea that truth lies in language. Truth is verbal, and to say there is something behind or beyond language that it symbolizes is to burden and obscure the truth. The focus is on words as a source of creation. Momaday defines racial memory as the commitment of a community of believers to a perfect integration of an individual's mind and spirit with that of his people, most concretely manifest in the rituals, legends, and beliefs of the oral tradition. Through this perspective, community is established and preserved through story and song, creating by means of language the cultural landscape through which being is acknowledged and identity is achieved.

        "description":"The Speaking across the Curriculum (SAC) program at Hamline University in Minnesota is based upon principles similar to those of many Writing across the Curriculum (WAC) programs and is complementary to the WAC program at Hamline. The SAC program requires students to take two speaking intensive courses as well as a freshman seminar in which both discussion and writing are emphasized. The program focuses on process as opposed to product, emphasizes practice and analysis, and expects that oral communication activities will be central to the learning objectives of course content (not just an extra element added on to an already existing course). In the 1989-90 school year the program had 53 speaking intensive courses in 20 major programs. So far, faculty response has been positive,  and student response has been very positive. Far more than a process of composition or of articulating ideas in symbolic form, communication in the classroom is a matter of individuals engaged in a communicative interaction affected by such issues as social status, power, dominance issues, normative constraints, and other factors. The failure to recognize the demands upon speakers related to the social implications of their communication creates fundamental problems when trying to understand how speech works in the process of learning. Research in speech and communication has much to offer those who use oral communication processes in their teaching. (Seventeen references are attached.) (SR)",

        "description":"To develop a taxonomy of Cross Examination Debate Association (CEDA) critics, a study associated professed judging philosophy and responses to survey questions with ballot behavior and elaborated judging profiles. Subjects were debate critics who judged rounds at CEDA tournaments in the Northeast during the Spring 1989 season. In all, 13 critics had sufficient quantities of all three measures (questionnaire, philosophy statement, and ballots) to be included in the pilot study. First, analysis revealed that traditional paradigms are associated more strongly to key discriminators than are merged or new profile types. Second, the criteria discriminators, despite their limitations, were associated with relatively clearly defined profile types; however, these profile types are not  conceptually coherent. Third, the present analysis suggests that at least the following profile types should be considered as targets of future research in CEDA paradigm use: value-comparison and argument skills, argument skills and hypothesis testing, argument critic, stock issues, and analytic centered. Finally, the descriptive boundaries between paradigms are porous and unreliable. The low correlation distinctiveness between profile types indicated that paradigm adherence by critics is not a highly valued behavior. Elaboration of criteria discriminators should reveal whether the traditional or profile candidates do support taxonomic elements which would inform debaters of real differences existing among their judge-critics.

Goodness questions (reliability, replicability, and validity) get mixed with value questions (generalizability), with frustrating results for many students. Research decisions depend on the tradition or paradigm framing the endeavor. Early empiricists accepted the following assumptions: (1) truth is knowable; (2) values can be excised from the research process; (3) good research is empowering; (4) research uncovers the researcher's and others' truths; and (5) research uncovers what people believe to be true. A sixth postpositivist version of assumption 1 states  that truth has no absolutely authoritative foundation, but good research comes from good methodology properly applied. Good research is honest, open inquiry, where the researcher searches for alternative explanations and is self-critical. Evaluating the goodness and value of research requires a judgment call. Critical-scientist, constructivist, and postempiricist judges all have different evaluation criteria. In judging goodness criteria, qualitative researchers should look for 20 alternative paradigms. Those supporting postpositivist criteria must help colleagues construct new realities and resist being beaten into submission by quantitative researchers' skepticism. (24 references) (MLH)",

Brigham Young University and five surrounding school districts formed a partnership with the following objectives: (1) improve teacher and school administrator preparation programs; (2) use research findings in teaching and learning in the schools; (3) attract better qualified persons to the teaching profession; and (4) encourage collaborative inquiry by school and university personnel. Benevolent authoritarianism gave the formal partnership a structure; the informal cooperative networks  have provided the spirit of collaboration.

The complex nature of some of the Supreme Court education decisions in the late 1960s and early-to-mid 1970s increased the role of legal commentators in exploring and interpreting decisions. The focus on litigation also diverted attention from other educational issues such as exploring the root causes of school unrest. School law materials need to be specialized and tailored to meet the special issues that are common to particular positions. Teachers need to learn the basic  principles of school law and learn of the outcomes of controversial cases involving such issues as educational malpractice.

These policies have been extremely difficult to implement, and state officials face the prospect that many of them will need substantial modification. This report argues that the explanation lies in a basic dilemma that most state teacher policies pose: the need to accommodate two different, yet equally legitimate, values--popular control and professionalism--in their design and implementation. This report examines the inherent tensions between democratic control and professionalism, how they are manifested in teacher policies, how they influence subsequent implementation, and how the two  approaches might be more effectively balanced in future generations of teacher policy. The data analyzed represent over 600 interviews with state policymakers, interest group representatives, local district officials, principals, and classroom teachers in 19 local districts and 50 schools in the states of Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, and Pennsylvania.

Policy should provide direction by addressing the issues of who and what are to be evaluated, why evaluation is needed, when and by whom the evaluation is to be completed, and how the information is to be reported. An evaluation system, regardless of who is evaluated, should focus on growth. The instrument and data gathering method should be chosen according to the type of information desired and the specific school in question. If evaluation is to provide for growth, it must be approached positively and allow feedback from the individuals being evaluated and recommendations by the board. Sound evaluation is based on job description. School board functions to be evaluated include planning and policy, legislation,  judicial responsibilities, and appraisal and evaluation. The superintendent, as the chief executive officer of the board, should be directly involved in each of the four areas and make recommendations that the board can accept, reject, or modify. The superintendent evaluation process should be constructive, ongoing, and focused on improving performance.

        "description":"To address minority students' needs, increase school administrators' instructional leadership capacities, and involve parents in improving schools, school districts must recruit large percentages of women and minority educators to school leadership positions. This will not be a simple task, as entirely new definitions of school leadership are needed. Educators are being challenged to (1) find ways to keep at-risk students in school; (2) create stimulating learning environments; and (3) garner community support. Women are still underrepresented in school leadership, and minorities have not benefited from affirmative action and other equality-based legislation. The dominant reform proposals are flawed for not promoting equity, for failing to involve black educators in reform  discussions, and failing to propose measures ensuring minorities' access to school leadership positions. What is needed is a reconceptualization of school leadership and active recruitment of women and minority school leaders. Education's legitimacy crisis will not be solved by putting black faces and skirts on the same old kind of leadership. When women and minorities are trained to fit into the administrative culture, they are often programmed to forget valuable attributes, qualities, and values. Intelligent, motivated educators are more likely to leave the profession, rather than alter their identities to suit white male leadership norms. Specific structural changes are necessary to achieve equity and quality in school leadership. (84 references) (MLH)",

These include articulation of organizational goals, such as ensuring an orderly environment conducive to learning and cultivating responsible student behavior and good character. The school's control mechanisms (evaluation, supervision, rewards, sanctions, and coordination) help facilitate achievement of school goals. Four additional elements (complexity, centralization, formalization, and stratification) are linked to organizational outcomes, along with constructs such as organizational culture and school climate. Three school-based strategies are categorized according to direct and indirect effects on student behavior and  influence on teacher effectiveness. Relevant research studies, organized according to focus and methodology, are discussed and then summarized in a table. Research categories include school effectiveness studies, reanalysis of large data-sets, survey and case study research, alternative schools research, and district-sponsored studies of local discipline programs. No single strategy is universally effective. A future agenda raises several issues regarding research validity, effective organizational strategy, and the impact of school discipline plans.

The Instructional Decision Support System, used in a cooperative venture involving the Wissahickon School District (Pennsylvania) and the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education, was designed to develop more effective inquiry strategies for understanding the relationship between achievement and demographic variables and their effects on student achievement. Because the traditional reliance on &quot;measures of the average&quot; hides more than it reveals, the project attempts to help administrators and teachers go  beyond averages, rates, and percentages to evaluate both student progress and educational program effectiveness. By enabling educators to disaggregate individual experience from the total population, it is possible to understand how district initiatives affect individual students or subgroups. The project developed &quot;display analysis&quot; techniques for graphically depicting one or more variables for a target population. The displays allow educators to analyze the fit between programs, student population, and various subgroups. Further analysis can then occur using additional data, including staff's personal knowledge about students. (MLH)",

A study was conducted to inventory the requirements for state certification of superintendents, to identify the similarities and differences between and among the states, and to compare the current status of superintendent certification to recommendations for improving the preservice preparation of school administrators. Requests for a detailed explanation of superintendent certification requirements were sent to the chief certification officers at state departments of education in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The response rate was 100 percent. The results indicated that no two states had exactly the same standards for the certification of superintendents; however,  categories of requirements common to many states were identified from an analysis of the documents provided by the state education agencies. Specifically: (1) 41 states required the completion of a specific graduate degree as a requirement for certification of superintendents; (2) 22 states reported a specific number of graduate hours required for certification; (3) 38 state education agencies identified specific course requirements; and (4) only 26 of the 51 departments of education required a specific number of years of classroom experience.

Since this population's needs could not be addressed independently, each state was expected to develop collaborative organizational structures and processes through appointment of an Interagency Coordinating Council. Relatively autonomous state and local agencies were now being asked to become interdependent and establish ways to share or reallocate existing resources. The study summarized in this report examines the ability of state agencies to collaborate and factors contributing to interagency effectiveness. Over an 18-month period, 3 interagency units within a single  state were examined: (1) the Interagency Coordinating Committee; (2) the Interagency Placement Committee (for coordinating placement of acutely disabled children); and (3) the Interagency Committee for Children with Special Needs. The interagency units were analyzed according to eight effectiveness factors: objectives, policies, structure, resources, loyalty, agreement, decision-making, and personnel roles. They were also ranked on a continuum of cooperation-coordination-collaboration. The first two units were judged as effectively collaborative; the third was considered dysfunctional. Findings show that collaboration is not always an appropriate interagency strategy. Other conclusions are discussed at length. (MLH)",

The provision of choice in education is the cornerstone to restructuring education in this country. Opportunities offered by choice have benefited students at the Jose Feliciano School for the Performing Arts in East Harlem, New York. Minnesota has been putting the nation's most ambitious statewide choice program in effect since 1985. Iowa and Arkansas have enacted open enrollment legislation, and it is reported that 21 states are considering choice programs. According to Charles Glenn, civil rights director, Massachusetts Department of Education, choice can promote equity&quot; by creating conditions  that encourage schools to become more effective...by allowing schools to specialize and thus to meet the needs of some students very well rather than all students at a level of minimum adequacy, and...by increasing the influence of parents over the education of their children in a way which is largely conflict free.&quot; Choices at the postsecondary level of education in the United States have helped to produce the highest caliber educational system. The same approach can promote progress and success for our elementary and secondary schools. In order to provide momentum in the national effort on choice in education, several federal initiatives are announced along with four publications that concentrate on the theory and practice of choice. Finally, a 3-year evaluation to be conducted of the  impact of Minnesota's open-enrollment choice program is announced. (MLF)",

This paper views school principals as a key component of educational progress. If the current government's modernization policy included education, it would first be necessary to consider changes related to students and teachers. These two changes are difficult, costly, and politically sensitive. Principals, among the third category of changes, can be important catalysts for change, as research shows. Only a limited number of studies on school principals have been conducted in Mexico and other Latin American countries. In Mexico, principals are appointed using an obsolete ladder merit system that hinders consideration of  administrative and leadership skills. This system is bureaucratic and seniority-driven, as shown in a recent Mexicali study. The same investigation revealed that principals delegated heavy workloads to assistant principals and that women secondary school administrators were practically nonexistent. A major problem is lack of a mechanism for organizing information and disseminating it to the professional public. A research agenda is proposed that focuses on (1) information gathering and dissemination (through ERIC); (2) ideal principal profiles; (3) diagnosis of principals' differences; (4) cultural and organizational change; (5) the role of professional organizations; and (6) professional preparation alternatives.

These presentations were the result of long hours of intense, often heated discussion, out of which a spirit of cooperation finally emerged, so that the groups achieved consensus of a philosophy and on alternative models for shared decision-making. All groups recognized that no one model was appropriate for every school, and some groups created a generic model that a school could adapt to suit its own environment. The groups all saw the need for a diversity of models. Each group's special contribution to the seminar is evident in their reports.

The final section presents a general design for implementing any of the instructional organization models.

The study summarized in this paper focuses on principals' perceptions of how their involvement in the Peer-Assisted Leadership (PAL) Program has affected their ongoing actions and attitudes. To determine if PAL's reported short-term effects erode over time, participants were surveyed concerning the program's effects on three domains: (1) leadership and administrative actions; (2) perspectives on their leadership role; and (3) sense of collegiality and group support since being in PAL. Designed to help participants reduce feelings of professional isolation, form collegial support systems, and rethink their leadership roles, the program incorporated  two major data collection strategies (shadowing and reflective interviewing) and instructional leadership as a conceptual framework. All 75 principals and vice-principals who participated in PAL over the past 3 years were included in the sample. Data were displayed and analyzed for each of three groups (continuing principals, those who had not participated for 1 year, and those who had not participated for 2 or 3 years). Results revealed that the influence of PAL is most strongly felt by principals who continue to work formally with their original set of peers. Significant differences between the degree of influence scores for principals in the continuing group and the two non-continuing groups occur for all three of the domains. Effects are strongest for continuing principals. Study  limitations and implications for further research are discussed. Three figures, three tables and the PAL survey questionnaire are attached.

The report summarizes how various grant programs have been prepared and how funds were applied at schools. The report also identifies factors that enhance or inhibit use of these funds; describes the impact of these grant dollars on schools, teachers, and administrators; and recommends new legislation to improve this grant program's design and implementation. From interviews with teachers and administrators in 35 California schools, researchers concluded that: (1) adoption/expansion grants promoted school-level planning for, and implementation of, educational technology; (2) school-site efforts were designed  to meet locally defined needs; (3) small grants resulted in small-scale startup efforts or modest expansions; (4) some schools were able to leverage other fiscal resources; and (5) schools did not adopt model technology programs from other schools. The grant program encouraged decentralized decision-making and increased teacher and administrator control over the design and implementation of programs to incorporate appropriate technology in schools. However, the program's low visibility and the lack of school-collected data continues to limit public awareness of this program and its benefits.

The Far West Laboratory was engaged to design a survey of ACSA members. A questionnaire was designed and circulated to a 25 percent random sample of active ACSA members (3,105 administrators) in November 1986. The usable response rate was 1,275, or 10.3 percent of the active ACSA membership. The questionnaire consisted of 97 questions covering 11 areas of labor relations practice, experience, and opinion. The data demonstrate that administrators are broadly experienced with the basic elements of labor relations: proposal development, negotiations,  contract administration, and grievance resolution. However, considerable confusion was found concerning the &quot;confidential employee&quot; concept and the identity of the chief management spokesperson in teacher negotiations. Many administrators disclosed knowledge gaps regarding negotiations history and contract content. Administrators seemed less troubled than expected by collective bargaining. Although unenthusiastic about collective bargaining's contribution to education, administrators do feel that cooperation is possible and that teacher organizations could provide significant leadership in schools. Further examination of interrelationships among responses, such as the &quot;trust syndrome&quot; covered in this report, is recommended. Two appendices contain the survey instrument and data tables.  (MLH)",

After providing definitions of terminology associated with school choice, the report summarizes state efforts to promote choice through local options (magnet and alternative schools) and metropolitan, limited, or comprehensive open entrollment plans. The third section describes major studies of several programs in Minnesota and Washington, the St. Louis and Wisconsin desegregation-choice plans, magnet schools in four large cities (Boston, Chicago,  Philadelphia, and New York), and choice plans in Masachusetts and East Harlem, New York. The studies show mixed results, but do not necessarily contradict one another. A consensus is emerging concerning certain desirable features of public school choice plans. Prospects for expanding the state role in developing such plans is encouraging. The choice concept is gaining support from the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association. The federal government has spent millions of dollars to help districts establish magnet schools and has supported research on the design and impact of choice plans. (44 references) (MLH)",

This report reviews the value and potential of various proposals to change the instruction of at-risk students from a pedagogy of minimal basic skills to a pedagogy of learning that is critical, diagnostic, adaptable, and long-lasting. The report categorizes restructuring efforts, identifies elements within each category, and discusses how their restructuring could lead to improved learning for all students. The first of three sections examines state school restructuring efforts. The second section reviews district level initiatives, and the third section outlines several restructuring projects promoted by national  organizations and individuals. The sections discussing state and district initiatives focus on four educational variables: (1) school governance changes, involving decentralization of authority to the school site and flexible enrollment options; (2) the nature and organization of curriculum and instruction, or efforts to provide a creative, flexible, and challenging education for all students; (3) new professional roles for educators; and (4) accountability emphasizing performance-based outcomes.

        "description":"Because schools must still respond to federal reporting requirements while exercising greater responsibility for funding and administering local programs that were once under state and federal administration, and because of the increased public outcry for local accountability, many school districts have maintained large central administrative staffs and reduced teaching staffs. Research on effective schools indicates, however, that the most important unit for true change is the individual school. This document examines the relationship between greater recognition for effective schools and increased teacher involvement in the decisions that contribute to that excellence. The West Virginia Education Association and the Appalachian Education Laboratory (WVEA-AEL) surveyed the  principals and teachers of the 68 elementary, middle, and secondary schools recognized as exemplary since 1982 by the West Virginia Department of Education. The response rate was approximately 39 percent. Findings from both teachers and principals indicate significantly greater teacher involvement in decisionmaking than commonly reported in the literature. It appears that, in the process of achieving exemplary school status, the faculties of the schools embraced collaborative decisionmaking strategies. The WVEA-AEL survey respondents, the survey, and the percentage of teachers' and principals' responses are appended. The bibliography contains 138 references. (KM)",

This chapter explores the implications for educational equity of ability grouping. Concerns about equity are organized by placing them in the context of the meaning of educational equity that implies equality of results across population subgroups, and equality of access with respect to the population as a whole. Research on the effects of grouping and tracking reveals that ability grouping in particular seems to affect equity. At the elementary school level, it leads to greater inequality of results, but may occur in concert with higher achievement at all ranks. In secondary schools ability grouping seems to have the most severe  consequences for inequality. Future research might evaluate the likelihood of effective instruction in low-track classes along with the prospects for maintaining high achievement for the strongest students with the use of cooperative learning in heterogeneous classes.

And when adjustments are made for enrollment size, America drops to 14th place. When only public spending levels on education are compared, again the United States ranks 14th of the 16 industrialized nations. America's comparatively weak investment in K-12 education is not the result of an efficient administrative  structure or favorable demographics; instead, due to the unique characteristics of the American school system and society, the United States might be expected to spend proportionately more than other countries. The spending gap appears particularly wide between the youngest American and foreign children. Many of our competitors have a stronger commitment to early childhood education, and some have nearly universal prekindergarten enrollments. Given the investment level in elementary and secondary education, it is not surprising that America is also slipping behind in comparative performance measures. The methodology for comparing expenditures and the education share of national spending are appended. (10 tables, 16 endnotes, 5 references) (KM)",

The EPI calculates a country's education spending as the ratio of that country's educational expenditures to its national income. A superior method for equating education expenditure levels among countries is Purchasing Power Parity. When this method is used to equate per-student expenditures across nations, the ranking of countries changes dramatically from the EPI analysis. Because private spending constitutes a significant share of America's preprimary education, total U.S.  spending for preprimary education is understated in the EPI report relative to the spending of other nations in which preprimary education is publicly supported. When pre-K through 12 spending is accurately compared to other nations, the U.S. ranks second only to Switzerland out of 22 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. A comparative review of 187 studies of the relationship between spending and achievement scores uncovered no significant correlation between the two; thus, the discussion on how to improve education must focus on how to improve the use of resources.

Interest group politics are also examined, especially as practiced at the state level by professional associations representing teachers, administrators, and school board members. The first chapter examines the failure of the microcomputer to transform the traditional role of the teacher in the schools and then assesses the promise of interactive distance learning to do so. The primary conclusion reached is that only technologies like interactive distance learning, with its capacity to offer an educationally viable and cost-effective alternative to the classroom teacher, will have a real impact on schools. The second chapter  describes the technology of interactive distance learning and state-level providers of distance learning services as well as the federal role in distance learning. The third chapter analyzes, at each of the three educational governance levels, political and legal issues that have been raised by distance learning. In the years ahead teacher unions may find themselves in some difficult political battles either to prevent school districts from obtaining and expanding interactive distance learning instruction or to compensate teachers for mastering its use.

        "description":"A framework for curriculum design and a set of guidelines for curriculum development in gifted education are presented. The major dimensions guiding curriculum development for gifted students are: content, process, product, and learning environment. Curriculum content should be developed in such a way that it becomes more abstract, complex, varied, organized in larger chunks, economical with regard to details, comprehensive, and relevant for the future. Processes should include questioning strategies, open-ended activities, discovery learning, reasoning, student freedom of choice, active interaction among students, contact with mentors, fast pacing, and a constant varying of methods. Products should address real problems, communicate to real audiences, transform information, and  be evaluated from several points of view. The learning environment should be student-centered, designed to foster student independence, open to new ideas, accepting, complex, and highly mobile. A series of teaching activities is described illustrating implementation of these educational principles in the areas of economics, historical research, and robotics. Includes five references.

        "description":"A rationale is presented for the systematic evaluation of gifted/talented education programs, citing the consequences of failure to carry out such evaluation. Historically, evaluation of gifted programs was not emphasized, as the evaluation process involved experimental designs, control groups, and parametric statistics which could only be understood by select statisticians or experimental psychologists. A new subscience has emerged which focuses not only on student outcomes but also on program delivery processes, program milieu, resource inputs, and other factors. Fourteen pitfalls to be avoided in the program evaluation process are explored. These pitfalls include failing to recognize assumptions, avoiding \"hard\" or \"uncomfortable\" issues, and assuming that qualitative  evaluation will be easier than quantitative evaluation.

The publication contains tables and figures presenting data on the percentages of youth served by handicapping condition at the state level for four age cohorts (3-5, 6-11, 12-17, and 18-21). In addition, the &quot;High School and Beyond&quot; (HSB) database is used to portray comparisons of independent living and employment rates for youth with and without handicaps, and to depict differences among six specific handicapping condition groups. An introduction to the secondary analysis of extant data sources is provided. The development of a district-based longitudinal study of special  education graduates is outlined, focusing on what students do after leaving school, the types of jobs they obtain, and parts of the special education program contributing to their successful transition. The development and analysis of a set of independent living scales is also described, based on the HSB database, and the relationships of independent living with employment, educational outcomes, and demographic factors are determined. References accompany each chapter. Appendices contain supporting data and details concerning the research methodology. (JDD)",

        "description":"Learned helplessness is an insidious condition involving undeveloped executive functioning, lack of persistence, and an undeveloped sense of connecting new words or concepts into a web of meanings. Remedial teaching in most small-group, diagnostic/prescriptive settings encourages continued learned helplessness because students are dependent on the teacher for guidance, and the accent is on content rather than learning strategies. The active learning environment used at Ben Bronz Academy, a secondary school for learning-disabled students in West Hartford, Connecticut, is a multi-faceted system built on a framework of metacognitive theory. It is designed to break the learned helplessness habit by constantly making the student aware of his passive style and helping him develop  concrete tasks to substitute in its place. At Ben Bronz Academy, these deficit functions are mediated in two ways: the Instrumental Enrichment Program and the Active Learning Environment. In the Instrumental Enrichment Program, students learn problem-solving strategies through self-monitoring and self-mediation. The Active Learning Environment emphasizes metacognition, a point system to provide feedback on behavior, independence activities, hierarchies of strategies for important tasks, and a self-monitoring disciplinary system. A seven-item bibliography is included. (JDD)",

The mothers and fathers were administered the Mother-Child Relationship Evaluation (MCRE) to evaluate parental attitudes. Each parent and child participated in a 10-minute interactive play activity. The child's language level was estimated by the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised. No significant differences were found between the mothers' and the fathers' attitudes. No significant differences were found between parents of normal hearing children and parents of hearing-impaired children on any of the four attitude scales of the MCRE. However, a significant difference was found between the two groups of children in terms of estimated language level, with  hearing-impaired children being less advanced. Results also showed that parents of normal hearing children used more verbal communication which was longer and more sophisticated, while parents of hearing-impaired children used more nonverbal communication. However, only 30% of the nonverbal communication was in the form of sign language, the mode of communication necessary for the hearing-impaired children. Includes 20 references. (Author/JDD)",

Detailed eco-behavioral data were collected on a sample of one &quot;active&quot; student, one &quot;passive&quot; student, and two controls. Data for all four students showed that the most frequently occurring composite throughout observed lessons was active academic response, followed by passive response and competing behaviors. The entire population of 70 students and 15 teachers was queried concerning satisfaction with the program. Students frequently praised the teachers for their help and reported progress academically, behaviorally, socially, and emotionally. Teachers reported student academic  progress, support from the administration, and an overall pleasant school atmosphere. Achievement data from past cohorts (N=73) showed a weak trend in gain scores from pre-test to post-test. The 21 out of 79 former students who were able to be contacted appeared to be functioning at an average level.

Following an overview of the concept of culture and how that concept may be understood and used by human service providers, specific cultural issues are discussed, such as family definitions, roles, relationships, and child-rearing techniques; health, illness, and disability beliefs and traditions; and communication and interactional styles. This information is then used as a basis for suggesting strategies which states might consider in their efforts to enhance cultural sensitivity in services. The  strategies focus on data collection, family participation in policy making and program design, public awareness, working with individual families, staffing, monitoring, and evaluation.

Discussed are goals of a tracking system, cost versus benefit of a tracking system, criteria for inclusion, criteria for discharge, instruments  and techniques needed for optimal tracking and linkage to services, agency responsibility, and the role of parents. Appendices provide, for each of the 15 states, an outline of the system's purpose, a description, a discussion of issues/barriers, plans for the future, and sample forms.

Questionnaires were analyzed to determine the number of positive and negative nominations from peers received by each child. HVR children (N=49) received many nominations, with the number of negative nominations outweighing the number of positive nominations, while LVR children (N=50) received few nominations, with negative nominations also outweighing positive nominations. Parents and teachers also rated the students in each group on specific social skills and general behavior problems and the identified children also rated themselves. The major finding was that HVR  children were generally rated as having poorer social skills, more conduct problems, and more withdrawal than LVR children who were rated as having more social and behavioral problems than a comparison group. Other findings included that both groups of rejected children often preferred to do activities alone or with an adult rather than with same age peers, in contrast to comparison children who more often preferred doing activities with same age peers.

In the first section seven key characteristics of a good high school are identified: (1) integrated; (2) age appropriate; (3) community-based; (4) future-oriented; (5) comprehensive; (6) parent involving; and (7) effective. For each characteristic, a brief explanation is provided with a rationale and a list of indicators on which to judge the program. In the second section three areas of parent collaboration with the school are discussed. They are: the IEP (Individualized Education Program) process, transition planning, and monitoring and advocacy. Parent involvement in these three areas  requires preparation for the IEP meeting and followup with home, school, and community goals; participation in development of the Individual Transition Plan; and ongoing parental monitoring of service quality of the various agencies serving the young adult.

Reasons for the movement's growth and methods of implementing school choice plans are presented. The paper then focuses specifically on interdistrict school choice plans, identifying major aspects which are likely to affect special education programs and the ability of students with handicaps to participate in these types of choice programs. Five major issues are discussed: (1) responsibilities of the resident district; (2) criteria for student admission to nonresident school districts; (3) due process; (4) finance; and (5) transportation. The report discusses each of the major issue areas as they relate to special education and describes how  each area has been addressed in five states with interdistrict choice plans (Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Ohio).

Groups of 29 each of DS adolescents, non-DS mentally retarded (MR) adolescents, and nonretarded children were statistically matched on receptive vocabulary ability; DS and MR groups were also matched for chronological age. The DS and MR groups had mean chronological ages of 209.6 and 209.8 months, respectively. The mean chronological age of the nonretarded group was 62.6 months; the mean age equivalence scores of the two adolescent groups were 56.7 months (DS) and 57.9 months (MR). Subjects were tested on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised, a nonverbal test of receptive language. Multivariate analyses indicated that DS and MR groups did not  differ in understanding of the words in any category and in fact showed higher levels of comprehension than the nonretarded group in two categories, implying that DS individuals do not show specific deficiencies in vocabulary comprehension.

A conceptual framework is presented for linking educational outcomes more closely with improved adult life expectations. The framework seeks to encourage local education agencies to review their traditional curricula and develop transition programs which provide greater real-world opportunities for students with severe disabilities. Following a discussion of the historical development of transition, various transition models are described. Current practices and problems in transition programming are outlined, focusing on four key issues: curriculum, coordination, teacher preparation, and  employment options. Ten policy recommendations are offered for promoting a statewide transition initiative. A separate executive summary of the paper is attached, under the title &quot;Preparing for Transition: Helping Young People with Severe Disabilities to Prepare for Life.&quot; The executive summary provides background information and an identification of the problem, lists important ingredients of successful transition programs, and asks 15 questions to evaluate the effectiveness of secondary educational programs.

Three sections outline justifications for the use of songs to develop cognitive skills, demonstrate the relationship of language rhythm and song rhythm, and to teach a second or third language. Subsequent sections address the following topics: arguments validating song use, based on classroom experiments; five classroom experiments gradually developing specific listening skills and rhythmic acuity; a repertoire of songs for classroom use; and classification of songs according to  different phonetic phenomena occurring within them.

        "description":"It is proposed that many students are unable to distinguish between unguarded writing patterns and literate or expository ones, and it is becoming increasingly necessary in writing instruction to clarify and impose the distinction between these patterns. This problem is confounded by current trends toward exclusively spoken language in the classroom and the use of culturally authentic oral patterns. The common element in written and oral language is the need for economy, which can be exploited to systematically address the disorderliness of unguarded language. A long and relatively complex sentence can be analyzed for simple elements: action and action verbs, responsible agents and victims, and referents. This information can be restructured into a simpler version of the story.  Another exercise has students seeking the essential words in a page or passage, at first by guided searching and later without guidance. The resulting list of verbs and nouns can be reconstituted into sentences and paragraphs, with themes and conclusions. An additional strategy uses the vocabulary relating to familiar movies, which students write into sentences explaining the movie stories, manipulating forms and syntax through drills, and adding and changing phrases. Another approach uses analysis of word clustering and sentence formulas in a passage. (MSE)",

The three text types examined are: (1) the information text, which may be linguistically difficult for the student, but can be understood if the student consciously activates schemata and processes top-down; (2) the input text, so called because its function is to input text in the learning process; and (3) the grammatical display text, which may include  textbook dialogues or chapter texts because they are explanatory only. Passages from German texts are used to distinguish the uses of the various text types. Selection of textbooks and authentic texts is discussed. A brief bibliography is included. (MSE)",

The method uses a bag containing a variety of objects. The objects are drawn out of the bag and discussed in class. The contents of the bag should be unpredictable and unusual, and they should be changed frequently as the students' vocabulary increases. In addition, the items in the bag should reflect as much morphological diversity as possible. A sample collection of toy animals is used to illustrate how the bag's contents can be instrumental in teaching a variety of grammatical points in German. For example, toy animals may be used to demonstrate gender, and clusters of similar-gender animals can illustrate different plural forms.  Each student can be given an animal at the beginning of class for practice in expressing ownership and attributes. The objects can enliven grammar points by allowing students to focus on something concrete rather than the standard fictions and marginally credible characters of textbooks. Additional uses for the objects in more traditional drills and exercises are also noted. (MSE)",

        "description":"The adoption of proficiency-based principles in second language teaching does not mean using a new method of instruction, but rather providing maximum opportunities for students to perform communicative linguistic tasks in a variety of contexts and with a given degree of accuracy. This definition has implications for the learning and teaching processes. Students need to internalize vocabulary in order to understand and access it effectively, and need to develop personalized vocabulary in order to talk about their own worlds. Grammar can be more effectively taught as a means of communication if it is integrated with functions and contexts. Students will gain better control over structures and retain them longer if they practice with small chunks of grammar. An effective way to  select grammar is to examine the frequency of structures in authentic discourse. Opportunities for developing thinking skills and communication can be maximized by using pair and group work techniques. In beginning language instruction, students internalize grammar and vocabulary more quickly and easily if exposed to oral input prior to seeing written language. From the beginning, students should be taught strategies for listening, and should have exposure to authentic listening and reading materials. Sample French vocabulary and Spanish grammar lessons incorporating these principles are presented. (MSE)",

        "description":"Foreign language aptitude was the subject of much research in the 1950s and has been the subject of intermittent research for the last 30 years. Aptitude is measured by the amount of time it takes an individual to learn. Foreign language aptitude appears to differ from general aptitude or intelligence. One theory states that foreign language aptitude consists of four cognitive abilities: (1) phonetic coding, or the ability to segment and identify distinct sounds, form associations between the sounds and their symbols, and retain these associations; (2) grammatical sensitivity, or the ability to recognize the grammatical function of words or other linguistic structures in sentences; (3) rote learning ability in foreign language situations; and (4) inductive language learning  ability, or the ability to infer the rules governing language use. Several tests of foreign language ability are in use today for a variety of purposes in government and education. Concerns about the age of currently used language aptitude tests and the need to incorporate new knowledge of aptitude into test design suggest a need for research, test development, and data collection and analysis. The concept of language aptitude may need to be expanded and refined. (MSE)",

Composition exercises progress from recognition to controlled writing and on to independent writing. Students begin by learning basic sentence patterns and move on to paragraphs. It is intended that the units be followed in sequence. Three  modes of discourse (narrative, process, and examples) were chosen for their broad applicability to tasks encountered by students in early stages of academic work.

The same functional motivations underlying adult speech to other adults also shape adult speech to children. These include pedagogy, control, affection, social exchange, and information-giving. In each of these ares, baby talk is a coherent language style used with both children and adults, and it arises for identifiable, logical reasons. While use of an isolated baby talk feature may temporarily slow emergence of a specific linguistic construction, overall, as a speech register, it has never been shown to hamper linguistic growth. Research has addressed only the pedagogical function of baby talk. Every parent  must evaluate the efficacy of baby talk, especially when it functions for control or as an expression of affection. Baby talk for social interaction does both foster language development and benefit the parent. (MSE)",

However, dialect study as language study in its own right introduces dialects as resources for learning about language and culture, with potential for language arts education. Systematic introduction of dialect diversity in the language arts curriculum can be used to: (1) challenge popular myths about dialects; (2) offer a new perspective on the nature of language; and (3) develop critical thinking skills. Studying dialects does not threaten the sovereignty of Standard English, but instead offers an understanding of the reasons for learning this variety. Although the themes in a curriculum unit on dialects vary depending on level, topics should be  included concerning the naturalness of American English dialects, dialect patterning and rule government, dialect levels, and dialect consequences. Learning about dialects is accomplished most efficiently through active learning supported by a variety of audio-visual aids, several of which are available commercially. A sample exercise about dialect patterning in Southern vowel pronunciation illustrates another kind of learning activity; the range of possible class projects is broad and varied. Appropriate levels for dialect study range from mid-elementary to upper secondary education. (MSE)",

Specifically, the study looked at field dependence vs. independence, possible differences in strategies employed by the two groups when using a word processor, the effects of strategy on the types of revisions made, and the types of revisions and cognitive strategies generating the best written compositions. Subjects were eight fourth-grade mainstream students at similar achievement levels, four of whom were Spanish-English bilingual, and four who used no Spanish at all. Students had access to a word processor in the classroom, were familiar with computers, and had participated in typing instruction. In two sessions, subjects wrote assignments and made revisions. The students answered a  questionnaire about the strategies used during the writing process, and the papers were examined for revision types. Finished compositions were externally evaluated. Results did not substantiate tendencies toward field dependence or independence based on bilingualism. When using the computer to compose, bilingual students used stronger (more effective, according to research) skills than did their monolingual counterparts, and used more process strategies. Bilinguals performed more revisions between drafts, usually through insertion or single word changes. Independent analysis favored the compositions of bilinguals by a significant margin. (MSE)",

The program also helped parents develop English skills at parent literacy centers. About 1,250 students from 20 countries participated, including newly-arrived immigrants and limited-English-proficient (LEP) students already enrolled in high school bilingual or ESL programs. Thirty of 34 participating schools had an ESL component consisting of a classroom-based curriculum in July  and a choice of a 2-week cultural program or 4-week internship in August. Students received credit if they took the Occupational Education examination administered to all participants and successfully completed the program. Few LEP students took the exam and a small proportion passed. Program weaknesses include tying the ESL curriculum to an occupational education course, isolating cultural experiences in a separate, optional unit, lengthy student preparation for the program, and inadequately trained teachers. Strengths include staff commitment and staff development resources. A variety of recommendations for improvement are made. (MSE)",

Curriculum development teams worked on independent activities. The project had 10 proposed curriculum initiatives, but the teams attempted 14 individual projects. One project was completed by the end of the funding cycle, two were completed after the funding period, one was dropped to avoid duplication of efforts, several were very close to completion, and the remaining projects were drafted with a projected 1988 completion date. Recommendations for program improvement include selection of more projects that focus on updating rather than developing curricula,  concentration on fewer projects using more full-time staff, appointment of a review panel to guide and advise project staff, requiring dissemination of products by all projects, use of word processing to speed publication, and additional printing resources for more timely production.

Some complexities of educational equity are explored and equity issues in literacy education of language minority students are analyzed from four perspectives: individual student differences; sociocultural factors; language issues; and curriculum and instruction. It is concluded that perceptions of students as individuals must be balanced with perceptions of them as members of social and cultural groups, and that the well-documented mismatch between home and  school language use for non-mainstream students causes difficulties because school expectations are based on mainstream language patterns; it does not indicate a lack of interest in or preparation for school. Few educational programs tap and develop native language abilities among bilingual students, and non-European content is generally absent from curricula. Literacy education for language minority students generally relies on strategies designed for mainstream students but with more emphasis on correctness and basic skills. Suggestions for making literacy education more equitable are offered. (Author/MSE)",

Specific features of legal language and its functions within the legal community and society are identified. As a primary tool of the legal profession, legal language is viewed as carrying a substantial social and linguistic burden. In addition, it is seen as serving separating, unifying, and prestige functions. It is proposed that these two factors explain why attempts at simplification are likely to be resisted. Legal language appears to have some features of a changing, living dialect, and while traditional scholars have focused only on legal vocabulary, research has demonstrated an evolution of  legal terms through litigation and appeal that is analogous to the historical development of ordinary English. Recent research suggests that there is more to legal language than lexicon. Some of the attempts to simplify legal language and some research studies on the comprehension of non-legal language are examined for the insights they provide into linguistic barriers to comprehension of legal language. Areas of research are identified. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"Efforts to simplify language used in consumer documents come from the consumer movement and a public disillusioned with big business and government. Even before President Carter's 1978 executive order mandating simplification in government regulations, some agencies were revising regulations for clarity. However, these efforts were based on too little knowledge of language complexity. The little existing research on legal language suggests that, more than by a specialized vocabulary, it is characterized by overly complex sentences, the overuse of passives, whiz-deletion and unclear pronoun reference, archaic and misplaced prepositional phrases, and its own set of articles and demonstrative pronouns. The historical development of legal language is unique, paralleling but  independent of the development of the rest of English. Legal language is both the medium of communication and the primary tool of the legal profession, and is powerful because it carries the force of law. Some of the vagueness and ambiguity of legal language is intentional, reflecting compromise and capitulation to the complexity of issues. Some of these problems persist in the rewriting of regulations. In addition, precedent, often linked to language usage, is central to common law. Attempts to simplify legal language have been through readability formulas and editing, but resistance and inherent language complexity make change difficult. (MSE)",

        "description":"An analysis of high vowel variation in Quebec French shows that the phenomenon can generally be accounted for in terms of stress and syllabic closure. However, it is also proposed that by positing underlying lax high vowels in the language, a more insightful analysis is achieved, suggesting that a process of high vowel tensing is occurring instead. This accounts for several facts that would otherwise appear to be highly implausible, e.g., laxed vowels in stressed closed syllables and lax vowels in open syllables in reduplicated forms. More generally, it is shown that in derivational affixation there is no independent motivation for morphological levels in French, and that an affixation process resembling level ordering is explicable in terms of extrametricality. In support of  extrametricality, evidence from the differing behavior of two forms of the same suffix is presented, suggesting that this difference is phonological, not morphological. The discussion has implications for the question of levels in lexical phonology, with the evidence suggesting that French may have only one lexical level. Further research examining inflectional affixation and compounding is recommended to resolve the question more definitively. (MSE)",

In response to the first, \"Has foreign language education been supportive of bilingual education?\", the proposed answer is that it has not, despite attempts to link the two to justify the existence of foreign language programs. Nonetheless, it is proposed that the survival of both foreign language and bilingual education depends on the encouragement of diversity. The answer to the second question, \"Do foreign language teachers consider that they are preparing bilinguals?\", is that this is not usually the case because bilingualism is thought of as unattainable. It is suggested that bilingualism should be considered a process rather than a goal. The  third question, \"How many language teachers consider themselves to be bilingual or bicultural?\", is seen as answerable only by individual teachers. Teachers are encouraged to examine how many occasions for interaction in the foreign language they teach they have found in recent years, or how native-speaking language teachers can maintain their differences from the dominant American culture. Finally, in answer to \"Is bilingual education affecting foreign language education?\", it is concluded that only time will tell how beneficial the relationship is. (MSE)",

This activity is intended as the culminating activity for a unit of study that has included drill and practice of specific vocabulary and structural items. Within the inherently loose structure that allows for creativity and improvisation, the activity also contains controls that direct students to speak about familiar topics, using known  grammatical structures. These controls are provided by role cards that briefly outline the group situation, the individual role, and the conversations that students must initiate. The teacher-designed cards can be adapted to almost any textbook and accommodate varying levels of proficiency. After some initial surprise, students generally find such activities both engaging and challenging. A series of cards are presented and procedures for their use are explained.

The sequence has grown to three courses in fall 1983, all exceeding minimum enrollment requirements despite selective admission criteria. The success of the sequence has inspired the planning of German and French intensive sequences. The source of success appears to be proficiency-based instruction. The program originated from the desire for language testing reflecting student language ability more accurately than traditional grade and course-completion records. The initial 1-semester, team-taught Spanish course was designed to address this need. Upon approval, the course was publicized widely. General course  structure and the division of responsibilities in the team teaching is important to the success of these courses. Each course has four instructors: one senior and one junior faculty member and two native-speaking graduate assistants. The first course awards seven credit hours, which fulfills the college's language requirements. Two subsequent courses award six hours each. Materials include a traditional grammar book and workbook and a local Spanish-language newspaper. Language-related activities outside class provide speaking opportunities. The program has reversed a department enrollment decline and improved department status. Followup courses are needed. Additional program development is foreseen. (MSE)",

The second approach uses the association of the material being studied with quotations from other sources, either by the same author or a different one. A comparison of quotations of French and non-French authors helps to demonstrate the universality of the French material and demonstrates the possibility of integrating two academic disciplines. A third method evolves from the extension of the coupling of two text types, and results in the organization of and active participation by the student in the  concepts to be learned. Students must seek out an excerpt from a text and apply it in a different context. The fourth method involves self-projection by the student into another personality and/or time period.

Learning about computers and their applications to the foreign language instructional process will provide teachers with the information needed to examine issues related to the new technology and stimulate discussion of its implementation in the school. All educators should be aware of the advantages and disadvantages of computer-assisted instruction (CAI). Many computer literacy courses give teachers general knowledge of how computers work, familiarity with terminology, an idea of significant events in the history of computers, and the ability to read and write simple programs. While programming knowledge is not essential to the teacher, it is helpful. CAI is of obvious use in testing and  record-keeping, but can also aid in conducting tutorials, freeing valuable teacher time. In 1982, The University of the District of Columbia foreign language department established a computer committee and began a CAI training course for faculty. The course eliminated all but the essentials of a computer literacy course, in order to stimulate faculty use of computers. Responses to a committee-member designed questionnaire indicated faculty concerns about computer use. The real value of the computer to the foreign language learner lies in the use made of it by the teacher. (MSE)",

        "description":"A review of selected research studies and practices on the teaching of literacy to limited English proficient (LEP) students suggests that there is considerable variation in the way literacy is defined. Several methods currently being used to develop LEP students' literacy skills are reviewed. Many LEP students continue to be taught reading skills through phonics rather than the whole language or language experience approaches. Initial research on grammar-based approaches indicates that they are not as effective as others. Striking similarities appear in the success of both adults and children being taught by the various approaches. Effective LEP adult literacy programs reflect learner needs, educational backgrounds, and abilities, almost invariably integrating a basic skills  focus with instruction in life or survival skills needed for daily functioning. The following guiding principles for facilitating English literacy with LEP students were suggested by G. Wells (1987): (1) responsibility for selecting tasks, deciding on means for attaining goals, and evaluating outcomes; (2) language should be seen as a means for achieving other goals; (3) writing, reading, speaking, and listening should be seen as complementary processes; and (4) an important place should be accorded to the sharing of personal and literary stories at all stages.

The instructional guide describes the LEA process and differences between LEA instruction carried out with native English speakers and LEA used in combination with ESL instruction. The overall learning objectives of the LEA approach are outlined, and its use in groups and in the classroom is discussed. A description of the LEA/ESL method includes sections on story starting techniques, asking questions, the stories themselves, and follow-up  exercises. Some additional information sources and instructional resources are suggested. The ESL reader is divided into Southeast Asian stories and Hispanic stories, and within these groups, into beginning, intermediate, and advanced level lessons.

        "description":"To properly assess the problem of adult literacy in the United States and to develop successful intervention programs, it is critical to view literacy not just as a technical proficiency but as a culturally shaped set of practices engaged in by individuals and groups, literate and illiterate. A successful literacy campaign must incorporate outreach and training strategies reaching into communities of illiterate individuals and meeting their daily needs. Historically, the cultural patterning of literacy practices has been extremely diverse. Immigrants have brought their diverse practices to a highly literacy-oriented culture. It is important to distinguish among three dimensions of literacy practices (technical skills, functional knowledge, and social meaning) to develop adult  education programs that build on existing skills and knowledge and that enhance or create positive attitudes toward learning the technical skills. Individual differences in attitudes toward social meanings of literacy can profoundly influence individual choices concerning literacy learning and use. Educational planning and intervention should consider not only technical reading and writing skill levels but also the functions of literacy in a community. By integrating the coping strategies of non-literate individuals, taking account of attitudes, and exploiting literacy assistance networks, literacy training can be made more effective and more widely accessible.

The curriculum consists of five units: (1) safety and health, (2) workers' compensation, (3) discrimination, (4) unions, and (5) workplace rights. In each unit, workplace issues are represented in the form of two or three short skits, each presenting a specific issue. The skits are transcribed in the workbook and accompanied by preparatory exercises, structured language activities, and guided questions that encourage students to move from the descriptive to  an interpretive level. Because students may need additional facts to inform their responses at the interpretive level, a fact sheet for each unit is appended. An attempt is made to integrate listening, speaking, reading, and writing based on but not limited to the context of the issue.

The United States Merit Systems Protection Board surveyed 72 schools highly rated in seven college curriculums. The seven curriculums were selected because they are significant recruitment sources for the most populous occupations in the federal government which are typically filled by college graduates. Curriculums included were engineering, computer science, law, nursing, accounting, liberal arts, and public administration. Results suggest that the government is not perceived as an \"employer of choice\" by many graduates of some of the country's most highly rated academic institutions. A perception  existed that federal jobs pay less than comparable jobs in the private sector. Even among those graduates who have a positive view of the government as an employer, many are perplexed by the \"civil service hiring labyrinth\" and find little active encouragement on the part of most federal agencies. Recommendations conclude the report. An appendix lists institutions responding to the survey. (JDD)",

It presents the amendment in full and information on the history of the legislation, background and need for the legislation, major provisions of the Bill, votes in committee, cost estimate, the regulatory impact statement, a section-by-section analysis, and a minority view. Justification for the Bill is seen in the poor graduation rate for most student athletes and the small probability that a given student athlete will go on  to a professional athletic career. The Bill will require institutions of higher education to report the following: the number of students at the institution, the number of students receiving athletically related student aid, the average 4-year graduation rate for all students, the average 4-year graduation rate for students receiving athletically related student aid and the number and percentage of students receiving athletically related student aid who earned a bachelor's degree or its equivalent within 10 years of entering the school.

Trends toward increased academic openness and cross fertilization among academic fields after the Cultural Revolution are identified. Reforms during this period are seen to have focused on guiding student energies along lines acceptable to Party reform directions and not deviating essentially from traditional Confucian approaches. The more recent emphasis on money and market forces is considered in the context of its role in steering Chinese society. The model of J. Habermas in his critique of western capitalism is applied to the current situation in China, suggesting that the release of money as a steering  mechanism is shaking up social and cultural patterns and leading to a sense of meaninglessness among university students.

        "description":"It is proposed that, contrary to traditional thinking, interdisciplinary communication can be enhanced, not limited, by specialization. A thorough understanding of common elements within any one discipline provides the bridge between disciplines. Two sets of examples of issues are examined. The first focuses on three disciplines in the social sciences (cognitive science, sociobiology, and behaviorism), and suggests that theories in these disciplines share common ground in terms of providing mechanistic explanations of human intelligence and human development, and critiques of the theories share common ground as they move to reinstate the primacy of such qualities as meaning, intentionality, consciousness, and free will. The second set of examples focuses on how issues pertaining  to objectivity and subjectivity pervade such disciplines as philosophy, moral-development psychology, psychoanalysis, anthropology, sociology, and English literature. Again, common features of critiques are highlighted to illustrate how understandings within one discipline can help with understanding common problems and issues in others. The way in which specialization, and not simply a broad, liberal education, provides a powerful means for interdisciplinary communication is discussed. Includes 47 references. (MSE)",

Much of the empirical data used is drawn from the Sierra Project, a study originating in the 1970s that addressed traditional obstacles in higher education in meeting its responsibility for character development through curriculum intervention and longitudinal research. The study's methodology and results are reported. Specific aspects of character development studied include changes in moral maturity, ego development, and principled thinking during the course of undergraduate study. The ways in which the context for promoting personal development can be changed are examined, and the elements of the Sierra  Project curriculum considered central in this effort are outlined.

The first chapter outlines the university's reaction to the initial union drive to organize faculty or staff. Chapter 2 focuses on the president and board, and deals with key decisions that must be made before beginning negotiations. Beginning with chapter 3, the focus shifts to the president and chief negotiator, and covers the details of the bargaining process, including: gathering data, the  first faculty contract, scope of negotiations, managing the management team, managing time and communication in negotiations, dealing with the news media, managing language in negotiations, suggestions for seven standard contract articles, getting negotiations under way, managing trade-offs in negotiation, strike preparations, dealing with third parties, coming to closure in negotiations, ratifying a tentative agreement, and living with the union.

Stafford loans are low-interest loans based on financial need, while SLS and PLUS loans are not based on financial need. Each loan is insured by one of 55 state or nonprofit guaranty agencies. Guaranty agencies can collect an insurance premium on each loan; they reimburse lenders for 100% of defaulted claims; and they serve as lenders of last resort. The Department of Education administers the program; reinsures the guaranty agencies for 100% of defaulted loans, except in those cases where the agency's default rate exceeds 5%; and  makes interest payments to lenders for Stafford loan borrowers while they are in school. Figures for growth in number of loans, increases in dollar amounts of loans, increases in number of defaults, increases in loans to students attending proprietary schools, and default rates of students attending proprietary schools are provided. The report also notes actions taken by the Congress and the Department of Education to reduce loan defaults, and lists 11 General Accounting Office reports concerning the program. (JDD)",

The Department uses a three-step process to develop its Pell grant budget estimate: a computer cost model incorporating over 30 economic indicators, a series of adjustments to reflect program changes that the model does not include, and budgetary adjustments. Historically, the Department's cost model estimate has been a reasonably accurate predictor of program costs. Factors which contributed to the Department's revision of the fiscal year 1990 budget request are determined, and are attributed to: savings expected to accrue from legislative changes, increased cost model estimates based  on revised economic indicators, increase in number of grant recipients, and lower estimated costs for financial aid administrators' discretion.

This report offers findings concerning the general characteristics of the freshmen, their reasons for choosing UMCP. The survey also gathered data on their academic orientation (including their academic development, school work attitudes, philosophy and objectives, expectations of college courses, reasons for wanting to complete college, and career goals) and their extracurricular pursuits, including leisure time, cultural pastimes, and religion. Selected findings include: half of the students stated that UMCP was their first choice; 33% chose UMCP because of either overall or departmental academic excellence;  Scholastic Aptitude Test scores averaged 1,085 for all incoming freshmen; almost half of the students indicated an interest in educational/vocational counseling; and 10% were interested in emotional/social counseling.

Based on case studies of 10 majority institutions in 8 states, the paper proposes a conceptual scheme for dealing with such issues as the appropriate balance between equality of educational opportunity and distributive justice, state goals with respect to this balance, the role of colleges and universities in state efforts to achieve such goals, estimation of progress toward attainment of these goals, and policy options to encourage all institutions to emphasize both quality and diversity. It also proposes a method for tracking higher education participation and achievement rates for states and for  institutions.

It is concluded that elegant questions about the structures and processes of higher education have been asked and answered, but provide little guidance in decision-making and little practical help in administration, leadership, or pedagogy. The philosophical position of critical social science suggests a whole range of questions which cannot be explored well within the bounds of conventional science, but which can be both asked and examined well utilizing critical theory. Considered are such issues as how the role of values directs and guides higher education research, what the role of moral  discourse is in university life, and what the implications are when the university is considered as a moral entity.

        "description":"An examination of the probability of enrolling in postsecondary education, the likelihood of completing various types of credentials, and the effects of these credentials on wage rates, earnings, and other adult outcomes was conducted using data derived from the National Longitudinal Study of the Class of 1972. The followup survey in 1986 suggested that while enrollment in postsecondary education has been stable, or in some cases increased, the probability of completing a B.A. degree declined. There was shown to be an increased tendency to drop out of postsecondary education, particularly among minority students. Finally, the study indicated that the rate at which adults are enrolling in higher education has apparently increased, but it was difficult to detect the benefits,  either economic or non-economic, for this group. It is concluded that postsecondary education has failed to materialize the great promise of economic and other benefits historically assigned to getting advanced degrees, while higher education policy pretends that the postsecondary market works, with well-informed students facing a labor market that can absorb all its graduates.

The paper analyzes the postsecondary curricular experience using data from the National Longitudinal Study for the Class of 1972 (NLS/72). Four stores of information are identified as the &quot;primary&quot; cultural store and secondary stores corresponding to demographic, cultural-interest, and specialist subgroups and these streams of information are represented by course clusters in: (1) minority and women's studies, (2) popular culture/media, (3) non-western culture and society, and (4) western culture and society. The paper also examines the nature of the institutions in which formal cultural studies are pursued and the demography of students who tend to engage in formal study in one or more of  the cultural literacy clusters. Findings show that one out of five Bachelor's degree recipients in the NLS/72 had no postsecondary exposure to western cultural/social information at all. The lowest participation rates occurred among majors in engineering and applied sciences. Given the NLS/72 generation's limited exposure to its own culture and its even more limited exposure to secondary cultural literacies, it is concluded that this generation seems unsuited to participate in the diversity of world culture and economy.

        "description":"This qualitative study explored college teaching in an \"apprenticeship\" setting, specifically the architectural design studio. The study examined studio teachers' efforts to design effective project assignments and to help students move successfully through those assignments. Two design teachers were interviewed and observed as their students worked for 10 weeks on an urban design problem. The study's findings addressed both project design and teaching strategies. The study found that a good project assignment serves multiple purposes; rests in a theoretical frame that can be generalized to other problems; builds on and meshes with the existing curriculum while providing new opportunities as well; is prototypic; employs the studio product as a learning technique itself; and uses  project presentations not only to communicate results but as a way for thinking through the design process. Strategies for helping students learn from project assignments include making arrangements so students can engage and pursue the task, influencing how students think about the problem, diagnosing students' progress and shaping their problem, structuring the project requirements, simultaneously opening its opportunities and focusing students' thinking, and improvising.

The relationship between academic careers and family responsibilities from the time respondents received their degrees until 1983 were analyzed. Findings showed more flexibility within individual academic career patterns than previously noted in the literature. Some scholars used &quot;hidden passages&quot; to cope with some of the family pressures exerted on academic careers. Such coping mechanisms involved using such accepted academic opportunities as postdoctoral, visiting, or temporary appointments; research leave; part-time work; and  delayed tenure review to accommodate individuals' parental roles in conjunction with academic careers.

Factors contributing to the shortfalls in the southern region are outlined, such as limited incentives in luring young scientists and engineers into graduate work, mobility of graduate degree-holding scientists and engineers, and growing demand. Efforts to encourage more people to seek graduate degrees in these fields focus on industry-based programs, special financial aid programs,  improving student achievement in these fields in the earlier grades, and building students' confidence in their abilities.

It is noted that the goal of the project is to undertake research oriented more towards learning than teaching, in a context where children's choices and their approaches are respected as much as possible. Responses are given to four of the most common questions asked about the project: (1) Why do you have a multi-machine, multi-software environment? (2) How do the children influence the changes that are made to the Vitrine? (3) How is it possible to manage different projects of many children at the same  time? and (4) What type of learning does such an environment encourage? Three challenges for the future of the project are outlined. The paper concludes on a cautionary note, conscious of both the progress that the project has achieved to date through its work with three groups of students (a grade two class from a multi-ethnic and multilingual inner-city neighborhood, a combined fourth and fifth grade class from an upper middle-class francophone neighborhood, and a group of 10 adolescents with serious learning and psychological problems from a provincial health care center) and of the challenges to be faced in the future.

A substudy was undertaken to evaluate the role of linkers, i.e., field-based change agents utilized by the dissemination system to link clients' needs to information contained in the resource base, and to assist in the utilization of this information in the school improvement effort. Data from questionnaires returned by state project directors and 136 identified linkers were examined to: (1) identify linker activities, roles, and types; (2) compare  project directors' and linkers' notions of &quot;real&quot; and &quot;ideal&quot; linker responses; and (3) determine the relationship between linker behavior and project implementation characteristics for particular settings. It was concluded that: (1) three distinct linker roles can be defined but are not adhered to; (2) there is a potential source of conflict between linkers' and directors' desires regarding linker activity; and (3) there is no significant relationship between linker behavior and contextual characteristics. A copy of the linker questionnaire is appended. (13 tables and 10 references) (NRP)",

The introduction to this substudy explains that data collected for the final evaluation were subjected to a scaling analysis to: (1) confirm that indicants grouped together on the basis of their content were, in fact, measuring the same thing; (2) eliminate indicants not related to the other indicants in the facet; (3) parsimoniously summarize a large body of data; and (4) serve as a measuring device, by assigning facet scores to each scale for use in  characterizing state capacity. The four main sections of this report discuss the five-component conceptual framework used to specify and organize the variables which define the process of building state dissemination capacity; the scaling procedures and the application of Rasch scaling analysis; the degree to which the scales provide a developmental perspective to the capacity building process; and interpretation and utilization of the resultant information for program improvement.

The marketplace benefits that flow from an open architecture are then summarized and the additional public policy benefits that could be achieved if ONA principles were applied to local exchange networks of the Bell Operating Companies (BOCs) are described. The Common ONA Model put forth by the BOCs is compared with the definition of a true open architecture, and it is concluded that the Common ONA Model represents a closed rather than an open architecture. Noting that this places the marketplace and regulatory expectations of ONA in  doubt, it is argued that there is little incentive for the BOCs to embrace a true form of open architecture. Another policy option is recommended which suggests abandoning the idea of further unbundling of the local exchange network; instead, it calls for a legislatively mandated program for encouraging--rather than just permitting or, even worse, discouraging--competition in the provision of ordinary local exchange service.

        "description":"The driving force in federal licensing has been the combined political interests of legislators desirous of obtaining valuable prerogatives over the assignment of frequencies; incumbent broadcasters, ever vigilant in restricting new entry into broadcasting; and &quot;public interest&quot; lobbyists, whose self-interests lay in politicizing the assignment process despite the expropriation which their constituents thereby suffered. Hence, a classic rent-seeking competition forged the licensing regime in broadcasting in the 1920s and has steadfastly maintained it since, due to the vector payoffs associated with such a scheme. The support for this thesis is evidence suggesting that the historical rendition of the pre-regulation broadcasting market offered in both the NBC and the Red Lion cases  was largely fanciful, and that a more accurate history of the early broadcasting period reveals that an orderly market was reshaped by political interests to yield rents, not to solve interference. This history shows that physical scarcity and its ancillary justifications for content regulation are ad hoc rationalizations of policies adopted for specified political purposes. Most important for Constitutional considerations is that the means chosen to implement such dealings provoke precisely the same concerns that make government licensing of print unlawful; i.e., politicization of the press produces results antagonistic to the most fundamental First Amendment values.

Focusing on the framework for analysis, the first of three parts of the paper provides some theoretical considerations and tools for analyzing the processes of standardization among the different industries involved in the debate over high resolution systems. Industrial arguments are presented in the second part, which describes both the broadcast  game (including terrestrial broadcasters, satellite and cable television system operators, and some consumer electronics manufacturers) and the electronics infrastructure game (consisting chiefly of U.S.-based computer companies, consumer electronics companies, and semiconductor manufacturers, with limited telephone company participation). The findings of the study are assessed in the third part.

Without adequate assurances that their works will be protected, authors and other copyright owners may be reluctant to allow the full text of their works to be accessed through computer networks. There may also be a hesitancy on the part of users, such as librarians, to avail themselves of the material that may be accessible online, where the terms and conditions of access, if any, are unclear, or where the costs are prohibitive. The development of transactional frameworks for the collection and distribution of royalties in connection with computer networks, including possible mechanisms for obtaining required  permissions online, is by far the most important undertaking in this context. However, there are several related measures that also require clarification in order that computer networks may achieve their promise of wide-spread access to information in electronic form. The paper discusses five issues that require further consideration: (1) ownership of rights in pre-existing works; (2) copyrightability of databases; (3) the Electronic Communications Privacy Act; (4) identification and intellectual property; and (5) digital libraries.

        "description":"Recently the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has been considering modifications to its regulations governing local and national media ownership and has indicated more interest in the efficiency consequences of the regulations, including those that might arise from common ownership of multiple radio stations. This paper seeks to determine whether efficiencies would likely be realized if the FCC relaxed its prohibition of multiple ownership of the same kind of media outlet in a single market. The empirical bases for this investigation are the AM-FM radio combinations permitted by the FCC. The primary focus is a comparison of the prices paid for stations sold as combinations with the prices paid for stations sold as independent stations. The results are consistent with the  existence of efficiencies in joint ownership of multiple stations in the same local market and provide support for the relaxation or repeal of the current FCC restriction on such joint ownership. AM-FM combinations command a price premium over the sum of the prices that would be realized if the stations were sold and operated separately, suggesting that combinations are more efficient. In addition, the number of AM-FM combinations have increased over time, again supporting the hypothesis of greater efficiency for combinations. (23 references) (GL)",

Evaluation criteria such as availability, organizational environment, and educational and operational rationales are also discussed. The following technologies are then discussed: (1) electronic publishing; (2) audiovisual media, including terrestrial broadcast television and radio, videocassettes, satellite, cable, and videodiscs; and (3) computer technology, including teaching  about computers, computers as study tools, educational communications, administration, pre-programmed computer-based learning, and artificial intelligence. It is suggested that home-based learning, center- or work-based learning, and communications within and between systems are likely to dominate distance education during the next 10 years.

Reception and transmission costs, as well as predicted access to satellite transmissions, are then discussed. Uses of satellites for education and training in countries outside of Europe, particularly the program at the National Technological University in the United States, are summarized. Distinctions are drawn between the various media (television, audio, or data) and configurations (point-to-multipoint or network) used. Descriptions of initiatives underway for the use of satellites for training in Western Europe--PACE, OLYMPUS, COMMETT, and DELTA--are presented. The extension of training beyond national boundaries and establishment of a training communications network  are identified as ways satellites could be used. Low cost, easy production, speed, European-wide reach, open access to transmission, security, and funding opportunities are listed as benefits of using satellites. Constraints are also identified: alternative modes of distance training may be cheaper and/or more effective; identification of trans-national training needs and target groups is necessary; specially-designed courses are needed; print and tutorial support and follow-up are important; supporting cost, particularly the cost of production, may be greater than transmission and reception costs; and government will need to ease public telephone company control over tariffs and access to up-links.

        "description":"The JANUS (Joint Academic Network Using Satellite) satellite network is being planned to link European institutions wishing to jointly produce distance teaching materials. Earth stations with capabilities for transmit/receive functions, voice/data functions, two 64 kbs channels, and connection to local telephone exchange and computer networks will be located at each institution. Initially the European Association of Distance Teaching Universities (EADTU) will form the core of the system, but the network is expected to grow to include enterprises concerned with distance training. JANUS will have several functions: (1) two-way communication between sites; (2) audio-conferencing; (3) electronic mail; (4) computer conferencing; and (5) experimental video-conferencing. JANUS is being  designed to reduce travel costs and time, reduce communication costs, speed up joint course production, secure external funding, and improve user-friendliness of electronic messaging and data transfer. Although most functions could be provided by existing services (face-to-face meetings, public telephone systems, public switched packet networks, private data networks, and VSAT satellite networks), there are problems with the cost and quality of service. Issues to be resolved before JANUS becomes operational include earth station design, location of a suitable satellite, development of user-friendly procedures, funding, and regulation of telecommunications services.

The aims and structure of a proposed modern language program are then outlined, and plans for using print, television/video, radio/audiocassette, and software learning materials are briefly described. A summary of some experiences of broadcasting organizations in using media to teach languages at a distance is presented, and it is concluded that other means need to be developed for distance learning. The paper concludes by discussing the problem of choice among a range of media or modes of presentation--text, audio, television, computers, and people--placing the question within the framework of six criteria: access, costs, teaching functions, interaction and control,  organizational issues, and novelty, each one of which is examined in detail.

The more detailed objectives of the paper are to look at how technology may facilitate the joint production of courses across different institutions in different countries; speed up course production; help in the delivery of courses to different target groups in different countries; and suggest prototype course designs that meet the challenge of the first three objectives and might attract some external funding. Factors to be considered in determining the suitability of technology for distance teaching are then  considered, including access and availability to students, costs, teaching functions, interaction and user-friendliness, organizational constraints, and novelty. Scenarios for media use in European courses are also suggested; these include electronic publishing, videocassette courses, tutored video instruction, computer-mediated communication, and computer-based learning with videodiscs. The paper concludes by identifying several policy issues that need to be resolved by the European Association of Distance Teaching Universities before final choices can be made about the use of technology in European-wide courses.

The problem solving aspect of distance learning encourages active involvement by students in teaching-learning situations; student selection of content; teachers as guides and motivators of student learning; ordering of learning experiences in terms of sequential flexible steps of problem solving; and student involvement in curriculum development. The subject centered approach in distance learning stresses the abstract and cognitive rather than the psychomotor and affective dimensions; teacher sequencing of subject matter; a structured curriculum; a teacher-developed curriculum; and student attainment of vital facts and concepts. A third philosophy, measurement-driven instruction,  emphasizes a logical curriculum with teacher selection of sequential objectives; content directed at measurably-stated objectives; appraisal procedures aimed at measurably-stated objectives; and scope and sequence derived from ordered objectives. Student decision-making, a fourth philosophy in distance education, emphasizes that learners should be developing appropriate attitudes and skills in making choices; achieving optimally in making selections; working effectively in groups; becoming responsible individuals; and selecting meaningful tasks.

        "description":"With the assistance of the Canadian Captioning Development Agency, TVOntario has undertaken to determine the efficacy of applying closed-captioned television to the needs of adult learners who are not hearing impaired. In this research study, actual and potential applications of closed-captioned television for hearing audiences in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe, and Australia were explored in order to provide a context to guide development in this area. Following a description of captioning technology and a discussion of the current commitment of Canadian broadcasters to captioned television, the report provides a review of experimental research studies that tested the use of closed-captioned television with adult students of English as a Second Language  and literacy, as well as with learning disabled adults. The results of these studies are discussed in terms of their implications for the development of captioned television for adult learners in Ontario. The adult learner markets for closed-captioned television in Ontario are described in detail, as are the programs currently available to these learners. Issues are raised concerning the learning contexts that are best suited to learning with closed captions, and suggestions are made as to the types of programs and captioning methods that are most conducive to learning. The paper concludes with recommendations for the next phase of research--to conduct a pilot test of the use of captioned video in various classroom learning contexts and with learners of varying capabilities.

The three major goals of the initiative were: (1) to encourage the development of distance education in Ontario by providing an opportunity for adult education institutions and organizations to cooperate in solving problems related to distance education; (2) to enable TVO to become better integrated into the educational community of Ontario; and (3) to increase TVO's awareness of issues and problems that will be of concern in the future. It was not intended that the DEC advise TVO about its programming or recommend materials for broadcast; rather TVO was to act as committee coordinator and member of the subcommittees (whose  areas were basic functionality, francophone, occupational preparation, and maintenance and planning framework), each of which was to provide a forum in which experts could work together to find solutions to specific educational needs in the area of distance education.

Highlights of the findings for schools include: (1) 97% of the public schools had computers for either instructional or administrative use; (2) 51% of the faculty members were rated as computer literate; and (3) the rate of change in the number of computers has slowed in the past two years. Major findings  for districts indicate that all district offices have computers; Apple microcomputers are the most commonly used (39%); the total rate of change was 180% in 1985, 83% in 1986, and 61% in 1987; and 3.8% of all printers were laser printers. Detailed survey findings are presented in tables, charts, and graphs, together with brief descriptions of computer applications in individual schools and school districts.

        "description":"The use of contextualized learning environments with learners who are at risk of school failure arises from the recognition that students who are introduced to concepts and strategies out of a meaningful context will view them as irrelevant to daily life. Contexts created by teachers using videotape and random access videodisc technologies have three advantages: (1) they provide rich sources of information with opportunities to notice various images, features, issues, and problems; (2) they enable students to perceive dynamic moving events; and (3) they allow students to develop skills of pattern recognition related to visual and auditory cues. Anchored instruction projects at Vanderbilt's Learning Technology Center have examined the effectiveness of shared contextualized  learning environments in promoting learning. One study showed that a group of preschool children who viewed a videodisc of a story learned much more than a group who heard the same story read aloud. A second project found that fifth grade students who received instruction in the language arts and social studies within the context of a movie were much more likely to use the new vocabulary, writing skills, and historical information that was presented than students who received the same instruction without the video anchor. Data from such projects offer an opportunity to merge recent knowledge about cognition, instruction, and culture with video technology to develop instructional systems that can make significant improvements in the way the teaching and learning process for at-risk  students is carried out in the schools.

The Model Computerphobia Reduction Program was designed to screen potential computerphobic students in their computer courses at the beginning of a semester and invite them to participate in brief skills-acquisition modules (treatment programs). After screening over 1,600 students, nearly 200 students, faculty, and staff of California State University, Dominquez Hills, volunteered for the program. The many others who needed the program, but chose not to participate, were used as a comparison group. Extensive short- and long-term evaluation, which used measurement scales and qustionnaires completed before and after the program and  6 months later, demonstrated strong, positive results. Highlights of the results include: (1) a 92% completion rate; (2) strong measurable objective and subjective gains; and (3) maintenance of gains over 6 months. Two comparison studies revealed markedly reduced anxiety, enhanced attitudes and cognitive abilities, and drastically reduced course dropout rate and improved course grades. (GL)",

For each subject area, computer programs and textbook passages were used to instruct and model for students how to identify key concepts, compare and contrast concepts, and graphically map relationships among key concepts. One hundred and eighty-four undergraduate students of matched ability from a major university and from a two-year community college were assigned to treatment and control groups to evaluate program effectiveness. Students who used the program significantly outperformed control group students, and learned strategies transferred to new and unmodeled textbook chapters. Data are presented  in tabular form.

        "description":"This paper advocates the introduction of integrated resource centers in the developing sectors of South Africa as a means for creating technologically and media-literate generations in the Post-Apartheid Era. These centers would offer opportunities for students to utilize educational media in all formats, thereby reducing the resistance to technology that arises from a lack of acquaintance with and confidence in modern technologies. It is suggested that academic support units in schools coordinate and cooperate with each other and share their resources and the resultant costs. The resource center is presented as having two components: (1) the library component, which is responsible for the acquisition of materials, the provision of technical services, media utilization, and  information services; and (2) the educational technology component, which is responsible for educational staff and student development, media production, purchasing of hardware, maintenance and repairs, booking, circulation, and rental. The unique needs of South African students are discussed, and the benefits offered by resource centers to these students are assessed. The economic viability of implementing integrated resource centers that provide access to all media is examined, and the principles of resource center staffing and administration are noted.

        "description":"In library instruction, as in any instructional setting, individual learning styles should be addressed to ensure better learning and retention. Historical examination of learning styles research suggests that in order to appreciate the diversity of students' learning styles and to apply this understanding in a library or information environment, instructors must first develop an awareness of learners' modes of reception and analysis of data, and their modes of concept formation and retention. This understanding can then be overlaid by Herman A. Witkin's (1977) model of field independence-dependence, which addresses not only the contrasting modes of information processing strategies, but the extent to which a person's perception of an item (or information) is influenced by the  context in which it appears. Instructors must also recognize the nuances and idiosyncracies of their own learning styles. In conclusion, instructors are advised to: (1) be aware of their own cognitive styles; (2) be aware of the variations in students' cognitive styles; (3) permit flexibility where possible; (4) analyze the ways in which their style may bias their classroom teaching technique and presentation materials; and (5) ascertain if there are preferred styles and strategies necessary for the subject being taught and set up learning processes to help students with these strategies. Two tables list learning characteristics and suggested instructional practices for field dependent and field independent students. (24 references) (NRP)",

This report on the study outlines the various forms networking can take, provides examples of major networks and institutions currently practicing in the field, and ends with some concrete proposals. The main conclusion is that the body of knowledge or discipline termed &quot;social sciences&quot; cannot be separated from other human activity; it is felt that the social sciences in western Europe exclude a wide range of topics that need to be included in developing countries when considering the development of an  information system. It is further concluded that while implementing such a network may be feasible technically, it may not be feasible for institutional, financial, or political reasons. It is also pointed out that there is a shrinking availability of money for such development, and that this is forcing people to be more critical about undertaking such activities. Finally, it is concluded that an incremental improvement of cadre and institution building is needed rather than a grand design, and that such improvement will require a cadre of trained social scientists and information scientists who understand the principles of information system design and can adapt them to the tasks of institution building.

The first of 10 sections in this report presents the statistical data from the Bowdoin List libraries and compares them with Association of Research Libraries (ARL) data. Sections 2 through 5 examine data related to various categories of expenditures for both groups of libraries, and section 6 provides information about the reported state of automation in the college libraries. Information from the interviews with library directors is presented in section 7, and conclusions and acknowledgements in sections 8  and 9. The final portions contain the notes and appendixes, which include a copy of the questionnaire and data from the study. Major findings suggest that: (1) the rule that academic libraries' collections double every 16 years is highly suspect; (2) the time honored 60-30-10 breakdown of salaries, materials, and &quot;other&quot; is no longer the norm; (3) prices for books and periodicals grew more rapidly from 1967 to 1977 than for the ensuing decade; (4) expenditures for both college and academic libraries have exceeded the increases in both the Consumer Price Index and the Higher Education Price Index; (5) the funding for online systems most often comes from outside the library's annual budget; and (6) all directors interviewed believe that the advantages of automation outweigh the  disadvantages.

It is intended to support the direction of library development begun in 1984 to improve services to the user and to meet Library Services and Construction Act (LSCA) priorities where they coincide with needs in Idaho. Section I describes the purpose and development of the plan, while Section II provides information on the administration of the plan, including its goals, policies and priorities, criteria and procedures, coordination of library programs, dissemination of LSCA information, and evaluation of the LSCA program. User and library needs are discussed in Section III, which covers the  library public; unserved areas; public, academic, school, special, and institutional libraries; the State Library Agency; and the Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped. The discussion of public libraries includes library users; special populations (illiterate, disadvantaged, limited English speaking, elderly, and handicapped); community information referral centers; and major urban resources libraries. Interlibrary cooperation is reported in Section IV under the headings of resource sharing, automation, and networks, and Section V presents the long-term plan. Goals and activities of the plan are presented under three headings: Title I, Public Library Services; Title II, Public Library Construction; and Title III, Interlibrary Cooperation and Resource Sharing.

In addition, in almost all cases, a consortium proposal has a superior chance to receive funding in a competitive situation. Drawing from the past experiences of WVMCCD, this  paper offers guidelines for other colleges interested in becoming consortium partners. The sections of the paper cover: (1) the advantages of consortia arrangements in the development and implementation of programs; (2) strategies for organizing consortium arrangements; (3) sources of funding for consortium projects; (4) examples of successful consortium projects; (5) suggestions for consortium organizers; and (6) concluding tips to help consortium partners keep their pooled efforts on track. Appendixes (the bulk of the document) include the memorandum of agreement for GAIN (Greater Avenues to Independence) Consortium, the Intel Corporation/Mission College Cooperative employer-based training project application, an example of a contract education program, and an articulation arrangement.

        "description":"The College of Marin has adopted a model of collegial governance that involves the entire campus community in recommending policies and procedures that determine the rules by which employees and students live. The model, which was designed by a task force representing faculty, staff, and students, is based on the U.S. Government model of executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Its major components are an Academic Senate, a Classified Senate, a Student Senate, and a Senate Executive Board. Each of the three Senates has two major roles: (1) to review and recommend District policies and College procedures; and (2) to recommend appointments from its membership to College governance committees. The Senate Executive Board is composed of an equal number of representatives from  each of the three Senates. Proposals for new or changed policies or procedures travel through a number of committees before reaching the Senate Executive Board (comparable to a legislative conference committee), where the proposals are refined using suggestions from the three individual Senates. The Board of Trustees has the final authority to veto or amend policies recommended to it by the Superintendent/President, who serves as the chair of the Senate Executive Board. The Superintendent/President has the authority to change recommended procedures if she or he feels they are not in the college's best interests. Through the collegial governance system, the College of Marin has established committees; these include the Affirmative Action Committee, Employee Development Committee, Planning  Committee, and Instructional Equipment Committee. Since the model's implementation, 42 policies and procedures have been recommended and approved. (WJT)",

After completing its initial review, the committee concluded that, while there was a general appreciation within the college community for the current liberal arts core, a sufficient integration of the various components was lacking. A proposal was drafted to redesign the curriculum to provide students with: (1) a sound command of college-level liberal arts skills; (2) a breadth of exposure to the various liberal arts disciplines through a liberal arts distribution component; and (3) a capstone experience provided through one of 11 new interdisciplinary core courses. The curriculum proposal and a 2-year plan for implementation met with  administrative and faculty approval. While the first two components of the core curriculum required only minor adjustments in existing programs, the development of the new interdisciplinary core courses involved the solicitation of faculty-generated course proposals, the provision of summer stipends or release time to faculty for course development, and the opportunity for faculty to enroll in graduate courses or attend conferences or workshops. Implementation also included faculty development workshops and guest lectures to prepare instructors to teach the new courses and the building of a supportive library of instructional materials. Student evaluations and faculty self-evaluations conducted for the first time in spring 1987 were highly favorable. Appendixes include course  descriptions, conference programs, conference and student evaluation forms, and course outlines. (JMC)",

The study examined the length of exposure to college effects, as measured by total semester credit hours (SCH) earned, and student satisfaction with NIACC as determined through a mailed survey. Study findings, based on a 61.24% response rate, included the following: (1) a significant relationship existed between SCH earned at NIACC and the level of transfer student satisfaction with NIACC preparation for the workplace; (2) no significant difference or relationship was observed between SCH earned  at NIACC and grade point average at graduation from a four-year institution; (3) no difference was observed between SCH and student satisfaction with the extent to which NIACC had prepared them as individuals, citizens, or family members; (4) the number of SCH earned at NIACC had little or no influence to student outcomes. However, the data did prove that the length of community college attendance was not negatively related to selected student outcomes. Appendixes state the purposes and hypotheses of the study, list general education goals, report findings from previous studies on community college effects, present the demographic characteristics of NIACC students, and offer a summary and conclusions.

The study also sought to compare nursing test scores of first-year nursing students who participated in the seminar with those who did not. The sample consisted of 30 first-year nursing students enrolled at a Southern California community college. Experimental and control groups were randomly drawn. A Test Anxiety Inventory (TAI) was administered to the control and experimental groups prior to and after taking the 3-hour seminar on test-taking strategies. Each nursing student completed two nursing tests prior to the first TAI and two nursing tests after the second TAI. The scores were analyzed and compared for both the  experimental and control groups. The experimental group, only, attended a test-taking strategy seminar 1 week after completing the first TAI; the second TAI was administered to both groups 1 week after the seminar. The study found that the nursing students who participated in the test-taking seminar had significantly lower test anxiety levels and significantly higher nursing test scores than those who did not participate. (The mean nursing test score prior to the semester was 81.20 for the experimental group and 80.13 for the control group, indicating a similar sample population.) A 36-item bibliography, the Test-Anxiety Instrument and the test-taking strategies covered at the seminar are appended. (WJT)",

        "description":"Findings and recommendations are presented from a three-year evaluation of the Transfer Center Pilot Program (TCPP), which was implemented in 20 California community colleges and universities to increase community college transfer rates among Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans, and low-income and disabled students. Transfer centers were established on community college campuses to identify, encourage, and assist potential transfer students, strengthen curricular coordination, and work with existing programs. Three models of service delivery were used: a group approach, an individual approach, and a mixed approach. Volume 1 presents an overview of evaluation results and recommendations pertaining to program continuation, expansion, and improvement. Major findings are highlighted,  including that supportive administrative environments aided effective Transfer Center implementation, that individual and mixed approaches were most successful in identifying and serving students, that a campus-wide focus on transfer and faculty involvement in the program helped the centers meet their goals, and that counseling improvements and more work to help less motivated students were needed. Volume 2 begins with an introduction to the TCPP, a profile of transfer center campuses, and an overview of the evaluation methodology. Subsequent chapters focus on: (1) implementation of TCPP at community colleges and four-year institutions, and intersegmental cooperation; (2) a descriptive profile of transfer students, comparing students from colleges with state-funded transfer centers  (SFTC's) and those from other colleges, and comparing students who were and were not transfer center students; (3) an assessment of the effectiveness of the TCPP in terms of transfer rates to University of California (UC) and California State University (CSU) campuses; and (4) a summary and conclusions regarding program implementation and program effectiveness. The appendixes include the evaluation topics covered during fieldwork interviews, the student questionnaire, and transfer data for 1982-83 through 1987-88, and statistical data and methods. (WJT)",

        "description":"This first-year report of the National Effective Transfer Consortium (NETC) summarizes the progress made by the member colleges in creating standardized measures of actual and expected transfer rates and of transfer effectiveness, and establishing a database that would enable valid comparisons among NETC colleges. Following background information on the NETC, the report proposes a new definition of transfer rate (i.e., the number of transfers divided by the number of non-reenrolling students), arguing that this definition more specifically identifies the number of students who could reasonably transfer rather than the number of students out of the entire student body who transferred. The second section explores various factors that help determine a range of expected transfer  rates for an individual college, including the local business environment, federal policies, college mission, academic program, and student demographics, and student services. Drawing from the NETC database, this section suggests that colleges with a high percentage of full-time students tend to have higher transfer rates than colleges with a low percentage of full-time students. The third section proposes a method for measuring transfer effectiveness that does not penalize colleges with large vocational/technological programs and, frequently, a large pool of students who neither want to transfer nor do so. The proposed model defines transfer effectiveness as the number of students who transfer compared to the number of students that are expected to transfer. Arguing that transfer  effectiveness depends on a college's organizational environment and its successful implementation of specific transfer-related strategies, the report concludes with a college self-assessment guide.

The primary change consisted of the teacher participating in all classroom and take-home writing assignments. In addition, texts by authors such as Ovid, Shakespeare, and Kafka were used in place of contemporary poems and short stories. Writing assignments consisted of in-class freewriting, rewriting stories, comparison papers, and a research paper. The teacher participated in all activities and provided samples to help students. Freewriting exercises by both the teacher and students were read aloud, and students were encouraged to share with the class any ideas or questions  that arose. The retelling of stories was used to encourage creativity as well as provide a subject for comparison papers. Students received their teacher's models first and then wrote their own retelling of a story with the teacher's model to be used as a writing aid. Research papers were also assigned, where students received a sample paper and then found their own topic, sought out the answer, and integrated their research into an essay. Few students seemed to have difficulties with documentation, and most students attempted to incorporate different styles of writing in their papers. At the end of the course, students expressed overall enthusiasm toward the paper examples provided by the teacher, saying that the papers guided and motivated them. (WJT)",

In fall 1989, 16,267 overrides were granted based on completion of equivalent coursework, instructor evaluations, life experience, previous degrees, and other reasons. A study was conducted to compare the academic success of students who had completed all course and basic skills prerequisites with that of students who had enrolled on override status. Study findings included the following: (1) 67% of the  students who had completed all course and basic skills prerequisites (N=32,248) received an A, B, C, or CR grade, compared to 59% of those who entered on override status; (2) 66% of those granted overrides on the basis of instructor evaluation received a C grade or higher, as did 65% of those with previous degrees, 65% of those with existing college transcripts, and 64% of those granted override based on life experience; (3) the greatest proportion of A and B grades were achieved by students with an override on the basis of previous degrees; (4) only 49% of the students who insisted upon taking a course above their assessment level received a C or better; and (5) overall, the counselors' successfully placed 57% of their students in spring 1988, 59% in fall 1988, 64% in spring 1989, and  59% in fall 1989.

        "description":"In 1989, a study was conducted at Saddleback College (SC) to analyze the success rates of students who delayed enrollment into a mathematics class after completing the assessment process. The study population consisted of 1,027 students who participated in the mathematics assessment process between July and August 1988 and who enrolled in at least one mathematics class during the period from fall 1988 through fall 1989. Students were considered successful if they completed the class with a grade of C or better. Study findings were as follows: (1) 68.7% of the students enrolled in a mathematics class with no delay; (2) 62% enrolled in the class recommended, 36% enrolled in a higher-level course, and approximately 2% enrolled in a course lower than that recommended; (3) of the  students enrolling in a math class one year after assessment, 41% enrolled in a more advanced class, and 14% enrolled in a lower course; (4) the success rate of students was fairly constant at approximately 42% over the four terms of the study; and (5) generally, overall success rates increased as the course level increased (from arithmetic through algebra). The data did not support the hypothesis that students who waited several terms to begin their mathematics study had a lower success rate in the recommended course than those who began their study immediately after assessment or only one semester later. Therefore, it was not recommended that SC students be required to retake the mathematics assessment test if they delayed enrollment in the mathematics curriculum. (JMC)",

The model links activities to specific measurable outcomes. Evaluation checks and feedback are built in at various levels so that program changes can be made without redesigning the whole program. The model consists of the following six steps: (1) define the purpose of the course or program; (2) identify three to six general activities which will achieve the defined purpose; (3) break down each activity to three to six more specific activities, making sure that the outcomes remain consistent; (4) continue to breakdown the activities to new levels of specificity until  all activities are clearly defined and understood; (5) identify all input and output at each level of activity; (6) determine relationships among the activities; and (7) identify constraints, such as attitudes, policies, and funding, which influence outcomes. The completed model should be checked to ensure that activities and outcomes are properly matched at each level and that all outcomes are clearly defined in measurable, behavioral terms.

Emphasis is placed on the role of community colleges and the institutional changes required to revitalize mid-career faculty. The problem of faculty vitality is examined in terms of the impending faculty shortage, symptoms of faculty burnout, measures of faculty vitality, and the specific nature of the problem of faculty vitality in the community college. Institutional causes of the problem are also examined with particular attention to the campus culture, the departmental climate, the influence of colleagues, faculty workload, changes in the student population, the tenure system, and the  reward structure. Finally, solutions to the problem are suggested in terms of successful practices for revitalization which have been used in business and in institutions of higher education. These practices include individualized growth plans, career planning, faculty exchanges, faculty internships, sabbaticals, job variety, faculty development programs, post-tenure evaluations, and incentives and rewards. A brief conclusion offers some specific suggestions for ways community colleges can enhance the professional growth and vitality of mid-career faculty. (JMC)",

        "description":"Drawing from interviews with 869 award-winning community college professors and instructors from the United States and Canada, this book describes the behaviors and techniques used by outstanding teachers in their roles as leaders, influencers, and motivators. Chapter 1 provides a foundation for the concept of teacher as leader, including operational definitions of \"teaching\" and \"learning\" and a discussion of motivation theories. Chapter 2 employs an analysis of leadership theory to demonstrate the clear link between leaders and followers, highlighting the path-goal model of leadership as the process of gathering behavioral information about teaching. Chapter 3 presents the research methodology used to describe effective teaching behavior, predict the behavior of effective  teachers, develop recommendations for improvement through self-evaluation, and explain ways in which effective teachers motivate students. Chapter 4 presents a profile of the award-winning instructors, including information on experience, age, gender, ethnicity, teaching fields, retention rates, and institutional policies. Chapter 5 provides a framework for employing the path-goal theory of leadership to explain the interaction between teaching and learning. Chapter 6 introduces the Teaching as Leading Inventory (TALI), a tool used to classify an instructor's dominant teaching style as Supporter, Theorist, Achiever, or Influencer. Chapters 7 through 10 offer detailed descriptions of each of these four teaching styles. After summarizing the four separate styles, chapter 11 reviews  leadership theories supporting situational teaching and a holistic and contingent view of teaching. Chapter 12 highlights current professional development programs in the U.S. and Canada. Finally, chapter 13 reviews the recommendations from three major educational reform reports as strategies for making teaching and learning a central aspect of all community colleges. Includes a compact version of the TALI and the survey instrument. (WBT)",

A sample of 98 nursing students who graduated between 1986 and 1988 was surveyed, with 93% responding to the pre-graduation survey and 68% responding after working in the field. The pre-graduation questionnaire asked students to assess how well the program achieved its stated goals and objectives for student preparation and to rate each semester of the program in terms of difficulty. Open-ended questions solicited opinions on the program's strengths and weaknesses. The post-graduation questionnaire consisted of questions on demographics; nursing  goals; perceptions of preparation to work as a beginning practitioner in pediatrics, obstetrics, psychiatry, medicine, and surgery; rating of tools, roles, and aspects of patient care management; and open-ended questions about program strengths and weaknesses. Questionnaire results identified only five areas for improvement: (1) fostering a desire to continue education in nursing throughout one's professional life; (2) fostering student-teacher collaboration in the learning process; (3) managing time effectively with regard to patient care; (4) meeting the demands of the average patient assignment; and (5) delegating tasks to auxiliary personnel. The main program strengths included nursing laboratory facilities and availability, professors' teaching skills, integration of classroom  content and laboratory activities with clinical practice, and individual development. Overall, nursing graduates considered their preparation to be good to excellent in certain areas of the program, both before and after graduation. (WJT)",

        "description":"This book for primary school teachers provides a practical collection of facts, advice, projects, games, stories, and sample questions for use in teaching children the importance of healthy habits. Food, personal hygiene, and the home environment are areas of particular concern. Details range from advice on ways to start a school garden or design a class growth chart to instructions for a game of &quot;germ warfare&quot; that illustrates how pathogens invade the human body. Throughout, the work emphasizes simple, imaginative tools for correcting errors of food safety, nutrition, and personal hygiene commonly found in developing countries. The book consists of seven self-contained teaching units which can be used in any sequence. Units deal with: (1) food and the body; (2) keeping food  safe; (3) a safe water supply; (4) safe collection and disposal of waste; (5) personal hygiene; (6) the role of insects, pests, and domestic animals in spreading disease; and (7) a healthy home environment. Teachers are given guidance for explaining to children the body's need for water, the types of food the body needs to stay healthy, and the means by which disease can be spread through a community. The liberally illustrated book contains numerous suggestions for involving children in practical activities that will reinforce what they learn and help them appreciate the relevance of their new knowledge to their lives outside the school.

In 1987-88, the ITCP program, which has a dual focus of supplying early childhood and secondary education, provided 526 teenage parents at 20 public high schools with comprehensive services designed to help them complete high school. Data on the early childhood and secondary education services was collected through interviews with a sample of 64 student participants, and surveys and interviews of staff. Emphasis was given to ascertaining the staff's education and related work experience; staff perceptions of program strengths and weaknesses; student attitudes toward the program, and student perceptions of program  benefits, strengths, and weaknesses. Findings indicated that student and staff perceptions of ITCP goals coincided to a great degree. Interview data showed that over half the students felt that participating in the program gave them a greater sense of the realities of parenting. Many students said their grades had improved since they entered the program. More than 90 percent of the staff rated the program as moderately to highly successful in improving student progress and providing child care services. The program was less successful in improving student parenting skills and preparing students for life after high school. A list of recommended readings is appended. (RH)",

Infant and toddler care is one of the four program components. The ITCP provides both early childhood and secondary education and is administered for the New York City Board of Education by the Office of Alternative High Schools and Special Programs. Field supervisors provide early childhood education administrative services, while on-site administrators provide secondary education administrative services. Objectives of the evaluation were to determine the roles and types of on-site supervision at ITCP sites, the nature of field supervision of program staff, and the nature  and sufficiency of the program's central staff. During spring and summer, 1988, survey and interview data were collected from program staff and administrators. All program staff were sent surveys, and interview data were collected from a representative staff sample. In addition, all central administrators, project coordinators, and six site supervisors were individually interviewed. Findings indicated that early childhood education paraprofessionals received the least communication and training. Recommendations for program improvement are offered. (RH)",

Reggio Emilia's municipal early childhood program incorporates high quality day care with a carefully articulated philosophy of education. The curriculum of the preschools is based on a project approach to learning that emphasizes symbolic representation. Children and teachers are viewed as partners in learning. Teachers serve as facilitators of a constructivist curriculum: as provocateurs who create discontinuous or discrepant experiences and problems. Teachers also serve as careful observers who document children's growth. Teachers view art as central to the educational process, as a form of exploration and expression. Each  preschool has an art teacher who is available to work with the children and their teachers throughout the day. Projects, which provide numerous opportunities for symbolic representation, may last for several days or months. A sequence of responding, recording, playing, exploring, hypothesis building and testing, and provoking occurs in most projects. The projects described in detail concern shadows, self-portraits, war play, enemies, and outer space. (RH)",

The measure developed was a 27-item Checklist for Rating Developmentally Appropriate Practice in Kindergarten Classrooms. The measure, composed of two scales, the Teachers' Beliefs Scale and the Instructional Activities Scale, was administered to 113 kindergarten teachers from 4 Southern states. Findings suggested that psychometric properties of the measure were encouraging; they revealed positive correlations between  developmentally appropriate beliefs and activities and between developmentally inappropriate beliefs and activities. Factors of both scales were fairly strong and independent. Teachers characterized as more developmentally appropriate felt themselves to be more in control than did teachers characterized as less developmentally appropriate. It is concluded that the teacher questionnaire shows promise of being a useful instrument for the study of teachers' perceptions of their beliefs and practices. Results support the contention that a great deal of inappropriate practice occurs in kindergarten classrooms. (Author/RH)",

The evaluation was designed to help New York policymakers assess the effectiveness of this approach to improving child care staff recruitment and retention and to assess its strengths and weaknesses as a model. After a brief introduction, contents focus on background and related work, methodology, problems relating to recruitment and retention of staff before the salary legislation, funding recipients, funding use, program impact on recruitment and retention, program impact on low-income child care, and plans for sustaining the gains of the salary legislation. Evaluation findings suggest  that early results of the legislation are promising. In New York City's subsidized day care centers, the only centers which had funding for a full year, turnover rates for classroom and supervisory personnel fell considerably. The allocation of funding across the state was accomplished equitably in accordance with the goals of the legislation. Conclusions are drawn and recommendations offered.

Topics include: (1)  community attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions; (2) parental self-image; (3) language stimulation; (4) emotional responsiveness of caregivers; (5) opportunities for exploratory play and appropriate play materials; and (6) behavioral restrictions and types of discipline. Strengths in the children's environments are listed. Chapter Three outlines theoretical frameworks for research. Chapter Four offers conclusions and discusses implications for research and programs. Three appendices provide research outlines, a program design outline, and a list of participants. (RH)",

        "description":"Considering that the field of American early childhood education and care is at the brink of a major shift in how it views its mission, this paper provides policymakers with ways to help understand the emergent situation, to define excellence in early education and care, and to plan a strategy to improve provision of services. A glance toward the past indicates dimensions of the changing climate in the field, focusing on the history of fragmentation among programs with limited scope, antecedents of the perceptual shift regarding the field, and, briefly, the need for broad agreement on how to reorganize the delivery system. A first step toward developing a preliminary concensus proposes three elements of a definition of excellence in early education and care: (1) the production of  high quality programming that takes into account research findings on and between behavioral and environmental variables; (2) the clarification of equality in the context of early childhood programs; and (3) the development of an integrated system to obtain efficiencies of operation and economies of scale. A second step, from fragmented delivery systems toward a system providing comprehensive, improved services, offers three strategies for change. Strategies contrast thinking in terms of a program model, particulars, and the short-term, with planning more systemically, universally, and for the long haul. Fifty-seven references are cited.

        "description":"According to U.S. Census data, in rural Pennsylvania, 37% of adults did not complete higher school, and 21% did not go beyond 8th grade. As a consequence of present demographic and literacy trends, the proportion of the workforce with low levels of basic skills is growing. At the same time, a changing labor market is creating new jobs that demand higher skills and job performance from entry-level employees than in the past. Inadequate workforce literacy is expected to be a costly drain on businesses and industries in the future. A variety of federally legislated programs focus on the literacy problem. In addition, a state program funded by the Pennsylvania Adult Literacy Act of 1986 is aimed at adults with a 5th grade reading level or less. However, 25 of Pennsylvania's 41  nonmetropolitan counties offer no literacy programs under this act, perhaps due to a priority to serve minorities. The act also seems to favor funding to urban areas with their greater numbers of undereducated adults, while neglecting the greater proportion of undereducated adults in rural areas. Designers of literacy programs for rural areas must take into account the unique features and inherent disadvantages of rural areas: geographic isolation, lower population density, social and demographic composition, lack of organizations to provide programs, low self-esteem and motivation, the need to use existing rural networks to recruit students, and the need to incorporate distance education technologies.

        "description":"Summer camp is a type of laboratory for community living. Society's needs have changed from providing a positive summer challenge for idle youth to experimenting with the demands and rewards of working in community groups. Decentralized camping emphasizes the team decision-making approach to teach self-reliance and awareness of democratic responsibilities. Using the dynamics of group theory in staff training and in the supervision of the summer camping experience enhances teambuilding. Based on transactional analysis theory, camp groups move through four stages as they gain independence and assume responsibilities: child, adolescent, adult, and parent. Initially, leadership in the camp group is provided by the counselor but as the group matures, leadership evolves from within.  The counselor's role in the maturing group is that of a guide, leading by example, using creative feedback to help campers learn from their actions, and serving as a moderator and facilitator. Several steps are proposed to ensure that campers develop positive attitudes about themselves and their future community roles: (1) structuring decision-making experiences; (2) sharing leadership activities; (3) dealing openly with issues; (4) participating with the group; (5) emphasizing the importance of all group members; (6) creating activity schedules that allow a variety of children to excel; (7) structuring team-building exercises; (8) integrating cliques into the group; (9) approaching problem solving democratically; (10) emphasizing attempt versus outcome; and (11) interpreting the process  and the task involved in activities.

        "description":"Adventure programs attempt to control or limit injuries in high-risk programming. This risk management has concentrated on the physical safety of participants at the expense of emotional and developmental security. In the zeal for accident-free statistics, a highly controlled, directive approach is created that treats individuals according to a presubscribed plan of objectives, rather than as the unique combinations of experiences, fears, skills, and needs that they really are. A two-fold need exists, one for consistency and uniformity to control accidents and the other for individual adaptation and diversity to ensure success. Two of the most important elements in risk management are a positive attitude and an understanding of the real risks to participants involved in the  activity. These elements are accommodated by following a sequential learning pattern in which basic skills are mastered before allowing individuals to get in over their heads. Rules are carefully explained and the real dangers isolated to place the responsibility for safety ultimately in the hands of the participants. While most programs have developed a curriculum based on this cumulative approach to physical safety, this strategy has not been applied to the management of psychological risk. Programs must foster development of the same two processes in psychological risk management as those developed in physical risk management, that is, to create a positive attitude towards risk-taking, and to provide a competency-based, sequential approach to the amount of emotional and psychological  risk required in each activity.

        "description":"Migrant students on the secondary level comprise an ethnically diverse population with many educational needs. Migrant Education programs assist students in overcoming problems that result from language barriers, cultural differences, school interruptions, credit deficiencies, educational tracking, and grade retention in order to ensure high school graduation and the pursuit of postsecondary education. Despite the obstacles facing migrant youth, their resilience and determination--in combination with the intervention of Migrant Education--have enabled greater numbers of migrant students to graduate from high school in recent years. At the 1988 meeting of Migrant Education Secondary Assistance (MESA), migrant educators listed positive characteristics of various migrant ethnic  groups: extended family support, family unit support, a strong work ethic, group cooperation, religious and ethnic identity, respect for authority, strong life and survival skills, and a valuing of education. A general list of strengths that individual migrant students may possess includes maturity, responsibility, optimism, self-advocacy, resiliency, resourcefulness, cooperation, endurance, and a sense of humor. The focus on positive characteristics was described as an asset model, which has these advantages: (1) builds self-esteem; (2) builds on student's success, and improves motivation; (3) raises students' expectations; and (4) shifts the focus of need for change from the student to the institution. Specific recommendations and various topical concerns presented in this paper address  staff training, school improvements, Migrant Education program service, and direct services for students.

Migrant Education's success has encouraged recent changes in funding to extend services to those youths between 17 and 21 who have not graduated. Attempts to draw dropout youths back to regular or alternative schools must take into account the reasons the students had for dropping out. Three leading indicators of students at high risk of dropping out are: (1) they are old for their age group; (2) they show poor academic achievement; and (3) they have low socio-economic status. Economic and cultural pressures not only increase the students' chances for leaving early, but also increase the difficulties of luring them back. This report presents  summaries of interviews of 13 experienced migrant educators conducted by staff of the Migrant Education Secondary Assistance (MESA) project. The educators presented ideas for administrative and educational practices that could be effective in increasing the number of dropouts returning to educational programs, including: (1) the work study concept; (2) flexible scheduling; (3) the dropout prevention specialist or advisor role; (4) community involvement; (5) role models; (6) parent involvement; and (7) a pre-General Educational Development Test (GED) program.

Bailey, found school financing in West Virginia to be inequitable and prescribed quality standards for every aspect of public education. This report examines teachers' responses to resulting school reform efforts. In-depth interviews were conducted with over 200 selected teachers and administrators at five West Virginia sites, and relevant national and state documents were analyzed. Recurrent themes were that teachers: (1) knew little about reform efforts in their county and state, and saw little change in their classrooms; (2) viewed reform as an ineffective &quot;paper exercise&quot;; (3) were angry over low salaries, failing benefits, and excessive paperwork; and (4) felt that they have little control of decision-making in their schools.  Elementary teachers have felt the brunt of reform, with the imposition of time requirements on the instructional day, while secondary teachers have been relatively untouched in their classroom practices. Teacher responses fit various profiles, including accommodative, resistant, and self-protective. These themes and profiles support the conclusion that West Virginia teachers are disconnected from and disenfranchised within their schools. Since teachers are the element most crucial to quality education, their exclusion from decision-making in the reform process will certainly impede the achievement of reform goals. This report contains 125 references, a list of West Virginia reform activities since 1982, excerpts from West Virginia State Board of Education policy, and an overview of U.S.  school reform and the unique needs of rural schools.

To attain this goal, schools often must compensate for the disadvantaged backgrounds of some students who have needs that cannot be fully met by the regular instructional program. Compensatory programs represent a way to assist these students. This two-part report views Chapter 1 and migrant program activities in North Carolina during 1987-88. The review of Chapter 1 programs examines program administration, participants served, instruction delivered, staff employed, funds expended, and outcomes measured. In 1987-88, North Carolina Chapter 1 allocations totaled $72.4 million. Seventy-five percent of schools were eligible to receive Chapter 1  funds, based upon poverty indices, and 92% of eligible schools provided services. Most services were provided to students in grades 4-8. At least 75% of the Chapter 1 instruction occurred in a location other than the regular class. These &quot;pullout activities&quot; were successful as measured by students' scores. Reading was the most prevalent instructional activity. Program costs were reasonable. Review of migrant programs suggests that this North Carolina migrant education program is adequately meeting the legislative requirements and the national program objectives. Recommendations generally encourage continuing current successful migrant education programs. This document contains numerous tables and figures. (Author/DHP)",

Hispanic elderly are a rapidly growing proportion of the total Hispanic population, and are also among the most economically, physically, and emotionally vulnerable populations. This paper describes a recruitment program to identify Hispanic college students interested in pursuing a career of service to Hispanic elderly. Four partnerships were established with universities located in regions with high concentrations of Hispanic elderly. The paper describes the 10-week summer internship, a major component of the year-long training program. Students were placed with selected national agencies located in Washington, D.C.,  such as the U.S. Congress House Select Committee on Aging or the National Hispanic Council on Aging. Goals of the summer internship were to increase students' general knowledge of and interest in gerontology careers. Student interns provided auxiliary staff personnel for selected agencies, increased agencies' awareness of Hispanic elderly needs, and offered opportunities for agencies to interact with each other. The paper describes orientation, placement activities, seminars, student program evaluations, and program implementation. There was consensus among participants and supervisors that such a program should be continued. (DHP)",

        "author":["Howley, Craig B."],
        "description":"While most economists agree that educational attainment contributes to national economic performance, studies have not generally confirmed a similar conclusion with respect to rural areas. This paper examines the relationships between rural education and economics. The new aim of American education, restoration of national economic competitiveness, is based on human capital theory and promotes the instrumental view that wise investments in this resource will strengthen the economy. Available evidence, however, suggests that rural schools are expected to carry out this mission with meager financial support. Increased efficiency is hardly possible in a system already operating very efficiently. The paper explores a number of analyses of rural economics and the causes and conditions  of rural poverty. It proposes that the macroeconomy requires the marginality of rural enterprises. The paper demonstrates that human capital theory cannot explain the economic plight of rural areas, vocationalism has not provided the promised economic development, and the technology of school improvement is problematic for rural schools. Two contemporary proposals are considered: entrepreneurship as the new vocationalism and the nurture of minds that construct meaning. The latter views rural education as a cultural act, preserving and extending culture, against education as an economic end. This paper contains 109 references. (DHP)",

        "description":"In rural Minnesota many school districts are limited in their efforts to restructure by low enrollment, rural geographic location, meager tax base, narrow staff experience, extensive job responsibilities for staff, restricted staff development opportunities, and lack of direction in curriculum coordination. Because of actual or perceived limitations, learning opportunities are restricted and may not prepare students for what they will need to do after they graduate. This preliminary report discusses education districts, a relatively new organizational concept. The 1987 legislation that enabled their formation requires an education district to have one of the following: at least five districts, or four districts with a total of at least 5,000 students, or four districts with a  total of at least 2,000 square miles. As of November, 1989, 33 education districts had been formed in Minnesota. Education districts are to: (1) provide leadership in coordinating programs for handicapped, secondary vocational education, gifted and talented pupils, improved learning, community education, early childhood and family education, career education, and low incidence academic programs; (2) provide and coordinate research and planning functions; and (3) coordinate and provide methods to meet pupils needs for health, library, and counseling services. Educators must work toward merging services into a collaborative network to provide access for all residents to meet basic human needs. (DHP)",

        "description":"Statistics courses are often viewed by many college students as impediments to the attainment of a desired degree. It is not uncommon for students to delay taking required statistics courses until just before graduation. Often part of the reason for this is a transferral of a basic anxiety about mathematics to statistics. The objectives of this study were to examine the relationship between student attitudes, self-concept, mathematics background, and academic performance in a statistics course. The sample used in this study was 68 students in a masters degree program in a school of education; 93 percent of the students were female. Methods, instruments used, and procedures are discussed. Results indicated that course performance was not related to attitudes toward statistics,  mathematics self-concept mathematics background or attitudes toward tests. Most of the students attributed their success in the course to their instructor. (CW)",

        "description":"Several studies of mathematics education have singled out the early and rigid ability grouping as one of the principal reasons for mathematics underachievement in the United States. Public schools in the United States engage in extensive sorting of students into sharply differentiated curricula by the end of sixth or seventh grade. This study examines the ways in which students' assignment to ability groups in middle and secondary school mathematics are influenced by the organizational features and placement policies of the schools themselves. Specifically, this research examines the fast track in mathematics which includes only 16 to 17 percent of U.S. students and is critical for qualification for college mathematics and physical science programs. The views of college  admissions officers, variations by district in accelerated mathematics courses, explanations for variations in enrollment patterns, organizational factors influencing group assignment, and several case studies are discussed. Findings indicate that there are substantial variations in ability grouping that lead to inequities and arbitrary elements in student placement and that the range of abilities found in higher level tracks among different school systems can be explained by individual characteristics, and attitudes among school administrators. Implications for women and minorities are suggested. A list of 67 references is included. (CW)",

The results of the study showed that the children in both samples constructed similar initial concepts about the Earth and went through similar steps in the process of changing these concepts to make them conform to the currently accepted scientific notions. Both the Greek and U.S. children conceptualized the earth as flat and stationary and thought it was located in the middle of the solar system. They also thought that things fall down, not toward the center of the spherical earth, and that the  day/night cycle is caused by the movement of the sun and the moon.

In this study, conceptual shifts were proposed as means of examining the process of conceptual change. The relationship of reasoning level, science process skills, gender, and instructional treatment to conceptual shifts in grade 10 biology students were compared. Student reasoning levels were evaluated using the Test of Logical Thinking (TOLT). The Test of Integrated Process Skills (TIPS) was used to measure the students' proficiency with science process skills.  Five concept evaluation statements were used to determine the students' understandings of the concepts of diffusion, the cell, circulation, plant food production, and genetics. All instruments were used in a pretest/posttest format. Results indicated that instructional treatment was the only factor that significantly influenced positive shifts in student understanding of a concept. Gender was found to have a moderate influence in an honors class. Reasoning level and prior knowledge did not correlate positively with shifts in student understanding. (Author/CW)",

Results indicated that: (1) the belief structures of elementary teachers were more simplistic than those of secondary teachers; (2) there was no typical pre-service teacher belief structure; (3) pre-service teachers already possessed some knowledge about teaching and had an organized belief structure regarding teaching when they entered the methods instruction; and (4) the primary area of concern for most teachers centered around students and the second most dominant area of concern centered around the task of teaching.

        "description":"The purposes of this study were to determine (1) whether or not the participants of the program demonstrated significant gains in knowledge and attitudes as a result of the courses; (2) whether the gains persisted over time; and (3) if there was an associated increase in the participants' proclivity to do science which was also stable over time. Four instruments were used in this study. The PIES test was a 50 item, multiple choice instrument measuring knowledge and comprehension of basic science content and process. The second instrument used was the Science Attitude Scale for Inservice Elementary Teachers, a 26 item instrument. The third instrument, the Science Proclivity Test, was a 25 item instrument designed to assess teachers' inclination to do activity-oriented science  lessons. The PIES Evaluation Project Knowledge Test was a 25 item, multiple choice instrument constructed from the first test. Significant gains were found in the PIES group of teachers compared to a control group and these gains appeared to be stable over the 5 years of the study. Appended are the Science Attitude Scale; the Science Proclivity Test; and the PIES Evaluation Project Knowledge Test. (CW)",

In order to understand U.S. society, citizens must know something about the development of the religious ideas, practices, and institutions found in the United States today. Ten topics are presented: (1) \"Why Go to the New World?\"; (2) \"Conformity or Diversity\"; (3) \"The American Revolution: A Religious War?\"; (4) \"Subsidy or Separation?\"; (5)\"The Churches on the American Frontier\"; (6) \"Black Americans and the Churches\"; (7) \"Religion: Personal and Social\"; (8) \"Ways of Understanding: Science and Religion\"; (9) \"Conscience or Constitution?\"; and (10) \"America: Protestant or Pluralist?\" Each  of these studies utilizes primary sources that treat a significant religious dimension of U.S. history. These readings are preceded by a short introduction to the topic under consideration and questions to help the reader focus on the major points and identify the central considerations.

The teaching strategy must promote genuine learning, taking every safeguard to prevent indoctrination. Only then is the public school teacher warranted, legally and morally, to undertake an in-depth examination of religious traditions. Each of the 10 studies presented in the text \"Pathways to Pluralism\" has an integrity of its own. While it is not necessary that these studies be used in a fixed sequence, it is important that any study chosen be used in its entirety in order to promote objectivity. Free inquiry and induction are characteristic of the materials. Students are asked to analyze source materials related to  religion and the social studies, and on the basis of the information provided, are asked to develop their own positions. Then an open, informed class discussion permits students to present their own points of view, and respectfully consider positions different from the ones they have reached. This teacher's guide includes for each study: (1) a statement of the primary goals; (2) information to be considered in responding to the study questions in the text; (3) oral and written activities that may be presented at the conclusion of the study; (4) questions for further research; and (5) a vocabulary list.

The recent events in Iran, the Iran-Iraq War and its aftermath, the maneuvering of a powerful post-war Iraq, increasing Soviet activism, and the proliferation of chemical weapons and ballistic missiles call for an examination of what political, economic, and military elements will best serve future U.S. policy and interests in the region. Few conference participants saw any prospects of a genuine peace in the region in the near future, and most agreed there was little threat of Soviet intervention. Participants agreed that a  fundamental reassessment of U.S. policy in the region was necessary. They identified several key issues but disagreed on potential outcomes. The major issues for U.S. policy consideration include: (1) the need to shift U.S. attention from deterring the Soviets toward a focus on forces in the Persian Gulf; (2) an exploration with the United Nations to diffuse the Shatt al-Arab River as a trigger for renewed conflict; (3) a reevaluation of U.S. military presence in the region based on the perception of a decreased Soviet threat; (4) an assessment of the opportunities for active U.S. diplomacy in the Gulf; (5) an examination of the potential for developing multilateral regimes for the purpose of promoting rapprochement among the Gulf states; and (6) a determination of what efforts can be  made to find a regime to limit both chemical and advanced conventional weapons proliferation. The report could be used as background information for teachers or by secondary level students. (JB)",

The resolution is meant to contribute to young people (1) becoming more aware of the European identity and the value of European civilization and of its foundations; (2) realizing the advantages of the European Community and the challenges they will encounter on gaining access to a larger economic and social territory; and (3) improving their knowledge about the historical, cultural, economic, and social aspects of the EC and its member states and realizing the significance of the cooperation among member states and other countries in Europe and the rest of the world. Since teachers play a key role in actual educational  innovation, teacher training colleges should be involved in plans for implementation of the European dimension in an early stage. The limits and possibilities of the individual teacher also should be taken into account. And finally, a national plan must be developed and carried out within the formal educational system. The action plan for implementation of this new policy in the Netherlands involves (1) the evaluation of teaching materials on the European dimension; (2) the development of a core curriculum; (3) the design of testing instruments, the revision of existing teaching material, or the development of new materials; (4) the involvement of teacher training colleges; (5) the development of small regional in-service training centers for teachers; (6) teachers' conferences for  information exchange; and (7) the contacts with educational publishers.

Within the scope of basic education, certain committees received a commission from the minister of education to pay explicit attention to environmental issues. The general aim is to integrate the insights and skills that are indispensable for making well-reasoned choices concerning man and the environment. For the period 1988-1992, a plan was launched that aimed to develop a core curriculum for environmental studies, the analysis of existing teaching materials, and regional refresher courses and implementation. An additional goal was to gear internal and external school  activities to one another in a more effective manner. The government provided the financial means for implementing these new policies. The implementation will be the task of a national network for environmental studies where curriculum development, research, in-service training, and the development of teaching materials will take place in mutual cooperation.

A number of successful community school partnerships are presented. The first section shows how the  business community is involved in LRE in Los Angeles, California, through one program called Business Issues in the Classroom and another called Youth Community Service. The next section looks at some cities where LRE teachers and the local media have worked together to help students develop a new appreciation of the media and its role in current events. Other organizations and groups one might want to involve in LRE are the American Lawyers Auxiliary, people and businesses in the sports world, commercial artists and publishers, public utility companies, and civic groups.

        "author":["Sheppard, Alice"],
        "description":"As a technique of social control intimately associated with the display and control of power, humor reflects empowerment. Contemporary women have few traditions of using power, and a variety of covert factors have discouraged women's use of humor. The most significant of these is the way that the popular mind has defined humor as a male prerogative. Humor can only be achieved through use of symbolic and linguistic codes. Society has not fully recognized how jealously men guard the use of these codes. Because women's participation in humor has been alternately impeded and underestimated, it is important for social scientists and feminists to try to understand the factors responsible. This is not easy, partly because attitudes and beliefs are so deeply held that one may fail to see  the very thing at which one is looking. An additional difficulty with humor is that its implicit symbolism enables meaning to coexist on multiple levels. Thus, it remains unclear to the critic whether a particular image or stereotype is being lampooned or upheld. And yet humor, perhaps more than other social measures, is a subtle indicator of the status of a subgroup. When the dominant group is ready to laugh at one's jokes, then one is a member of society.

Today, for many different reasons, members of minority groups are living in West Germany again. This paper presents the experience of minorities in West Germany since 1945 in light of the following factors: German history, living conditions, language skills, educational situation, political organizations, cultural activities and contributions, and the way minorities see themselves within the society. Minority-majority relations are especially considered as they constitute significant indicators for the political culture of West Germany or any other country. Four different minority groups are examined: Jews, Sinti and Roma (gypsies),  Danish, and labor immigrants. The increasing ethic and cultural diversity of West Germany, and, indeed, all of Europe, is already a fact, but its consequences will depend on the attitudes of the citizens and the public policies pursued. Major policy areas include: the legal status and political rights of minorities, the equality of opportunities in terms of equal access to public goods, and the promotion of minority cultural activities.

Returns numbered 924, a 20.5% rate of response (the teachers' rate was only 18.3%). Results of this study show \"Understanding Taxes\" to be a well-used supplement to the 11th- and 12th-grade curricula of many high schools around the nation. It is used primarily in economics classes, although  teachers of business, government, and social studies also have found it to be useful. Generally, reactions to \"Understanding Taxes\" are quite positive. In using the program, most teachers pick and choose from among the instructional pieces. Some relatively minor concerns about the video programs and computer software were reported. Appendices contain the three survey instruments used for the research. (AS)",

Teacher educators are keen on independence, but seem to hold different definitions of the concept, and these various definitions do not co-exist happily. The relative autonomy that one may be able to achieve is not to be had unless one acknowledges one's dependence. Without that acknowledgment, the independence that adults hurry toward and hurry their children toward, does not bring the adult solidity and security that were expected. Of course it is quite easy to get children to imitate and internalize the conventional models of independence, but this does not last because true autonomy requires that one have experienced and still be in touch with one's feelings of dependence.

        "description":"The elementary social studies curriculum should be restructured in a way that promotes a broader study of people, places, and events that are distant in space and time. The \"Expanding Horizons\" framework guides social studies curriculum in New Brunswick, as well as in many other Canadian provinces and the United States. It emphasizes moving from the known to the unknown, and begins with the child's own knowledge, experience, and interests. Because of the impact of technological and social changes during this century, this approach needs to be redefined. The present curriculum does not expand children's experiences, but instead leads to stagnation. Current curricula too often focus on the familiar and fail to promote a global perspective and prepare students for later grades.  Present curriculum disregards and stifles children's interest and imagination, rather than utilizing them in teaching. Although cognitive development theory sees formal historical understanding as impossible for most elementary school age children, there has been success in teaching history at this age in France, West Germany, Italy, and Great Britain. At the elementary levels, narrative, literary style instruction can be beneficial in social studies, since it more closely resembles history as children understand it. The use of literature and story telling can work toward the common goals of social studies education that are often limited by traditional textbook use. (AS)",

        "author":["Levin, Henry M."],
        "description":"One of the most significant educational reforms in Western Europe during the last two decades has been the attempt to create a system of comprehensive secondary schools. The traditional approach to secondary education was characterized by a highly stratified formal system in which students were allocated to academic, commercial, or vocational secondary schools on the basis of examinations taken at 10-12 years of age. The purpose of the comprehensive secondary school was to delay educational selection and stratification in order to provide more nearly equal educational opportunities and choices at the secondary level for children drawn from different social class origins. The dilemma of the reform is that the reduction in selection and stratification at the secondary level must  necessarily create a shift of these functions to the postsecondary educational system and labor markets. A number of changes have taken place in higher education in Western Europe that reflect this tendency. These include the increase in selective admissions policies, dilution of resources, increased class differentiation among types of institutions, rises in wastage or dropout rates, and the effects of surpluses of graduates in the labor market. All of these contribute to stratification in the higher educational population. (AS)",

These problems are associated with industrialization, lack of money to enforce anti-pollution practices, climatic and population pressures, and cultural factors. Half of India's forests have been cut in the last 40 years. Deforestation is the result of the need for wood for manufacturing and fuel, and the expansion of farmlands. India is prone to both drought and floods, and soil erosion also is a serious problem. Air pollution in both urban and rural areas, originating from fires, factories, and automobiles causes a high national incidence of respiratory and other diseases. Seventy percent of available water in India is badly polluted. Rivers and wells are contaminated by  human and industrial waste, causing widespread occurrence of water-related disease. Increased reduction of animal species is yet another environmental problem. The lack of resources to deal effectively with environmental problems and the influence of Indian cultural factors seriously hinder solving these problems. Necessary solutions will require substantial effort and resources. (AS)",

Use of such sources also helps the students develop important analytical skills, and gives them an opportunity to participate in the process of history. A collection of 52 articles, each highlighting a National Archives document and providing practical suggestions for classroom use, is presented in this book. The articles originally appeared in &quot;Social Education,&quot; a journal published by the National Council for the Social Studies. Essays are intended to aid teachers in the use of primary documents  to enhance their curriculum.

        "description":"A review of eight leading political science journals beginning with the first volume of the \"American Political Science Review\" in 1906 revealed no articles or statements about how elementary civic education is or should be taught. Several reasons for this omission are suggested. First, the elementary civic education curriculum was established before the American Political Science Association was founded and thus before its members could participate in designing civic education curricula. Second, after World War II political scientists began to emphasize strongly the \"scientific\" aspects of their inquiries as a result of the \"behavioral\" revolution. This excluded the possibility of supporting public or educational policies because as scientists they could not be policy advocates.  Political scientists chose not to push the implicit value commitments of their disciplinary findings onto public educators and into public school classrooms. This professional reluctance notwithstanding, four ideas to consider in designing elementary civic education curricula are presented. They are: (1) students should learn about important characteristics of liberal democracy and its historical development; (2) students should learn that the development of liberal democracy in the United States has been flawed and oppressive as well as liberating and enlightening; (3) students should draw upon political scientific knowledge in the consumption and production of texts about their social and political world; and (4) students should be taught that social and political life and practices are  complex, contradictory, and transitory.

This report presents the results of the 1988-1989 U.S. History End-of-Course Test. Four forms of the test were administered within each classroom. Each form consisted of a core test of 60 common items, and an additional 40 items. Core scores from this 1989 test were compared with the previous year's scores (the first year the U.S. History Test was given). Students scored an average of 70% correct on the core test, an increase from the first year. Males continued to score higher than females, and white students made slightly larger gains than other ethnic groups. Children of parents educated beyond high school scored  higher than others. There was some variance in scores by educational region. Average scores for school systems ranged from 32.8 to 46.7. Statewide, 73 students achieved a perfect score, and less than three percent missed no more than three test questions. Achievement across all goals appears to be consistent, indicating that teachers are covering all major periods of history and are not concentrating on a few areas at the expense of others. (AS)",

        "description":"Is the concept of \"quality of life\" potentially an important one for public policy analysis, or must it remain forever vague and controversial, resisting clear definition and scientific measurement? Everyday usage of the phrase is examined as well as its relation to other terms like \"happiness\" and \"welfare.\" It is concluded that one reason for introducing the phrase \"quality of life\" into discussion of public policy is to have something to replace the now unfashionable terms \"general happiness\" or \"social welfare.\" Various definitions of the phrase are examined, three objective and two subjective: (1) Quality of life i R is per capita gross regional income in R; (2) Quality of life in R is the degree to which people in R are provided with basic goods and services; (3) Quality of  life in R is proportional to the fraction of R's population for which the necessary conditions for happiness are provided; (4) Quality of life in R is the level of happiness reported by the residents of R; and (5) Quality of life in R is the degree to which the preferences of individuals in R are satisfied. Three conclusions are drawn: (1) the concept of quality of life is an evaluative concept that embodies some theory about the nature of the good and how people should live their lives; (2) different definitions of the phrase will be appropriate at different times, depending on the nature of the decision and of the affected community; and (3) although no set of social indicators can be definitive of quality of life, social indicators are essential to informed decision making. They also  serve to politicize decisions that are relevant to quality of life. (JB)",

A questionnaire was mailed to 1,296 current and 738 former members. This final report presents the findings of that survey. The demographic characteristics, religious and political beliefs and attitudes, and commitment to and participation in Bread for the World are analyzed for both current and former members. Few differences were found between the two groups in this area, although former members may be more politically conservative. Bivariate analyses were conducted of the characteristics of activists, of low income  and minority members, of changes in the characteristics of BFW members over time, and of why people do not renew their memberships. Activists were considerably more liberal than nonactivists and were less alienated from the political process than nonactivists. The total number of minority group members in the sample was too small to analyze. Low income members were strikingly similar to the remainder of BFW members in every way except income. There were only slight differences between earlier and more recent members. There were no sizable and consistent differences between people giving different reasons for not renewing their memberships.

Focusing on the complexity of the teaching situation, a discussion is presented on the importance of mastering methods and models of teaching. Three basic dimensions of the action-situation relationships facing the teacher in the multidimensional, immediate, and unpredictable classroom are considered: (1) a goal state or end product to be achieved, (2) a problem space or set of conditions and resources available to research the goal state, and (3) the operations involved in assembling and using available resources. It is pointed out that teachers must organize groups of  students, establish rules and procedures, elicit students' cooperation in classroom activities, and sustain order for designated blocks of time across several months. Instructional methods offer a way to bring some order to this complex situation. (JD)",

The experience, coupled with activities and readings in the university classroom, is designed to make students reconsider a variety of issues--what it means to learn something, the intellectual capabilities of children, the role of the teacher, and students' own knowledge. To achieve these ends, students wrestle with a seemingly simple piece of mathematics; they then see a class of third graders discussing the same mathematics. The students interview the teacher of the class about her purposes, her knowledge of both mathematics and learners, and her approach to teaching. They then interview a third grader, discussing their own understanding of mathematics and their  feelings about the class. Finally, they attempt to teach the mathematics to someone. Excerpts are included from students' papers and from their final examination in which they had to compare two teachers' approaches to teaching operations with negative numbers. (Author/JD)",

        "description":"In the study reported here, it is argued that recent policies implemented to improve the quality of the teaching profession by altering career structures are not likely to affect positively teachers' practices, teachers' work conditions, students' learning, or traditional school organizational patterns. Analyses of four teacher career structures indicate that current occupational structures do little to address such issues as how teachers teach; what teachers know; and the diversity in terms of knowledge, skill, ambitions, and interests among individuals in the profession. Three alternatives for career structures are proposed--teachers as participants in a school community, teachers as participants in the local community, and teachers as individuals. The three alternative  structures are discussed and evaluated in terms of how they account for individual differences among teachers while maintaining high standards for meaningful teaching and learning, and how they take into account existing organizational characteristics, norms, and expectations of teaching life.

        "description":"A mathematics methods course is a critical site for intervening on prospective teachers' past experiences with mathematics, which have often left them without a meaningful understanding of mathematical content, appreciation of what mathematics entails, or confidence in their own ability to do and to learn mathematics. This paper examines the role of a preservice mathematics methods course in helping beginning elementary teacher candidates re-examine and move beyond these past experiences in order to help them learn to teach mathematics for understanding. The paper combines a conceptual analysis of the role of past experiences in learning to teach mathematics with a description of new experiences that were specifically designed to intervene on the past experiences. The new  experiences lead the student teachers to reconstruct their prior experiences and to redirect the course of their future with the subject, in this case, mathematics. The conceptual analysis is elaborated with discussion of the prospective teachers' reactions. (Author/JD)",

The example of the teacher education program at the University of Dayton (Ohio) is cited, with emphasis on the junior year component--the BLOCK program. The BLOCK program, which includes all methods courses required of elementary majors, emphasizes depth and encourages faculty to engage in joint planning and advising with students. BLOCK students learn to evaluate different rule systems, ask critical questions, and derive principles of good teaching.  The program utilizes the prescription-principle approach which enables faculty to identify what is important and ensures that students know certain requisite material. Students are challenged to question the limits and exceptions to what they know. An outline of the entire elementary curriculum (professional studies component) is provided in the appendix. (JD)",

A survey of states with less than 10 percent minorities revealed that many teachers who find employment in states with high population densities and large numbers of minorities were trained in states with low population densities and few minorities. For example, many teachers from states with few minorities, such as New Hampshire, Idaho, and Maine, find employment in states such as Florida, Texas, California, and New York which have high minority populations. It was also discovered that states with few minorities are more inclined than states with large minority populations to require multicultural credentials for certification. Efforts to enhance  multicultural skills among teachers are desultory, lacking in pattern and leadership. However, evidence implies that institutional and discipline based initiatives are developing in the wake of growing numbers of culturally diverse students. (JD)",

Assessments occurred at the beginning of the school year, in October, and near the end of the school year, in May. A 1989 study using primary grades children as assessors of teaching performance had revealed that students did not differentiate between the performance of novice interns and that of master teachers. This study, using students from primary age to the age of 13, confirmed the results of the previous study. The final results revealed that primary, intermediate, and middle level students consistently rated all of their teachers, master and novice, significantly lower at  the end of the year than they had rated them at the beginning of the year. The results were directly opposed to the data obtained from expert and self-assessment studies. While the students discriminated between the competency of interns and master teachers toward the end of the school year, they were also more severe in their judgments of teaching performance toward the end of the year. This report analyses these findings and raises questions for future research. (JD)",

        "description":"This paper aims to accomplish several purposes through conceptual analysis, story telling and interpretation, excursions into philosophy, and recent studies of teachers' professional development. First, the paper identifies limitations and confusions in current conceptions of teachers' professional thinking: equating teacher thinking with planning and decision making, and confounding professional choice with personal liberty. These limitations and confusions mislead thought and action in efforts at teacher development and school improvement. Second, in a counterargument, the paper stresses the limits of choice in teaching (as in any social role) and introduces a membership-goodness-obligation theme. The counterargument and theme lead to a broadened conception of teacher thinking  that includes contemplation, described as devoted thought that is not deluded. In a third part, to clarify this view of contemplation, the paper draws on stories of professional development and teaching. Fourth, applying the counterargument to the literature on teachers' professional life cycles, the suggestion is made that a distinction exists between focusing on the classroom in the service of the teacher's self (\"personal interiority\") and focusing on the classroom in the service of teaching and students (\"professional interiority\"). Only the second form of interiority is held to be consistent with professional development and school improvement. (Author/AMH)",

Each of the 10 methods is discussed in terms of its distinctive purpose, the theories of inquiry that are applicable, the kinds of questions the method is capable of addressing, and the logic of the procedure it employs. While these analytic distinctions can be made, in actual curriculum research practice, more than one of the methods may be used together within a single study. A continuum may be noticed through the 10 methods of inquiry from the more disciplinary  methods associated with the academic disciplines to the more multidisciplinary methods associated with fields of practice. Over 150 references are listed. (JD)",

These minorities include Hispanics, American Indians, Asian Americans, and African Americans. In physical education, as in other disciplines, currently the number of minority professionals in teaching is declining. Through a review of literature on minorities, the paper addresses relevant topics that may enhance understanding of minority issues in physical education. The major topics addressed are: (1) the factors affecting the participation of minorities in teaching, (2) the nature of minority teacher representation in teaching, and (3) ways for increasing the number of ethnic minorities in physical education. Also under consideration are complex factors that have an impact on  participation of minorities in the teaching force: the number of years of schooling which affects the rate of entering minorities into teacher education; access to educational opportunities which enhance growth and employment; and the loss of minorities as role models in the teaching profession.

It is contended that, as a whole, standardized tests do not measure much. Current standardized multiple-choice tests are severely flawed, based on assumptions about human ability that cannot be proven, with inadequate content and construct validity. An agenda for test reform calls for the use of \"authentic\" or \"performance-based\" evaluation, using properly constructed, validated, and administered tests. Schools, test-takers, and  independent researchers should have access to data needed to verify test publishers' claims about their tests. Both test developers and test users have the obligation to promote proper, reasonable, and limited use of standardized tests as one of a series of assessment mechanisms.

One week before their final examination, the students were given a 15-minute classroom introduction to the TFT, part of the Silva Mental Training Method (1983). After the introduction to this conditioned trigger that assists in improving mental focus and concentration, students participated in a 15-minute relaxation exercise and received instructions on using the method for studying and for taking tests. A Likert-type questionnaire was used to determine student attitudes about the technique and its use. Almost all of the students (80%) felt that the relaxation exercise was helpful. All of the students reported that they felt  anxiety on previous tests. Of the 13 students who used the technique, during the exam, 8 felt less anxiety than on previous tests, 3 maintained the same level of anxiety as on previous tests, and 2 felt more anxious than on previous tests. In an evaluation of aspects of the course, students ranked the relaxation exercise third in usefulness, after the course textbook and course lectures. One bar graph is included. (SLD)",

These effects were studied for black students as well as for all students regardless of race, across 2 years. The student population was composed of over 4,800 fourth- through eighth-grade students, assigned to language arts and mathematics classes on the basis of their scores on the California Achievement Test Battery taken in the spring prior to class assignment. This method of grouping had been approved by the Office for Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Education with the stipulation that student achievement be evaluated every year. When the effects of &quot;bona fide&quot; homogeneous grouping were  summarized for all children regardless of race, detrimental effects predominated. Examination of the 2-year effects for black students revealed mixed results for language arts and consistently detrimental effects for mathematics. The use of &quot;bona fide&quot; homogeneous grouping appeared clearly beneficial only to black students whose initial language arts achievement scores were low. These findings suggest that the assignment of students on the basis of homogeneous grouping should be questioned. Nine graphs illustrate the performance of groups, and 14 tables summarize study data.

It is argued that experimentwise Type I error rate inflation can be serious and that its influences are often unnoticed in ANOVA applications. Both classical balanced omnibus and orthogonal planned contrast tests inflate experimentwise error to an identifiable maximum. Significance test results are overinterpreted in contemporary analytic practice, and researchers must consider effect sizes and replicability or invariance analyses when formulating interpretations. To guide analytic practice, it is suggested that omnibus hypotheses that are not of interest or which cannot be interpreted should not be tested, since such tests can distort hypothesis tests that are of interest. Orthogonal contrasts should  be preferred over non-orthogonal contrasts. The use of planned contrasts is suggested in place of omnibus or unplanned hypothesis tests. Use of planned comparisons tends to result in more thoughtful research with greater power against Type II error. Small data sets and examples support the discussion, and nine tables illustrate these examples. A 73-item list of references is included. (SLD)",

Students appear to notice gender communication pattern differences, and these differences are related to specific  evaluation items. Differences in socialization affect student evaluation of instruction; sociocultural stereotyping is a field requiring a great deal of study. The implications for future research are: teacher evaluation instruments should be analyzed for gender and race differences in communication patterns; general university-wide, or faculty-wide, norms should not be established; a useful evaluation system should include common contextual variable norms; and research is needed in sociocultural contexts to ensure that instruments for measuring student evaluation of instruction are not based on stereotypes. Five tables summarize the discussion. A 49-item list of references is included. (SLD)",

        "description":"The development and validation of a new instrument, the School-Level Environment Questionnaire (SLEQ), are described. The SLEQ measures teachers' perceptions of psychosocial dimensions of the environment of the school. The SLEQ consists of 56 items, each scored on a five-point scale, and grouped in eight scales: (1) student support; (2) affiliation; (3) professional interest; (4) staff freedom; (5) participatory decision making; (6) innovation; (7) resource adequacy; and (8) work pressure. The SLEQ was validated with three samples from Australian schools: 83 teachers from 19 metropolitan elementary and secondary schools in Sydney; 34 secondary school beginning teachers in New South Wales; and 109 elementary and secondary teachers in Tasmania. Results indicate that each SLEQ scale  displayed satisfactory internal consistency with satisfactory discriminant validity results, suggesting that distinct, but somewhat overlapping, aspects of school environment were measured. The SLEQ was used, in the Tasmanian sample, to determine differences in the climates of elementary and secondary schools. It was also used to evaluate teachers' efforts to improve school environment in a study of 15 elementary teachers in a pretest/posttest evaluation of improvement efforts. Four tables and two graphs present data from these studies; an appendix provides the SLEQ. A 33-item list of references is included. (SLD)",

        "description":"Although the issue of dimensionality of the data obtained from educational and psychological tests has received considerable attention, the terms &quot;unidimensional&quot; and &quot;multidimensional&quot; have not been used very precisely. One use of the term dimensionality is to refer to the number of hypothesized psychological constructs believed to be required for successful performance on a test; this is &quot;psychological dimensionality.&quot; A second use is to refer to the minimum number of mathematical variables needed to summarize a matrix of item response data; this is &quot;statistical dimensionality&quot; (SD). This paper presents a framework for discussing the SD of dichotomous data matrices of item response data. It is suggested that dimensionality refers to the number of dimensions needed to summarize  a data matrix that results from interactions of a set of test items and a group of examinees. Two cases are presented to summarize the circumstances under which a set of test items will generate unidimensional data when responded to by a population of individuals. In the first case, all items are sensitive to the same combination of skills in the same manner. The second situation is when psychological dimensions are strongly confounded with the difficulty of the test items. Fourteen perspective, contour, or vector plots illustrate the discussion. (SLD)",

        "description":"Possible bias due to sampling problems or low response rates has been a troubling \"nuisance\" variable in empirical research since seminal and classical studies were done on these problems at the beginning of this century. Recent research suggests that: (1) earlier views of the alleged bias problem were misleading; (2) under a variety of fairly well-specified conditions, allegedly biased samples are in fact random; and (3) \"de facto\" biased samples can and will \"jump\" from being biased to being random samples. These conditions occur when the population is fuzzy and dynamic and when the number of factors structuring the population and those influencing responding or non-responding are large, interact with each other, and have a trivial effect, at best. Researchers and theorists may  be rejecting and disregarding what might be reasonable and highly valid data. Actual data from a number of state-wide studies with response rates in the 15% to 30% range illustrate this view. A variety of simulation studies is needed to evaluate these views on bias. The Catastrophe Theory of non-linear functions, family-wise error rates, and fuzzy subset theory are also considered. (Author/SLD)",

Unusually effective schools were identified by examining the residuals of a multiple regression analysis. It was hypothesized that certain schools would be unusually effective, in that graduates would have higher grade point averages (GPAs) than would be expected given their academic aptitude as measured by the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and by their socioeconomic environment. The analysis was conducted using 111,703 freshmen in a large univesity system from 301 high schools and 162 school systems. Multiple regression  equations predicting college GPA were developed for each institution by gender and minority status. Independent variables included: SAT scores; the proportions of free and reduced lunches at each high school; and college experience as measured by credit hours attempted and earned. There was a clear tendency for rural schools to nurture graduates who achieved higher GPAs than SAT scores or socioeconomic status would predict. Urban schools were more likely to produce students of lower achievement than predicted. The method appears promising for extending assessment perspectives beyond internal college or university concerns. (SLD)",

Factor analysis was used to examine the construct validity of the section.

Five additional data sets were similar in composition to the first set, with total sizes of 415, 747, 822, 1,200, and 1,311, respectively. These subsequent data sets also included  elementary and high school students and administrators.

        "description":"The contributions of instructional design to cognitive science are discussed. It is argued that both sciences have their own object of study, but share a common interest in human cognition and performance as part of instructional systems. From a case study based on experience in teaching introductory computer programming, it is concluded that both sciences may reciprocally influence each other. Cognitive science often conducts research on cognitive processes in &quot;silent&quot; instructional strategies, so that guidelines for improving instructional systems are limited to those strategies. Instructional design conducts research on &quot;spoken&quot; instructional strategies, and observations of students working according to those strategies may provide evidence for the importance of particular  cognitive processes that are neglected in current cognitive theories. However, these implications are also limited because they cannot lead to detailed descriptions of those cognitive processes. With regard to the tangent plane between cognitive science and instructional design (such as the field of intelligent tutoring systems), it is argued that these sciences must work together to reach their common goals. The ACT theory of skill acquisition is included in the discussion. (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"In December 1993, children who were in grade 3 in the Trenton Public Schools (New Jersey) in 1985-86 will take a high-risk writing proficiency test to determine whether they will graduate from high school. An emerging study of the writing of the Class of 1995 in Trenton is described as students move toward that test. The activity of studying writing is described as a process of staff development. The study began in 1986 when the first samples of writing were collected from third-grade and sixth-grade students; 868 and 758 papers of third graders in 1986 and 1987, respectively, and 879 and 697 papers of sixth graders in 1986 and 1987, respectively, were analyzed. These samples established a baseline for program evaluation. Further information was collected in a large sampling (688  students) when the students were in grade 6 in 1989 and from random samplings (200-350 papers) in 1987 and 1988. Papers were coded by teacher, class, and school, and filed by grade and year. Scorers used 1986 and 1987 papers to select model papers representing a range of the children's work as developmental markers for the curriculum and as a working baseline and basis for two guides forming a writing evaluation system. The study has revealed much about the writing of children in Trenton schools, and it represents an initial step in finding ways of predicting the success of students and classes. The investigation holds the potential to enable generalizations about Trenton's instructional programs for young writers. Reconstructions of the individual portfolios of students will be a  springboard for descriptions of how students in the Trenton schools learn to write. Appendices include a student portfolio profile sheet, two data tables, two graphs, directions and guidelines for teachers administering the preliminary writing tests, and data charts for test results.

In the study, learners were prompted via motivational messages into modifying their disposition to engage in learning tasks. The setting was an instructional design course for training personnel connected with a ministry in Mozambique. Subjects were 22 regular employees of the ministry and seven special students with limited time to participate; the sample included 19 males and 10 females. A naturalistic mode of inquiry was identified as the most appropriate one for the inquiry and a case study approach, from an embedded multiple-case perspective, was chosen. Basic  research questions included: (1) the validity of the motivational messages; (2) how and why the messages worked; and (3) the messages' optimal function and its continuation over time. Of the 10 propositions formed about the messages and the learners, instructor, and environment, nine were found to hold true when tested in the original study and a second study 3 years later. It is concluded that motivational messages should be considered an integrating part of a complex motivational system. The case study approach was found well-suited to the research concerns. (SLD)",

Cognitive functioning was assessed using the Measure of Epistemological Reflection (MER) of M. B. Taylor (1983). Students also completed a Life Events Questionnaire concerning events in their recent past. Seventy-five of the freshmen were retested after 1 year. Several factor analyses explored the structure of the MER. Significant life events were found to be associated with a higher level of cognitive functioning. The most pervasive was the personal experience of intense inner insight. Other themes that were seen with some consistency were: (1) experienced divorce,  separation, or the end of a serious love relationship; (2) experienced major change in church activity; (3) experienced sexual difficulties; and (4) independently made an important life decision. Scores on the MER showed only modest positive correlations, suggesting that the total score should be viewed with caution as an index of cognitive development. This finding was supported by the factor analyses, which indicated more than one factor, suggesting that cognitive development might be better described with two scores.

The reform effort was part of the Arizona Career Ladder pilot program. The district within which the study was completed achieved great gains in restructuring and identifying needs concerning teacher performance characteristics and how they relate to student achievement. A model for profiling teacher characteristics and their relationship to student achievement was developed. The reliability and validity of the specially developed instrument, the Self-Perception Characteristics Survey, were  established in close collaboration among school district and university personnel through a study involving 1,080 responses to the teacher self-description profile. Factor analysis of the 12 subsections of the instrument--setting goals and objectives, planning, making decisions, student assessment, self-assessment, time effectiveness, communicating, building and maintaining relationships, developing other staff, demonstrating commitment, improving instruction, and school effectiveness--indicated that in all cases, over 75% of the variance was accounted for by five or fewer factors. The results highlight the advantages of the collaboration between researchers and practitioners in the assessment and rebuilding of schools and in building and validating the connection between teacher  characteristics and student achievement.

        "description":"A strategy that has been initiated to respond to assertions that out-of-date norms distort standardized achievement test results involves annually updating the norms for achievement tests to avoid the production of inflated scores through aging norms. The effect of the application of normative trend data to the obtained test results in an urban school district was evaluated. The analysis included data for the Spring 1988 administration of the California Achievement Test (CAT), Form E, in reading (n=54,871) and mathematics (n=17,722). The district participated, with a number of other schools, in CTB/McGraw Hill's Normative Trend Data (NTD) project, which involved renorming the CAT for that year. Data were then applied to the original results to transform the obtained frequency  distributions for each subtest at each grade. Redistributed scores were then compared to the original distributions to assess the impact of the updated norms. The use of NTD data resulted in lowering the measure of achievement levels in reading and mathematics. NTD scores positively skewed the district's grade level achievement distributions. Annual national performance appeared to improve relative to the original standardization sample. Longitudinal comparisons for the district must, however, rely on the original standardization, and the interpretation and explanation of two sets of scores in a district compromise the utility of the results. An appendix contains 55 figures illustrating test score distributions. (SLD)",

        "description":"When the Educational Testing Service became the administrator of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in 1983, it introduced scales based on item response theory (IRT) as a way of presenting results of the assessment to the general public. Some properties of the scales and their uses are discussed. Initial attempts at presenting the assessment results reported the percent correct statistics for each individual item. IRT-based NAEP scales avoid the problems of average percent correct statistics and summarize complex information by reducing a large data set into a few manageable and interpretable summary statistics. The dimensionality of data sets has been studied to protect against losing important information in the summarization process. Research into scaling  has demonstrated that, in most cases, the data support creating a single developmental scale. The NAEP also produces a global summary, using a weighted average of the domain scores. Scale anchoring is accomplished by describing what students at selected levels know and can do. A typical anchoring process is described. Three figures illustrate the use of NAEP scales. (SLD)",

        "description":"The use of optical scanners and computers in educational testing is common where objective testing methods (such as true-false, matching, and multiple-choice items) are well-established means of evaluating educational achievement. Where non-objective testing methods (such as fill-in-the-blank, short-answer, and essay items) have been more common, however, the diffusion of automated test scoring processes may be slow. A classification model of world patterns of educational testing methods at the university level is outlined. The three patterns are characterized as: (1) maximum current usage of machine scoring, as found in introductory courses with large numbers of students; (2) little use of machine scoring in spite of the financial resources to do so; and (3) very little use of  machine scoring and few financial resources to support it. The first pattern mainly signifies universities in the United States; the second model refers to universities found throughout Europe and some American schools; and the third pattern refers mainly to developing countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. The ways in which these patterns are expected to change in response to contemporary demographic, economic, and technological factors are discussed. One technological factor is the recent development of the Multi-Digit Testing technique, which generates computer-scorable test items equivalent to fill-in-the-blank items, thus combining the academic rigor of free recall items with up-to-date educational testing technology.

Up to 1,000 alternative answers may appear on a single sheet. A single list can often be sufficient for an entire course because it is the &quot;answer blank&quot; for thousands of questions. The MDT method has been used in university courses with over 6,000 students in a number of disciplines. More than half the students found the method as desirable as or more desirable than  other testing methods. A sample test for cell biology is provided, and instructions are given for making an answer key for hand scoring. A software system for machine-scoring has recently become available, and software under development will address issues of higher order thinking more fully.

MMLE estimation uses a numerical analysis technique to integrate examinees' abilities over the ability distribution for item and ability parameter estimations because of the difficulty of direct integration with a digital computer. For integrating ability, the values of quadrature points and the weights corresponding to each quadrature point are specified. The Gauss-Hermite quadrature formula and R. J. Mislevy's histogram solution (1984) have been used for numerical integration over the normal density function. It was  determined that the Gauss-Hermite quadrature formula and Mislevy's graphical solution via MMLE estimated item and ability parameters equally when a large number of quadrature points was specified. When a small number of quadrature points was specified, Mislevy's histogram solution via the MMLE approach estimated item and ability parameters more accurately than did the Gauss-Hermite quadrature formula.

The three previous studies indicated that, if the sample characteristics had been estimated on the basis of respondents rather than the entire sample, the conclusions would have deviated from the true sample by 4.8%, 2.1%, and 2.8%, respectively.

In the second study in 1989, a customer satisfaction study, 149 out of 150 people  responded, a rate of 99%. In the third study in 1989, 928 telephone interviews were completed out of 969 households, for a response rate of 96%. Data from all six studies indicated that response rates of at least from 65% to 75% are needed before non-response bias is reduced to a level where it is not likely to have a significant effect on decision making.

Data were collected eight times between June 1988 and January 1990 using the  Stages of Concern Questionnaire (SCQ) and teacher self-reporting of classroom writing strategies. Subjects included 15 teachers of the 1988 SI and 21 teachers of the 1989 SI. Data from the SCQ indicate a shift in concerns from informational to collaboration at the end of the 5-week SIs for both the 1988 and 1989 groups. Data from self-reports indicate successes in adoption of writing process instruction in the areas of content and idea building, defining rhetorical stance, and highlighting student writing. Implications for the project include extended training in underutilized components of writing process instruction--development and ordering of ideas, assisting students with linguistic choices, and revision practices. Additionally, the project should pursue consensus-building activities  within rural communities to support collaboration on a writing process model of teaching. A writing process instruction checklist is included. (Author/TJH)",

In this light, a Soar computational model of self-explanation strategies of instructional text was examined. The subjects, 12 students with little or no computer programming experience, proceeded through a series of lessons in the LISP Tutor program on recursion. Subjects, who were asked to think aloud, were videotaped as they read through an instructional booklet prior to solving problems using the Tutor. Subjects were also asked to explain examples to themselves. After reading their texts,  subjects worked through 12 recursion problems with the LISP Tutor. Subjects were then divided into groups of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;poor&quot; performers. The verbal protocols were segmented into elaborations, which are pause-bound utterances and are not a first reading of the text. Each elaboration was categorized in terms of the instructional content to which it referred and to one of six types of comments. Sequences of related elaborations were coded into episodes (or macro-codings). Results indicate a strong correlation between types and contents of elaborations made and subsequent problem-solving performance. Self-explanations of &quot;good&quot; students were much more structured into goal-based episodes than were those of &quot;poor&quot; students, indicating more persistence on the part of the &quot;good&quot; students.

Attention reduction training (ART) is based on the dual task assessment procedure developed by researchers in the area of memory. The technique involves having subjects respond to two tasks simultaneously. The issue of vertical transfer of training is central to the model. Vertical transfer describes a condition in which a subordinate skill is used when performing a superordinate skill; the notion that two or more skills may be related in a hierarchical fashion becomes paramount to this view of transfer. Whereas training aimed at skill mastery focuses primarily on performance accuracy, ART extends skill performance criteria to include  speed (reaction time) and other measures related to the reduction of attentional resources (i.e., the ability to process two or more tasks concurrently). From this perspective, it is maintained that the development of fluent or automatic intellectual skills is content specific and should be approached from the perspective of detailed hierarchical analysis techniques. The consistent mapping practice procedure can be used to reduce attentional resources related to the secondary skill/task and to test the hypothesis that this ART facilitates vertical transfer. Issues related to instructional development include motivation, incrementing task workload, use of multiple primacy tasks, optimal primary task workload, and speeded training techniques.

        "description":"This paper focuses on the challenges of using photographic evidence while conducting evaluation and research. The viability of photo-interviewing is discussed as part of a perception-based model of evaluation to describe and judge a technology infusion program in higher education. The program involved the use of a software tool, HyperCard, as a means of integrating many of the short- and long-term technology goals of the College of Education at the University of South Alabama (Mobile). Major evaluation questions, developed through negotiations among program participants, addressed the nature of participants and participation; the nature and effectiveness of training; the use of microcomputers in classrooms of participating faculty; other training taken by faculty participants;  the impact of computer use on students; and outcomes, follow-ups, and replication strategies. Subjects participated in an &quot;Introduction to HyperCard&quot; workshop, during which they were photographed at selected times. One month after subjects participated in the workshop, photo-interviews were conducted with four groups of workshop participants (N=19 out of 27 students). Evaluators used a five-phase process to select photographs and clarify data derived from the oral interviews. Offering promise in bridging physical and psychological realities, this study applied a photoanalysis model to extend oral interview data gathered from a hypermedia training program. Four polemics concerning photo-interviewing as a tool of inquiry are presented. Four sample photographs are included. (TJH)",

        "description":"Advantages and disadvantages of standard Rasch analysis computer programs are discussed. The unconditional maximum likelihood algorithm allows all observations to participate equally in determining the measures and calibrations to be obtained quickly from a data set. On the advantage side, standard Rasch programs can be used immediately, are debugged and accurate, and can report statistics that are difficult to calculate. On the disadvantage side, the user must have the correct hardware, conclusions based on numbers appearing in the output are not necessarily valid, and the effort involved in producing one's own program can be considerable. Guidelines for writing programs, including those that surpass standard programs, are provided; and sample output from a number of standard  programs is examined for strong and weak points. Emphasis is on adequate and useful statistics presented as easily comprehended graphical output. Topics discussed include: estimated measure, standard error, goodness of fit, plotting fit, presenting the variable, and differential item functioning or bias. Eleven figures and a BASIC program for performing unconditional maximum likelihood estimations are provided. (TJH)",

        "description":"Rank ordering examinees is an easier task for judges than is awarding numerical ratings. A measurement model for rankings based on Rasch's objectivity axioms provides linear, sample-independent and judge-independent measures. Estimates of examinee measures are obtained from the data set of rankings, along with standard errors and fit statistics. Judge quality-control fit statistics are also obtained for each ordering. An example is provided comparing rating and ranking of an essay examination. Even though rank ordering does not perform measurement as precisely as does a highly discriminating rating scale, measures obtained from rankings can be comparable to those obtained from rating scales commonly in use in certifying situations. The simplification of judge training and the  easing of the burden on the judge resulting from the use of rank ordering rather than rating scales suggest that this technique merits close scrutiny by examination boards that currently rely on judges to rate examinee performance. Five tables and three figures are included. (Author/TJH)",

For confirmatory analysis, the developer's intentions inform the choice of the general form of the model, representing the manner in which the respondent interacts with the scale; these intentions also inform the choice of the precise statement of that form, representing the intention of the analyst to construct, for example, an &quot;equal-interval&quot; scale. The nature of the Likert rating scale is discussed. Examples of general forms and precise statements are given. Forms of the measurement model discussed include the dichotomous case, the Andrich model for holistic scales, the Glas model for incremental scales, and the McCullagh model for incidental scales.  Means of modeling and communicating the intentional form of the scale are outlined.

        "author":["Kirst, Michael W."],
        "description":"This paper presents research findings to help policymakers understand and select various options for holding schools accountable for their performance and to help them devise a multistrategy accountability system. However, it does not recommend one system over another, since a given accountability option must be compatible and adapted to particular State and local contexts. Education policy has advanced historically through incremental or trial-and-error stages (\"disjointed incrementalism\"), as exemplified in the area of accountability. The lessons policymakers can learn from more than a century of experience with accountability are reviewed; and failures and false starts, and promising practices are considered. Six broad approaches to accountability are discussed: (1)  accountability through performance reporting; (2) accountability through monitoring and compliance with standards/regulations, (3) accountability through incentive systems; (4) accountability through reliance on the market; (5) accountability through changing the locus of authority or control of schools; and (6) accountability through changing professional roles. It is contended that State or local governments must use several of these approaches simultaneously. Since accountability is one of several strategies to improve/restructure education in the United States, policymakers should pay particular attention to analyses presented in this paper concerning potential conflicts between specific accountability systems and other reforms. Appendix A discusses issues of local accountability for  California, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and Florida; and Appendix B describes the California Model School Accountability Report Card.

        "description":"This document comprises an assessment of the educational needs of newly legalized aliens in California that must be met using State Legalization Impact Assistance Grants (SLIAGs) provided under the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986. Close to 1.5 million of the 1.7 million eligible legalized aliens are adults with very limited educational backgrounds and limited English-speaking proficiency. The following levels of need are considered: (1) approximately 856,000 pre-1982 immigrants must enroll in a federally approved English and United States citizenship certification course by December 1990 to satisfy the requirements of IRCA; (2) approximately 1 million are eligible for educational services under California's State plan for serving the legalized alien population;  and (3) 1.5 million are eligible for educational services provided under the SLIAG program. While SLIAG funding statewide appears adequate to meet the need, there is a critical mismatch of services with need at the local level. Recommendations for improvement include the following: (1) if the State Legislature is unable to ensure adequate course availability for pre-1982 immigrants in 1988/89, the State should petition Congress to extend the deadline for compliance with the IRCA; (2) the legislature should assume a strong leadership and oversight role in implementing the IRCA and should assess its long-term impact on adult education; (3) the State Department of Education should address the levels of educational services in currently underserved counties; and (4) funding disincentives  should be reduced and funding formulas should be adjusted to adequately reflect costs and program needs.

Race relations have declined during the 1980s as evidenced by the erosion of many of the gains of the civil rights movement and a resurgence of overt racism. The white ruling class expresses occasional interest in and concern for minority groups through the formation of study commissions to minimize social, economic, and political costs and regain American hegemony in the world. The findings of the following studies indicate that despite the needs of growing minority populations, an insufficient number of minority group teachers  are being prepared for roles in schools and institutions of higher learning: (1) \"One Third of a Nation\" (Commission on Minority Participation in Education and American Life, 1988); (2) the 1985 findings of the National Coalition of Advocates for Students; (3) \"An Imperiled Generation\" (Carnegie Foundation, 1988); (4) \"A Nation Prepared: Teachers for the 21st Century\" (Carnegie Foundation, 1986); (5) \"Tomorrow's Teachers\" (Holmes Group, 1986); and (6) \"Teaching as a Profession: The Challenge for Oregon\" (Oregon State Legislature, 1986). Furthermore, a study of the knowledge and attitudes of 202 undergraduate education majors at Lewis and Clark College conducted between 1983 and 1986 indicates that current teacher education is not preparing teachers who are sensitive to the cultural  backgrounds and world views of black students. National commitment to multicultural education is only a first step to reforming national and global social and economic structures. A list of 25 references is appended. (FMW)",

The following evaluation points are addressed in this report: (1) the percentages of students passing the TEAMS each year; (2) the changes in the percent of students passing the TEAMS each year; (3) statistically significant differences between 1986-87 and 1988-89 TEAMS passing rates; and (4) the mean grade equivalent scores of the students each year. Overall, the findings indicate that the program was instrumental in improving the performance of students in the program schools. Generally, it seems that the grade that had the largest gains from the program was the third grade cohort. Twelve figures and 12 tables are included.  (JS)",

The Project for Secondary School Improvement was a 3-year program designed to assist secondary schools in 19 Michigan districts in implementing improvement models based on the research on effective schools and effective teaching. The program's first year focused on training five-person teams in a Madeline Hunter model called Essential Elements of Effective Instruction (EEEI). During years two and three, the project was split into two strands comprised of 26 school teams that used the School Improvement Based on Effective Schools Research model and 11 schools that used an extension of the EEEI model. Services included ten days of training  for the schools that selected the Effective Schools model, assisting districts to develop support and plans, and support for all 37 schools. Overall, the program fulfilled its purpose to enhance teaching skills, improve building-level climate factors, increase administrator skills, and encourage the development of district-wide improvement plans. Recommendations for the improvement of administrator training and district-wide policy development are suggested. The following materials are appended: (1) a report on a strategic planning workshop; (2) an executive report submitted by the project director and two consultants; (3) a copy of the effective teaching inventory questionnaire and a statistical tabulation of the responses; (4) a summary of telephone interviews with teachers and  principals; (5) a summary of the second-year telephone interviews; and (6) a copy of the inventory of effective schools concepts and the statistical tabulation of the responses.

Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988, on domestic and foreign tutoring programs for disadvantaged elementary and secondary students that involve college students. This volume summarizes the results of the mandated study, which was expanded to include mentoring programs. The programs had the following positive effects on disadvantaged students: (1) improved test scores, grades, and overall academic performance; (2) improved motivation and attitude towards education; (3) increased familiarity with environments other than their own; and (4) improved self-esteem and self-confidence. The programs had the following positive effects on  college students: (1) they obtained practical experience and improved leadership and communication skills; (2) developed a greater commitment to community service; and (3) increased their self-esteem and self-confidence. Positive effects were associated with programs with the following structures: (1) defined time commitments from tutors and mentors; (2) systematic screening of prospective tutors and mentors and matching with younger students; (3) thorough training and monitoring of tutors and mentors; and (4) close relations between the sponsoring colleges and participating school systems. The following federal programs could provide assistance to tutoring and mentoring programs: (1) Chapter 1 and 2 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act; (2) the Fund for the Improvement of  Postsecondary Education; and (3) the College Work Study Program.

However, not only do black college students not choose education as often as other professions, but black high school students do not choose to attend college as readily as members of other minority groups. Should these trends continue, minority group teachers may represent as little as five percent of the national teaching force by the turn of the century. Black teachers are needed to serve as role models, to teach cultural diversity, and to supplement the projected general teacher shortage. Various strategies have been suggested to encourage blacks and other minorities to enter the teaching profession. Those that involve increased  salaries, raised status for classroom teachers, teacher empowerment, and reform of teacher education programs are not likely to be implemented. Strategies that focus on minority-specific recruitment, two-year and four-year college partnerships, and alternative certification procedures are more likely to be implemented.

Three hundred seventy-three members of a state agency in a small southwestern city completed a questionnaire prior to receiving a 2-hour training session about AIDS. Subjects reported relative comfort in talking about all of these topics when directly asked to rate their level of comfort. In talking about AIDS, 81% of the subjects reported using direct forms of communication, and 43% used indirect forms. Analysis of variance yielded  statistically significant differences between men and women on their comfort levels in discussing AIDS. There were no significant gender differences on the other taboo topics. Significant differences also existed between religious attenders and non-attenders. There were no significant patterns with other demographic variables. Correlations between comfort level and use of direct and indirect communication revealed that men reported significantly less comfort in talking about AIDS and reported significantly greater use of indirect forms of communication than women.

A review of the literature revealed that the course has been typically viewed as a public speaking course taught in self-contained sections with one instructor responsible for teaching 20-25 students. While theoretical rifts abound, major deviations from the predominance of public speaking are found in isolated situations only. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the emphasis did not change; however, a significant change has taken place in the basic course as a result of pragmatic issues. Economics, in particular, have encouraged the use of more graduate assistants and have forced departments to look for ways to  increase enrollments without sacrificing quality. In the 1980s experimentation was done with a new teaching technique called Personalized System of Instruction (PSI)--a format which uses large groups of students (often 70 or more) with one instructor. Continued experimentation with new formats for instruction and research into optimal learning of communication skills appear to be called for. (Thirty-seven references are attached.) (KEH)",

The decentralization of authority to lower echelons more familar with local needs may provide a more relevant administration that encourages local initiatives; school and education development are facilitated when the administration caters to local and school needs. To probe the system of educational administration in Korea and to present measures for assisting with the realization of school-centered administration in the country, in June and July 1986, questionnaires were mailed to 500 supervisors and administrators working for the provincial boards of education, 750 teachers, and 150 administrators  of the country offices of education from 13 provinces and cities. Additionally, a literature review on the topic was conducted and seminars were held to open the process of study to a wide range of input. Suggestions generated by the findings include minimizing evaluations and inspections by administrative authorities to encourage self-evaluation by the schools' operation evaluation committees, liberalizing control over financial matters, and automating administrative tasks so teachers and administrators are able to devote more time and effort to the improvement of professional competency.

        "description":"Finding an unequivocable answer to the class size issue is vitally important to the future of American public education. Sorting out conflicting viewpoints and determining supportable conclusions are this report's primary purpose. Three factors--research motivation, the effects of confounding variables, and problems related to distinguishing between student achievement and other classroom process changes--are largely responsible for the divergent, sometimes conflicting views expressed in the literature. For all student populations, class size research shows an important link between lowered student/teacher ratios and higher achievement. This conclusion can be reached by using appropriate complex statistical methods and research designs promoted by the National Education  Association. An extensive literature review yields seven related conclusions: (1) class size research has had a history of limited research design, inappropriate methodology, and biased literature reviews; (2) the most seriously misleading conclusions have often been repeated in subsequent analyses; (3) development of a theoretical framework for determining class size influences on learning has been slow; (4) various studies have shown that achievement effects are mediated by changes in teachers' handling of classroom responsibilities; (5) alternative cost-effective strategies for reducing effective group size are available; (6) redeployment of existing school staff offers the most promising strategy for reducing instructional group size; and (7) some class reduction benefits can be  gained by creative redistribution of students and incorporation of small-class techniques into routine classroom practice.

Three main federal statutes have protected women's rights in education since 1972. These are the Title IX of the Educational Amendments Act of 1972, the Women's Educational Equity Act passed in 1975, and the Vocational Amendments Act of 1976. In addition, 13 states have enacted legislation that parallels Title IX, and 31 states have some legislation prohibiting sex discrimination in primary and secondary education programs. The implementation of the three federal laws dealing with gender equity are reviewed in detail. The specific changes and achievements have occurred in the areas of textbook materials, curriculum content, teacher training, access of women to  advanced educational programs, presence of women in educational institutions as faculty and administrators, and incentives for students. Several elements exist between the legislation and the observed outcomes; these elements focus on inputs in place, transformations in educational organizations, and transformations in students.

Changes in these equity measures over an 8-year period are assessed, and some of the correlates of equity at the state level are evaluated. This report uses consistently calculated equity measures: &quot;horizontal equity&quot; and &quot;equal opportunity.&quot; Given any pupil resource, horizontal equity asks, &quot;Do students receive equal amounts of this resource?&quot; Equal opportunity raises the question, &quot;Is the distribution of pupil resources independent school district wealth, as measured by a given indicator?&quot; The two student resource variables used are per pupil operating  expenditures and the teacher-student ratio. Also examined are per pupil revenues by major sources of revenues (local, state, and federal). In the analysis of the relationship between district wealth and equal opportunity, three variables are used: median family income, poverty concentration, and property wealth. Two methods of assessing equal opportunity are used in this analysis: the simple correlation coefficient measures the association between wealth and resource levels within a state; the second method is the display of separate averages of the student resource variables by groups of school districts, classified into one of four quartiles of wealth. Data are displayed in 16 tables and 7 figures. (MLF)",

For some teachers, peer coaching seems to stimulate transformations in self-perception and relations with supervisors. For others, not much seems different. During discussions with survey participants, three classifications of principal leadership styles emerged; teachers viewed their principals as either neglecters, resisters, or supporters of peer coaching. The first group was motivated by central office expectations; the second resisted peer coaching inservice training in an effort to protect administrative power and authority; and the  third group was knowledgeable, involved in the program, and eager to identify problems and seek solutions. Teachers with neglecter principals frequently bypassed the administration and adopted a somewhat paternalistic attitude toward these principals. Teachers with resister principals became creative at releasing each other for class observations without permission from the principal and carried out peer coaching functions in an atmosphere of secrecy. Teachers with supporter principals felt empowered. These teachers experienced an ever-deepening professional relationship with the principal that blurred lines of influence and stressed shared authority and accountability. Implications for strategy decisions based on these findings are summarized. (16 references) (MLH)",

The legal trends in censorship issues, as they can be deduced from Supreme Court cases, are very broad and appear to be allowing schools broad discretion with respect to curriculum materials, methods, and programs. Good internal communications and public relations offer the best way to avoid unnecessary controversy. The district must specify criteria for making  curriculum judgments, identify personnel to make those decisions, and provide written rationales for including or excluding potentially controversial materials.

School officials can investigate demographic changes in their district in several ways, but it is recommended to compare enrollment by grade level to establish  migration rates. As a result of shifting cultural makeup of student enrollment, the nation's schools will have to create productive, multicultural environments and address issues of racism and ethnicity. Comprehensive help to at-risk and low-achieving students is recommended. (11 references) (SI)",

        "description":"To ensure that first-time educators in any of Ohio's 615 school systems have access to a supportive environment that would make their professional success more likely, in 1987 the state's Department of Education enacted a policy requiring all school districts to plan and implement programs that provide support to newly employed educators. Because no single &quot;Entry Year Model&quot; was mandated for adoption across the state, and because little direction was provided to school districts regarding the precise nature of the Entry Year Program, the project naturally became an activity of the Ohio Leadership in Educational Administration Development Center. To date, work related to the Entry Year Standard has revolved around two specific areas. First, a resource guide, which is summarized  within this document, was developed containing nine chapters, each directed toward an important element of the standard to assist those persons responsible for the implementation of the program in the state's local school systems. And second, training activities designed to enable people to learn more about the concept of mentoring for beginning principals--a significant part of the Entry Year Standard--are being conducted around the state during this present year. The Ohio Entry Year Standard is appended. (KM)",

        "author":["Moore, Donald R."],
        "description":"The Chicago Public Schools have recently been restructured by the Illinois General Assembly, radically altering patterns of governance (voice) and patterns of choice in Chicago. This paper analyzes the history of the Chicago restructuring campaign and the specific conception of school-based governance enacted into law. The paper also analyzes the school choice system that has existed in Chicago, its inequities for students at risk, and the effect of Chicago's past experience with choice on the content of the new school restructuring law. The paper then advances conclusions based on the Chicago experience and relevant research applicable to voice and choice issues in big cities. One essential feature of effective school-based management is giving majority control of school  policy-making councils to parents and citizens, not to principals and teachers. Genuine educational improvement depends on the presence of other features, such as training for participation on these councils provided by groups independent of the school system, significantly increased principal accountability and authority, limitations on central administration's role, and availability of advisory resources for assisting schools in the change process. In Chicago and other big cities, choice programs have typically operated to increase the isolation of at-risk students, and have thus become a new form of discriminatory tracking. Creating equitable choice programs is not just a &quot;program design&quot; issue. Unless a school system makes and implements a fundamental commitment to improve educational  services in all schools and for all student subgroups, school choice increases inequality. Choice is best viewed as a subsidiary strategy to augment the effectiveness of school-level governance reform characteristics described in this paper. (30 references) (MLH)",

The guidance contained in this document is based largely on research conducted in 1987 and 1988 in schools located in Maryland and Virginia. Researchers from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) adapted radon reduction techniques proven successful in residential housing and installed them in eight schools. Results indicate that radon mitigation and diagnostic techniques developed for houses can be applied successfully in these schools. Corrective actions and costs for radon reduction will be school specific and will depend on the initial radon level; the extent of the radon problem in the school;  the school design and construction; and the design and operation of the heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system. Covered in the document are background information on radon and radon mitigation experience, important school building characteristics relative to radon entry and mitigation, problem analysis, radon diagnostic testing, and radon mitigation system design and installation.

The first section surveys descriptive and experimental research recently accumulated on classroom management practice, concentrating on strategies for monitoring and guiding classroom activity systems. Classroom activities research confirms the relationship of different activity types, classroom physical characteristics, and student choice and mobility to student (mis)behavior and the classroom management demands made on teachers. Management is a cognitive activity based on a teacher's knowledge of classroom event trajectories and the way certain actions will affect situations. Specific management skills are useless  without this basic understanding of classrooms. The second section focuses on classroom rules, procedures, and common discipline forms, particularly reprimands and other \"desists\" to keep order. Research suggests that classroom rules and procedures must be both announced and enforced, and that rule making involves complex interaction processes and negotiations of meaning. The third section examines punishment and supension's effectiveness as discipline strategies for serious classroom disruptions. Also discussed is the applicability of behavior modification procedures to classroom settings. The concluding section evaluates the state of classrooom management and discipline research and identifies implications for research and practice. (92 references) (MLH)",

        "description":"In successful schools, a significantly larger percentage of students graduate with knowledge, skills, and a positive attitude toward citizenship and work than students in other schools of comparable socioeconomic status. Using data from the &quot;Tennessee Looks at Its Schools&quot; project, which was based on fourth-grade Stanford Achievement Tests administered in May 1980 to six selected Tennessee elementary schools, this study addressed the norm-setting behavior of principals in effective schools. Behaviors collected from principals and teachers at the 6 schools were categorized into 13 ways that principals set norms. For analysis, any of the 13 categorized behaviors used by at least 4 of the principals were considered instrumental in norm-setting. A total of four norm-setting  techniques occurred and were classified as &quot;Human Relations,&quot;&quot;Resource Provider,&quot;&quot;Authority of Position,&quot; and &quot;Modeling.&quot; Of these, Resource Provider may have the most potential for principals' effectiveness. Additionally, 35 norms identified in a review of effective school literature were compiled into a checklist; the principals and teachers of the six schools were asked to check the norms they perceived were occurring in their schools. The norm groupings indicated that principals fulfilled their obligations to teachers, respected teachers' professional autonomy, and helped define high expectations for students.

Part of the significance of this report, which contains the results of the educators' deliberations including their observations and recommendations, rests on the fact that it came primarily from those who, on a daily basis, experience the reality of schools and classrooms. Focused on moving toward academic excellence, four sections discuss science, mathematics, social studies, and English, while an additional section reports on ideas for restructuring the secondary school organization and curriculum. The document  emphasizes the interdisciplinary learning and cross-disciplinary skills that point the way toward the more sensible use of student time and proposes that knowledge be comprehensively demonstrated rather than traditionally tested. Further, the report asserts that the instrument for educational change is itself a process, not just the static culmination of a process. A list of participants and numerous black and white photographs are included. (KM)",

        "description":"The junior high school, typically grades 7-8 or 7-9, offers a program that is \"not-quite-yet-but-trying-to-be\" a high school. The organization of the middle school (commonly the grades 6-8), however, is based on a philosophy of education that was specifically designed to meet the special needs of a preadolescent learner; middle schools incorporate unique curricula to better effect the transition between elementary and high school programs, rather than attempt to approximate one or the other. Many educators, perceiving junior highs as a \"failed\" promise, have turned to the middle school philosophy as an affirmation of a higher level of commitment. Indeed, since 1964, the number of new middle schools replacing traditional junior highs has progressively increased. A review of  research on middle-level education indicates that: (1) although primarily an administrative concern driven by attendance boundaries, grade level organization had little impact on middle-level students' academic achievement; and (2) the terms \"junior high school\" and \"middle school\" do not define a school's program. Additionally, the effective schools research has given rise to discriminant analyses of effective middle school variables and allowed researchers to identify those characteristics most commonly found within \"exemplary\" middle schools.

This phase, a pilot study, is designing a methodology to help researchers discriminate among the number, percentage, and types of programs offered by the various organizational patterns. The research is intended to assist policymakers confronted with implementation decisions regarding middle level programs. Report data were developed through telephone interviews; 37 schools participated, for a response rate of 92.5 percent. The middle school program components studied included personnel, curricular practices and offerings, clubs and activities, athletics, and facilities. Results showed  that the needs of children &quot;caught in the middle&quot; (&quot;transescents&quot;) must be considered in relation to studies and activity programs, the services offered, and certain intangible or &quot;hidden&quot; program elements (social interactions, teachers's implied actions, and physical environment effects). Numerous grade organization patterns have proved successful. What works in one location may not succeed in another. Only the school community can decide the &quot;best&quot; grouping. Future research should focus on program effectiveness relative to &quot;transescents'&quot; needs and to goals established by the individual school. Policymakers should explore various alternative programs and practice modifications, regardless of the grade spans adopted. (Eight references) (MLH)",

In addition to examining reform activities in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania, the research is drawn from other reports and studies on the status of reform and from conversation with national association representatives and reform leaders in other states. First an overview of the reform movement, its goals, and major accomplishments is reported. The overview identifies three themes in the current reform movement and highlights state and district action in each area. Second, state  policies on raising academic standards are examined. Included here is a discussion of the most widespread reform found in the six states studied: increased high school graduation requirements. Third, policies directed at enhancing the supply and quality of teachers are examined. Next, the fiscal side of reform, including trends in school finance during the 1980s, is reviewed, followed by a look at future steps that might be taken and the political factors likely to influence their direction.

The document describes how these changes occurred and what impact they have on the way teachers deliver education. This paper draws from interviews of Santa Fe personnel conducted in April 1987 and March 1988. The information was updated in the spring of 1989. The analysis shows that school-based management in Santa Fe has meant reducing significantly the number of district office administrators and changing the nature of teacher-principal roles. There is support for such change among teachers and parents. Teacher innovation seems to produce an atmosphere of excitement about learning and may increase the effectiveness of educational resources in producing learning.  But there is also resistance, not only because of existing hierarchies but because school-based management requires voluntary time from teachers and principals on top of already heavy demands. If, in addition, the restructuring begins shifting educational resources to at-risk pupils, the more vocal, higher-income parents may push to alter the nature and spirit of such change. (Author/SI)",

This paper explores those themes in examining state differential treatment of districts under four major headings: (1) the tensions between uniformity and differential treatment in the evolution of the state role in education policy; (2) the various forms of differential treatment; (3) new pressures leading to the use of differential treatment strategies; and (4) the effectiveness of differential treatment. The fifth, concluding section addresses implications for policy and research. It is implied that differential treatment strategies should be tailored to the purposes they are intended to  serve. Encouraging school improvement and alleviating regulatory burden may require different approaches to varied treatment, for example. In addition, continued work on educational indicators and attention to state agency resources are suggested. To understand the potential of differential treatment, it is necessary to study differential treatment at the state and local level; the personnel requirements and other costs these strategies embody; and the effects of such strategies on schools, districts, and states and the relationships among them.

Part B, providing state assistance, can play an important role in these efforts. To carry out the purpose of Part B, states must use their federal grants to make subgrants to local districts for establishing, operating, and  improving local anti-drug efforts in schools; make subgrants to, and contracts with, like-minded community-based organizations; and engage in development, training, technical assistance, and coordination activities.

        "description":"Disciplinary violations, the violations of school rules, are rightfully censured solely by school district employees. Crimes, however, represent violations of federal, state, or local laws and concern law enforcement agencies as well as school system officials. Since the mid-1970s, there has been a refining of police-school roles; interagency coordination and cooperation ranging from the local to the national level have steadily increased. This document reviews the literature regarding strategies developed between police agencies and school systems aimed at preventing, reducing, or controlling serious student misbehavior and crime. The findings indicate that there are substantial differences between the types of programs that result from police wanting to work with school systems  and school systems wanting to help police. When police agencies consider working in a school setting, either with primary or secondary school youth, the emphasis is on education. But when school district officials solicit the police for cooperative programs, the emphasis appears to be upon using the police to help with special patrols or security-related assignments. The programs examined typically did not rely on data collection and analysis for planning, guidance, and success verification with the one exception of the \"Safer Schools-Better Students\" program.

        "description":"Organizational changes, within the existing structure of public schooling, have the potential to decrease the oppositional behavior of students and to foster humane, positive learning and working enviroments. It has been documented that managers can create organizational structures that promote positive behaviors and facilitate people's willingness and ability to assume responsibility for what they do within the organization. Applied to schools, this approach assumes it is far easier to change organizational structure and culture than it is to \"fix\" the people within schools. Additionally, a structural-cultural approach attacks the sources--for most students--of oppositional behavior and thereby increases school authorities' ability to respond appropriately to the relatively few  students whose serious misbehavior demands exceptional disciplinary treatment. Thinking about school discipline as a problem of organizational structure and culture is a more useful and pragmatic approach than searching for a one-best technology or single strategy that probably does not exist. Moreover, improving discipline by altering the dominant forms of curriculum and instruction within schools--a strategy that addresses significant sources of student opposition to schooling--is likely to be a more enduring strategy than the historically bankrupt effort to end misbehavior by relying on instructional control via closer monitoring and stricter punishment.

        "description":"Schools are expected not only to conserve society's values and standards, but to be dynamic organizations with built-in mechanisms for incorporating rapid, far-reaching change. Although change is unlikely unless at least one highly motivated individual assumes the role of initial change agent, lasting change requires more than the efforts of a single person. Pat L. Cox and her colleagues found that change can be successfully implemented within a school only if it has been institutionalized at both the individual and organizational levels. Once an innovation has been initiated, the principal becomes a key player in the change process, as shown in two articles originating from a year-long study of schools where innovations had been initiated at the district level. Shirley M. Hord  and Leslie Huling-Austin found that successful program implementation hinged on the principal's actions in four support function areas. Gene E. Hall argues that successful implementation of innovation is also determined by principals' use of an &quot;initiator&quot; leadership style. Roland Vandenberghe's study of educational innovation in Belgian elementary schools corroborates Hall's leadership style thesis and suggests that proposed innovations should be made meaningful to those (primarily teachers) who must expedite the change. Finally, Kent D. Peterson views the school as a culture whose shape and direction can be powerfully influenced by the principal's action or inaction. (MLH)",

        "description":"In response to growing public concern over declining educational quality and discipline problems in today's schools, this paper reviews research on the causes of school disruption and student misbehavior, identifies promising ameliorative strategies, and examines specific research-practitioner collaborations that have successfully reduced school disorder. Schools with discipline problems lack fair, clearly stated, and firmly enforced rules and respond ambiguously to student misbehavior or ignore it. Such schools are large, located in urban areas, lack teaching resources and close teacher-administrator cooperation, and have teachers with punitive attitudes. Disruptive students generally do not attend school regularly, are low achievers with low educational expectations, have  delinquent friends, dislike school, lack belief in the validity of rules, and have little adult supervision. The risk factors for schools and individuals converge in suggesting the need for clear, fair, and consistent rule enforcement that promotes a more positive attitude toward school and the validity of rules. Bringing about beneficial school change requires an organizational development approach, as used in a national Delinquency Prevention Through Alternative Education project using a tool called Program Development Evaluation. The Effective Schools Project in Baltimore, Maryland, is an example of a successful collaborative process working toward classroom management and instructional innovations aimed at improving student outcomes. (Unfortunately, the improvement was never  institutionalized.) Other specific program models and instructional strategies are summarized, along with recommendations for further research.

Research shows that principals spend most of their time on administrative or managerial tasks. Obstacles to exercising instructional leadership may be overcome by clarifying expectations regarding the knowledge, skills, and beliefs associated with this concept. Today's knowledge base is substantial, thanks to research on effective schools, effective teaching, school improvement, and effective business organizations. Essential instructional leadership skills include envisioning,  communicating, developing trust, motivating others, decision-making, planning, and promoting collegiality. Equally important are leaders' belief systems, especially their self-concept and treatment of others. The effective principal blends knowledge, skills, and beliefs when working with teachers and parents to develop an educational philosophy that shapes decisions regarding the school's goals and objectives. The principal is also responsible for fostering a high quality staff development program, a positive school climate, and active community involvement. Principals' greatest leadership challenge will be dealing with a newly restructured teaching force with greater professional autonomy. (13 references) (MLH)",

Principals must make a special effort to know new and itinerant teachers, aides and volunteers, substitutes, and other staff. Knowing students is central to understanding a school's social system. Principals must also become familiar with evaluation and monitoring systems governing staff, curriculum and instruction, the school testing program, special programs, class assignments, discipline, faculty  meetings, parent conferences, supply distribution procedures, major school activities, money-handling methods, and policies conerning emergencies and special drills. Learning about the total school system involves understanding the district's formal organizational structure, district goals and objectives, and performance evaluation criteria; attending central office and board meetings; handling visiting VIPs; and managing personnel, the teacher union contract, and teacher evaluation and dismissal.

Although instructional supervision is a principal's most important responsibility, research indicates that building administrators spend less than 20 percent of their time in this endeavor. Principals' supervisory repsonsibilities include setting goals and objectives, deploying staff, observing teachers' instructional  techniques, knowing the formal and informal curricula, overseeing special funded programs, maintaining staff morale, and managing staff development and teacher functions. The best instructional supervision approach is a five-step clinical supervision model featuring a preconference with the teacher, lesson observation, lesson analysis, the teacher conference, and the postconference analysis. When supervising instruction, the principal must consider cetain elements fundamental to the teaching/learning process: (1) student learning outcomes; (2) teaching behaviors; (3) teaching strategies; and (4) differing levels of teacher sophistication.

This action relieved school-year principals from summer school planning and allowed a few professionals to develop a quality program. The person hired as The elementary summer school principal was given the task of designing an effective, cost-efficient summer school program, and did so in collaboration with teachers, administrators, students, and parents. Staff were guided by a nine-step action plan involving: (1) cooperative planning; (2) developing a curriculum including both  remedial and enrichment classes and field trips; (3) recruiting faculty; (4) scheduling hour-long classes for a half-day program; (5) publicizing the program; (6) registering students on a convenient Saturday and charging $25 minimum tuition; (7) streamlining program operations; (8) formatting an easily understood final report; and (9) involving teachers in program evaluation. Teachers and students benefitted from the lack of grades, the chance to build confidence and new friendships, discovery of ways to combine fun and learning, freedom from paperwork, and the short working day.

Typical school improvement and excellence initiatives do not, by themselves, constitute restructuring. Restructuring means that schools should be organized according to children's learning needs. To achieve real educational excellence for all students is likely to require significant alterations in our educational system at local, district, and state levels. Since restructuring means preserving and building upon successful educational practices and rethinking and redesigning what has failed, we must ultimately reexamine all aspects of schooling, including mission and goals, organization and management, curriculum, instruction, educator  roles and responsibilities, parent and community involvement, school finance, and educational regulation and control. Several ongoing restructuring efforts provide concrete examples--the Coalition of Essential Schools, the National Network for Educational Renewal, the NEA Mastery in Learning Project Schools, the Holmes Group, and the Carnegie Forum on Education and the economy. Critical restructuring components include focusing at the building level, educating all students, clarifying and raising expectations, personalizing teaching and learning, rethinking and altering educator roles, applying research and development knowledge, humanizing the organizational climate, and involving parents and the community.

Indicators must meet certain substantive and technical standards that define the kind of information they should provide and the features they should measure. There are two types of statistical indicators. Whereas single statistics provide readings about education (such as class size or number of schools using microcomputers), composite statistics (such as the pupil/teacher ratio) provide information concerning relationships among factors. Indicator systems measure separate components and interactions between components. Complete educational indicator systems are nonexistent. Indicators can supposedly help to: (1) report the status of American schooling and make  district, state, and international comparisons; (2) monitor changes over time; (3) explain the causes of various conditions and changes; (4) predict likely changes; (5) profile system strengths and weaknessses; and (6) suggest improvement strategies for policymakers. Some of these claims can be met, while others are unrealistic, as this report shows. Indicator data are unlikely to produce unequivocably good or bad news and will be open to various interpretations. Decisions (mostly political) about desired schooling outcomes and conditions will determine the nature of any indicator system. There are numerous implementation issues, including desired level of information, the need to make fair comparisons, appropriate scope, political pressures, and reconciliation concerning priorities among  policymakers and professional educators.

Following an introductory chapter, Chapter 2 provides a discussion of software that goes beyond drill and practice and at the same time fits easily into the existing subject areas of reading/language arts and mathematics. Chapters 3 and 4 discuss using word processing software to teach writing and using software to develop problem-solving and critical thinking skills. Numerous illustrations of effective ways that teachers have used the software are included. In Chapter 5, the topic of using software to help students learn how to be better learners is addressed. Chapters 6 and 7 deal with the interaction between student, learning environment, and software--all of which is facilitated by the  teacher. Chapter 6 focuses on the multiple roles of the teacher as introducer, technical advisor, arranger, visitor, silent partner, booster, mentor, and learner. The final section of Chapter 7 lists alphabetically all software identified in the book, with publisher, address, and computer type. (JDD)",

Children (n=47) born severely or profoundly deaf, in age groups from 7 to 15 years and all attending day classes in which the English-structured Manually Coded English (MCE) was used, were compared. Roughly half lived in deaf families where sign language (usually American Sign Language) was constantly used, while the others lived in hearing families with sporadic use of sign language (usually MCE). Reading and sign language comprehension were found to increase between the ages of 7 and 12 but not afterward. Children who used sign language constantly at home outperformed others on tests of  reading and American Sign Language (ASL) comprehension, but not MCE comprehension, suggesting that deaf children's reading comprehension is based in their language comprehension regardless of linguistic structure, as is the case with hearing children. Reading comprehension was predicted equally well by ASL and MCE comprehension. Five figures and two tables are included. (PB)",

The goal of the project was for the six participating teachers to become consistent in their role modeling of English and American Sign Language (ASL), through weekly inservice on ASL and guidance in its appropriate use. Although English was the primary language of the classroom, ASL was used as an intervention tool. The paper describes: (1) techniques used for identifying classroom situations that call for the use of ASL, (2) discourse situations that influence the use of different language codes in total communication classrooms, and (3) guidelines for code-switching between English and ASL. The paper reviews the  limited research on the effectiveness of ASL as an instructional tool, notes policy considerations, and offers a theoretical framework which sees ASL as a means of increasing deaf students' comprehension of instructional information. A variety of related issues are briefly addressed including the combined expression of signs and speech, the use of two languages in the classroom, attitudes toward ASL intervention, the conceptual function of signs, and the role of fingerspelling in instruction. 43 references.

Common suggestions in the literature include individual and/or group counseling for learning-disabled persons to increase disability self-awareness.

        "description":"In order to evaluate the most effective delivery format for providing gifted/talented education, 247 elementary students in gifted programs in Evansville, Indiana, were divided into experimental students, who received instruction in self-contained classrooms of fellow gifted students, and control students, who received instruction in a pull-out program. Pre- and post-measures (about 8 months apart) on the Developing Cognitive Abilities Test (DCAT), writing samples, collage drawings, and post-test measures for the Indiana Statewide Test of Educational Progress (ISTEP) and the California Achievement Test (CAT) measured students' progress. Results from the DCAT and the collage drawing showed highly significant differences favoring the self-contained classroom format. Analysis of the  writing samples showed some advantage for the control group. No substantive significant differences were found on the ISTEP or the CAT. Based on the number of significant differences that favored the self-contained classroom, it was concluded that this seemed to be the more effective format, but careful attention is recommended to determine how writing scores can be improved in that kind of format. It is also recommended that other delivery models, such as in-class enrichment, be considered. The major portion of the report is composed of statistical results from the assessment instruments and examples of student materials. Contains 10 references. (JDD)",

        "description":"The study investigated the effectiveness of and attitudes toward two delivery systems (an enrichment pull-out program and a self-contained classroom) for gifted/talented instruction in Southwest Allen County, Indiana. The effects on fifth-grade students (N=38) enrolled in the program and sixth-grade students (N=45) who had experienced the program 1 year prior were compared. A quantitative study compared students' performance on the Developing Cognitive Abilities Test (DCAT) and writing samples. Results indicated that, although some writing sample scores from fifth-grade students were significantly higher for students in enrichment pull-out programs, the differences did not retain their significance when scores were adjusted for differences in ability. The sixth-grade results  demonstrated that students in the self-contained classroom had significantly higher scores on the quantitative subtest and on the total DCAT when their scores were compared to the enrichment pull-out. A qualitative study involving administrators, teachers, students, and parents found that the community preference for a delivery system was influenced by the past experiences of parents, by the affinity of parents toward the neighborhood school, and by the number of gifted/talented students in the school attendance district.

        "description":"Research has shown that siblings can experience either negative or positive mental health outcomes as a result of having a brother or sister with disabilities. When maladjustment occurs, it is frequently attributed to the stress of excessive helping. This research-based paper proposes that siblings of children with disabilities, perceiving themselves as voluntarily providing moderate amounts of help, are likely to experience lower amounts of psychological distress and greater psychological well-being than siblings with different experiences within the family. A conceptual model is proposed in which helping may be associated with positive outcomes, as the sibling may derive critical benefits by alleviating emotional distress and curtailing the sense of helplessness that may result  from being a victim of stressful circumstances. In the model, three antecedents impact on the voluntary adoption of a helper role: demographic factors, personality variables, and situational factors. Research in support of the model is presented, focusing on the predisposition to help, helping behaviors, and mental health outcomes. Contains 112 references. (JDD)",

The Transition Competence Battery (TCB) is being developed as an assessment tool that will guide individual training decisions and measure overall program impact. The TCB is being designed to be appropriate for adolescents and young adults with deafness, to include content that is clearly relevant to this population, to be easy to administer and score, and to retain strong psychometric properties. Development of the TCB began when 18 professionals in the field of deafness generated a list of 27 employment competencies and 28 independent living competencies and  rated their importance and their presence in the target population. A national survey of 307 professionals then prioritized the importance of the competencies. Test items within each content domain were developed, and a pilot test was administered. Subsequent plans involve standardizing the TCB on a national sample, finalizing it, and disseminating it. (JDD)",

The Independence Group Home serves five youth with moderate retardation who also have severe behavior disorders. After 1-3 years in this home, youth are moved to foster care or other less restrictive environments. The Clackamas Group Home was established to provide a residential setting for a population of young  adults who are severely multiply handicapped. This program is working to develop electronic communication systems for the residents, a day activity program, and an emphasis on resident management of the home. The Hillsboro Group Home provides a community residence for youth who are profoundly retarded, where they can attend public school and participate in age-appropriate activities.

Findings concerning employment included that graduates' plans for employment were fairly  consistent with their actual activities and that most TMR and ER graduates are unemployed and not seeking employment. Among findings concerning independence were that almost all graduates still live in the homes of their parents or guardians and that LD and ER graduates are satisfied with their current lives.

Early litigation involving the EHA is described. A 1988 United States Supreme Court decision is traced through the district court and appeals court process. The decision, which ruled that handicapped students cannot be expelled for misconduct, at the same time upheld  the use of normal disciplinary procedures such as suspensions. The policy implications and administrative implications of this decision are discussed. Forms for use in developing disciplinary policies and procedures and for documenting the use of disciplinary procedures are attached. 18 references. (JDD)",

An interview with Darlene Ackerman, a vocational rehabilitation counselor in Virginia, is include, in which she comments on barriers to support employment, communication concerns, counselor role, funding, and feedback. The next section reports on results of a national survey of rehabilitation counselors (N=790) on supported employment which includes narrative and tabular data on the rehabilitation counselor's role, counselors' knowledge of supported employment regulations, and counselors' training needs. Other sections of the newsletter review supported employment  models (individual placements, enclaves, mobile work crew, and the small business/entrepreneurial model); monitoring and evaluating supported employment placements; emerging trends in supported employment (e.g., worker wages are below minimum for group models but are above minimum for individual placements); and advocacy for supported employment. Finally Paul Wehman of Virginia Commonwealth University answers commonly asked questions concerning supported employment (e.g., for whom should rehabilitation counselors use supported employment?).

        "description":"This study examined the extent to which federal and state funding compensates for the excess cost of educating students under Public Law 94-142, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act. The literature is supports of the contention that the high costs of educating a handicapped child were well known prior to passage of P.L. 94-142, which mandated an &quot;individualized education program&quot; (IEP) for each covered child as well as varous special education services. Requirements of the Law that all needed special education and related services be included in the IEP even when such services cannot be provided by the local education agency are discussed. The Oklahoma weighting formula which partially recompenses local districts for excess costs of educating handicapped children is  cited. The opinion of school superintendents across the state that the weights are generally too low is also noted. Actual costs of educating each category of handicapped student in Oklahoma City were compared with costs of educating the average nonhandicapped student and these costs were then compared with total revenues received per student. The results of the study are seen to provide a rationale as well as a quantitative basis for assigning more appropriate weights for each category. 14 references. (DB)",

        "description":"The monograph presents essential components of a decision making sequence used to incorporate formalized family assessment and service planning procedures into two existing early intervention programs in Massachusetts. The 1-year effort used a consultant to: (1) redefine screening and assessment processes to include both child and family centered dimensions; (2) identify and critically evaluate formalized instruments used to assess family needs and strengths; (3) develop alternative individual family service plan (IFSP) formats; and (4) develop revised intake, screening, diagnostic, and service planning processes which reflect statutory requirements, contemporary research findings, and best clinical judgement. The monograph contains six sections and appendixes. After an  introduction and overview, Part II looks at the context for family assessment and intervention including Public Law 99-457 and research findings. Methods of reviewing and analyzing family assessment instruments are presented in Part III with sections on classes of available measures and criteria for test selection. Discussed in Part IV are implications of family assessment for program organization and design. Part V considers development of an IFSP format, and Part VI briefly notes training/technical assistance implications. Seven appendices provide information on measures of social support and family behavior, significant life stressor scales, and quality of caregiving environment scales.

Characteristics of persons effective in dealing with violent or aggressive students include intelligence, positive attitudes toward students, and high expectations for students. Other personal qualities that are related in general to effective interpersonal relationships and to successful teaching include cognitive flexibility; the ability to accommodate values, insights, feelings, and perceptions different from one's own; and the ability to experience and interact comfortably with others who are different. Teachers with these qualities can restructure student behavior through discipline. The motivational behavioral approach emphasizes guidance without domination and  freedom without laxity. It stresses understanding the underlying causes of disruptive behavior and its possible precipitators, and recommends the development of a large repertoire of interventions.

Articles were then typed and organized in general categories such as world events, sports, school events, and comics, and the layout was determined. Project evaluation indicated: students learned to use the word processor in less than an hour; and the desktop publishing software encouraged students to use creativity and organizational skills. Other results were that fourth graders were more motivated and involved than sixth graders and most of the  children demonstrated a sense of ownership and intrinsic motivation.

The intervention was implemented by trained consultants who worked with parents in the home setting to achieve three goals: (1) increase students' acquisition of independent study habits; (2) promote effective parent-teacher relationships through cooperation, planning, and follow-through with assigned homework tasks; and (3) increase parental skill in providing structure and support for their child's academic work. Although comparisons of intervention and control group  subjects failed to show significant differences in students' academic responding time in classroom settings, several home and school factors that contribute to work incompletion problems often demonstrated by students with mild handicaps were identified.

Four principles of media communications are stressed: (1) children's television is an important vehicle for changing attitudes; (2) it is vital to know the audience; (3) active participation by the target audience is the goal; and (4) begin with the indigenous structures of any culture. First, development of a disability awareness component for the American television program, Sesame Street, is reviewed. Among Hong Kong activities described are: the Festival of Arts with the Disabled, the International Arts Symposium, cable television, the Television Magazine format series, and the Children's Media Workshop. Indian programs described  include: a workshop with the Central Institute for Educational Technology; a workshop on Childhood Disability; and a UNICEF consultancy. Activities in Pakistan include production of public service announcements, a photography project, a Workshop on Media and People with Disabilities, and an in-house UNICEF workshop on children and the media. Commentaries on the manual are provided by Robert Ruffner, formerly with the President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities, Louise Duval of the Department of Anthropology and Sociology of Fordham University, and Sandra Gordon of the National Easter Seal Society.

A chapter titled \"The Vocational Training Continuum\" presents the theoretical basis for developing a continuum of vocational experiences needed by the autistic learner. It describes existing vocational training models for the severely handicapped, issues and questions emerging from these models, and the vocational training continuum developed by the Transitional Autism Program at Indiana University's Developmental Training Center. \"Vocational Assessment\" reviews types of information needed in the assessment process, describes methods of obtaining assessment information, and provides a model for ongoing assessment tied to  vocational programming phases. \"Teaching Entry Level Vocational Behaviors: Identifying Individual Objectives\" focuses on establishing appropriate objectives in the areas of communication, endurance/continuous working, compliance, interpersonal behavior, rate, and accuracy. \"Teaching Entry Level Vocational Behaviors: Manipulating Instructional Variables\" uses instructional variables as a means to teach flexibility and independence within the context of work behaviors. Specific manipulations of environment, structure/routine/schedule, materials, and expectations/reinforcement are examined. Appendices contain a summary of formal assessment instruments, student profile database forms, vocational assessment summary, sample individual educational plans, and sample behavior plans. 25 references.

Small group discussions focused on determination of the extent to which children and youth with handicaps are at risk for HIV infection, identification of the most appropriate curricular delivery approaches to meeting the HIV/AIDS prevention education needs of children and youth with handicaps, and determination of the extent and methods by which prevention education needs of this population currently are being met. Conclusions and recommendations in the areas of policy, training, curriculum, and instruction are presented. A list of forum participants and a list of 25 suggested readings conclude the report.

Difficulties in performing basic functional skills were identified in about half of the students. Average student IQ was 87. LD students were more likely than others to come from economically disadvantaged households. Students spent an average of 64% of instructional time in regular education classes suggesting that the regular education initiative has limited potential in increasing the mainstreaming of these students at the secondary level. Students were more likely to be mainstreamed for nonacademic or  vocational courses than for academic classes. Most LD students were held to the same grading standard as nondisabled students in regular education classes, and generally were not provided direct services (beyond their special education classes) such as tutoring assistance. Neither were regular education teachers provided with substantial direct support for instruction of these students. Grade failure and subsequent dropping out were positively correlated with amount of time spent in regular education classes, independent of student ability level, IQ, or demographic characteristics.

Transcripts of four video tests used for an elementary French program, representing the range of topics that can be covered and the variety of testing activities that can be generated, are presented. For each transcript, the target listening skill is specified, the interaction is transcribed, a number of testing options are described, and considerations in  using the video are discussed, including its advantages for certain stages of learning and use of print materials in conjunction with the video.

One of three participating classes was instructed in the use of a monolingual learner's dictionary. A passage correction test administered before and after the instruction was used to assess instructional effectiveness. The amount and type of dictionary use on the course's final exam measured whether the instruction led to greater use of monolingual dictionaries. Results showed significant improvement on the passage correction test for the class receiving instruction in dictionary use, but none for the other classes. Also, the same class used monolingual  dictionaries much more on the final exam. (MSE)",

Program evaluation showed the following results: staff development was effective in helping teachers  implement instructional activities; concurrent instruction decreased from 33% to 3% after one year, in comparison with 29% at other schools; academic gains are likely to be gradual, becoming apparent after 3-5 years; former LEP students transitioned into mainstream instruction (reclassified as fluent English proficient or FEP) outperformed counterparts at other schools in reading and math; project teachers and parents were more satisfied than others with the instructional program; and reclassified FEP students had the highest self-esteem scores of all language classification students at any school.

The attributive numeral phrase occupies the position of a modifier and is a complement to N or N'. The quantifier (partitive) numeral phrase is the head of its phrase and the NP is a complement to it. While both types of numeral phrases may occur to the right of a position, their distribution is constrained by different factors. The numeral quantifier must have as its complement a non-quantified, definite NP. These conditions being met, it may appear to the right of any postposition. On the other hand, numeral modifiers are simple modifiers of the head noun and not  affected by the definiteness or quantification of the entire phrase. Their appearance to the right of postpositions is, however, constrained syntactically. Specifically, they may only move out of surface subjects and direct objects. (MSE)",

Recent research in Ireland suggests a student-perceived need for instruction in grammar that, in combination with authentic materials and other kinds of information about the language, can substantially advance language learning. The proposed solution is a text exploitation kit, available to teachers and learners, with detailed, step-by-step instructions for creating didactic materials from authentic texts. Such a manual would have three sections: the first non-language-specific, dealing with learning in general and language learning in particular and offering a number of strategies for  promoting more effective learning; the second language-specific and containing reference material relating to the language system in question and its principal sociocultural contexts of usage; and the third language-specific but constructed of a battery of text-exploitation &quot;recipes&quot; designed to mediate between the manual's first and second sections and authentic texts.

Code-switching is simply a recognition of the fact that more than one language can define events and persons. Not all forms of code-switching are regarded as acceptable in the bilingual classroom. Language alternation in bilingual classrooms must be meaningful in itself and not simply reflect a language choice. A teacher who is bilingual has intuitive knowledge of bilingual behavior that can be instrumental in constructing a sociolinguistic profile of the student in the bilingual classroom. With this knowledge, the teacher can determine (1) what is being switched and how it is being switched; (2) whether a student is mixing or alternating languages in a  manner that communicates confusion; and (3) criteria for separating meaningful from meaningless code-switching. Based on these discoveries, the teacher can structure classroom behavior more effectively. (MSE)",

Parent training models, some created specifically for use with language minority parents, have not resulted in increased parent involvement or continuity of involvement. A review of literature revealed almost 100 training topics that field practitioners and other specialists have identified as areas of need. These topics were consolidated into 75 items divided almost evenly among the 3 categories of skills, knowledge, and attitudes. A pilot survey using these items was administered to chairpersons of parent advisory committees serving bilingual education programs in a  five-state region. A second, more general study was developed using those results and administered to 300 parents representing 30 basic bilingual education programs. Parents responding to the pilot survey were more specific in their choice of skill areas than the general survey respondents, who thought all items were important and interrelated. Some differences among parent preferences were found to be related to sex, age, and state of residence, but little difference was found in relation to family size, educational attainment, language preference, or occupation.(MSE)",

Long-range implications for the linguistic state of the societies and the degree of mutual versus unidirectional influences of the languages are outlined. It is concluded that while the aim of the language policies and practices in both countries is the social integration of  members of ethnic groups heretofore at least partially socially disenfranchised, the differences between the countries, growing from attitudes toward bilingualism and monolingualism in the socially dominant group, reveal what each society feels is required to achieve integration.

Concerns about inefficient program coordination, imbalances in attention paid to different world regions and languages, and limited or static funding are expressed frequently.

Illustrations are drawn from Racine's seventeenth-century classical tragedy \"Andromaque.\" Five individual and group activities are described that are referred to as the Circle, the Interpreter, the Prompter, the Matchbox, and Human Geometry. The Circle begins as the collective exploration of a text, with the group gradually increasing its intellectual and linguistic mastery of the text. The exercise concludes with students contributing different interpretations of phrases or passages. In the Interpreter, one student reads a passage and another interprets it to the first student. The Prompter requires that some students prompt other  students in performance for an imaginary audience. The latter two exercises facilitate mastery of syntactically difficult material. The Matchbox begins with the emptying of a matchbox onto the classroom floor or a table, then breaking a syntactically complex passage into as many units as is reasonable. At the end of each unit, a match is returned to the box. This activity helps students forget the complexity of a passage and focus on manageable units that reveal its basic structure. In Human Geometry, students and/or instructor choreograph intricate passages. (MSE)",

The three major types of language change discussed are spontaneous change, borrowing, and imposition. Upon analysis, it is concluded that these three types of change adequately incorporate all the analytical distinctions examined, and that the model allows comparison of a variety of characteristics associated with the change types and the making of testable predictions for particular situations. The ramifications are seen as potentially far-reaching, although much additional work is needed. It is proposed that clear and systematic treatment of change types makes possible more precise statements of the  domains and conditions under which the laws of historical linguistics apply, and may suggest principled explanations of why they take the forms they do. Finally, the model is seen to aid in keeping diachronic linguistics rooted in social history. (MSE)",

The report is in three sections. The first section is a statement, in list form, of what workshop participants agreed represents components of their philosophy on teaching and learning. The second lists and defines the classroom strategies that seem to fit the philosophy best, and, where possible, offers brief examples of how these approaches have worked or might work in the classroom. The classroom strategies include student-centered and writing-to-learn approaches, collaborative approaches, and interview  techniques. The third section offers sample lessons and projects designed by participating teachers, individually or collaboratively, and implemented based on workshop readings, writings, and discussions. Projects are listed under the following headings: GED units on the Constitution, on developing questions that motivate, on research journals for home care workers, and on activating background knowledge in geometry; Spanish GED units on reading, writing, and oral history, and on writing and publishing poetry; a GED unit on math; an ABE unit on using the newspaper to explore life and work in New York City; and an ESL unit on developing writing skills and union participation through oral history.

Of the student's stories, some are in her original words, some are corrected by her, and some are rewritten by the teacher. Each story is accompanied by a brief preface, a picture, and some suggested literacy activities.

        "description":"This review of the literature on performance appraisal for college and university faculty was undertaken to serve the ultimate goal of improving student cognitive learning. The starting point was to ask what is known about performance appraisal. What are its positive and negative consequences? How does the manner in which it is conducted relate to future performance? In what ways do the skills of the appraiser affect the outcomes? To what degree can what is accepted about performance appraisal in other settings be expected to be true for faculty and department chairs in colleges and universities? These and other questions directed the investigation. The review contains five sections and begins with a brief exposition of the principal theories that underlie performance appraisal  research in Section I. Section II examines the research studies conducted in the field or in the laboratory to test hypotheses drawn from the theories. The research is principally in the psychological and organizational fields with few contributions from postsecondary education. Section II ends with 15 general conclusions, \"truths\" that postsecondary education needs to take into consideration to improve its performance and more closely achieve its goals. Section III describes the norms, values, structures, and practices that characterize colleges and universities so that the application of the findings can be inferred as to their likelihood of successful outcomes in postsecondary institutions. Following this, a plan for performance appraisal well suited for colleges and universities is  advanced in Section IV and the conditions under which it could be successful are discussed in Section V. The list of cited references, an appendix, and a bibliography complete the monograph. The appendix briefly identifies the main appraisal procedures currently in practice in business. (AA)",

        "description":"To discover how courses are planned and taught, faculty and their students at three community colleges, two liberal arts colleges, two comprehensive universities, and one doctoral university were interviewed with a protocol based on current theories of course design. Their candid responses indicate that academic content, materials, student characteristics, and faculty beliefs are the strongest influences on course planning. Nine chapters provide the following information: (1) background; (2) study purposes; (3) guiding models for the study; (4) study method; (5) overview of study results; (6) special topics of current interest (curricular issues, faculty perceptions of students and their learning needs, and faculty and student interaction); (7) results of student interviews; (8)  how course designs are expressed in syllabi; and (9) summaries, implications, and next steps. It is concluded that course level planning strategies are important in student learning; that more specific focus is needed on the effect of clarity of plans on student learning, and this model can be used to approach improvement of course planning from many vantage points. Seven appendices provide: the faculty interview protocol; the student on the effect of clarity of plans on student learning; and that this model can be used to interview protocol; student experimental questionnaires; syllabus checklist; profiles of each of the eight fictionally named cooperating institutions; an outline of exploratory regression variables; and a coding sheet for determining levels of course planning.

Big-time athletics have become an increasingly important element within American colleges and universities, and at times they appear to overshadow academics in higher education.

The purpose of the hearings was to enlighten members of Congress, and through them the general public, as to what happens in practice (how student  athletes are governed, the role of the media in creating pressures, and how students are recruited). Statements are presented from Subcommittee Chairman Pat Williams; Subcommittee members E. Thomas Coleman, George Miller, and Thomas J.

The literature on a conceptual explanation of leadership is reviewed and related directly to higher education and its sociological and organizational uniqueness. The first four of the report's five sections discuss the following topics and subtopics: (1) the contemporary context and calls for leadership (constraints in responding to the calls for leadership and overcoming constraints to leadership); (2) conceptual explanations of leadership (theories and models of leadership and organizational theory and images of leadership); (3) higher education and leadership theory (trait theories, power and influence theories,  behavioral theories, contingency theories, cultural and symbolic theories, and cognitive theories); and (4) higher education and organizational theory (the university as bureaucracy--the structural frame, the university as collegium--the human resource frame, the university as political system--the political frame, the University as organized anarchy--the symbolic frame, the university as cybernetic system, and an integrated perspective of leadership in higher education). The fifth and final section, Overview and Integration, discusses the effectiveness of leadership, cognitive complexity, transformational and transactional leadership, leadership paradigms, thinking about leadership, and an agenda for research on leadership in higher education.

Preparations can be made now to provide opportunities for minority students to enter graduate school and be prepared for a future career in the professoriate. Necessary issues and actions are defined. The first four of the reports discuss the following topics and subtopics: (1) overview of affirmative action for African-American and Hispanic faculty (why it is important to have a diverse faculty, higher education before affirmative action, defining affirmative action, and the impact of affirmative action  on higher education); (2) supply and demand for African-American and Hispanic faculty (status of this faculty in higher education, supply and demand issues, quality of faculty life, tomorrow's professoriate: the empty pipeline, and barriers to equal access and effective affirmative action); (3) effective affirmative action, institutional approaches and barriers (including institutional leadership, search committees, affirmative action offices, and case study--the African-American presence at Antioch College); and (4) national responses to affirmative action issues in higher education (court decisions, governmental agencies, public commissions, and professional organizations).

        "description":"This report, the second in a series on student financial aid, examines the effects of changes in the design of the Pell Grant Program on applicant eligibility over the 16 years between 1973-74 and 1988-89. The study is an outgrowth of a project undertaken in 1983-84 which attempted to identify the many decisions that constituted the design of each year's Pell Grant Program. The report's three main sections discuss the following topics and subtopics: (1) effects of changes on Pell Grant eligibility (presenting four dependent cases and four independent cases); (2) eligibility design components of the Pell Grant program (classes of eligible applicants, student aid index formula, allowable college costs, and payment schedule); and (3) implications for applicant eligibility (dependent  gainers, and independent gainers and losers. It is concluded that, during the 16-year life span of the Pell Grant Program, Congress has shifted the focus of Pell Grants away from lowest resource aid applicants toward applicants from more middle income backgrounds, and this shifting focus will continue in the 1988-89 award year. Applicants whose income and assets produced the highest eligibility for Pell Grants have seen the maximum Pell Grant increase by 50% since 1975-76. During this same time period, the college costs they faced increased about 150%. Pell Grants have lost purchasing power since 1975-76 for six of the eight Pell applicant cases examined in this study.

        "description":"This document, the third in a series of research reports on student financial aid, examines attitudes of Americans toward borrowing to finance educational expenses between 1959 and 1983. The impetus for the study was interest in the effects of the Federal Government's shift in student aid emphasis from grants to loans during this period. The study analyzed data from surveys of consumer finances previously collected for the Federal Reserve System. Findings indicated that Americans express a high degree of willingness to borrow to finance educational expenses with educational loans consistently viewed favorably by 70% to 80% of the population over the 24-year period. Groups less favorably inclined to borrow to finance educational expenses include women, older persons, the less  educated, those with low household income, and Hispanics. Possible implications for public policy include attempting to change attitudes about borrowing among groups reluctant to finance attendance costs through loans, improving existing programs of grants, or developing additional alternatives to loans that are more acceptable to aid applicants. Data are presented in both narrative and graphic forms. Tables are appended. Contains 22 references. (SM)",

        "description":"This document, the fourth in a series of student financial aid research reports, focuses on need analysis in student financial aid. Nearly all of the family contribution expected by the analysis of ability to pay is produced by family income, and the Congressional Methodology implemented for the 1988-89 academic year places even greater emphasis on income and less on assets than did the Uniform Methodology which it replaced. Student financial aid policy, funding, and administration are affected by growth in the proportion of poor families in the population during the last two decades. A growing proportion of financial aid applicants and college freshmen are poor. Increasingly, the poorest college students are concentrated in public two-year colleges with very few attending public  and private universities during the last decade. Matching of the family income profile against college attendance costs through need analysis finds that more than four out of five children would require financial assistance to be able to attend college today, even the least costly college, with less than 1 in 10 able to attend an average cost private college without financial aid. Results are detailed in narrative, graphic, and tabular form in sections on the following topics: (1) family income, (2) impact of the family income shift on aid applicants, (3) college enrollment shifts by family income, and (4) college attendance costs and expected family contribution.

The three studies involved description, verification, and simulation, respectively. The description study examined ACT Assessment and Family Financial Statement (FFS) records and concluded that differences exist between those who identify themselves or their parents as either dislocated workers or displaced homemakers and other FFS filers. Displaced homemaker applicants or their dependents reported notably lower incomes and often no home equity. The verification study found that only about a third of survey respondents provided  convincing responses confirming their status as dislocated workers or displaced homemakers, suggesting that they were not eligible to claim special formula treatment under the Congressional Methodology of need analysis. The simulation study compared the effects on expected family contributions of the special formula treatments for income and home equity. For well over half of both dislocated workers and displaced homemaker applicants, the special treatment did not affect expected family contributions by more than $100. For the remainder, the special formula treatment usually reduced expected family contributions. The result was that applicants were qualified for higher levels of student financial aid, with those from higher family incomes more likely to benefit from the special treatment  formula.

The inservice component is an annual program consisting of at least six colloquia during the school year designed to keep principals enthusiastic and motivated, with ideas for improving their schools' instructional programs. The project's research component explores the program's impact, makes  suggestions for improvement, and seeks to generalize findings for application to standard administrative preparation programs. The initial interim evaluation report using both opinions of interns and their supervisors and objective measures found that the Meadows Program appears to be successful and superior to the regular East Texas State University program in every aspect measured.

Follow-up visits to the teachers who used the demonstrations revealed that some teachers needed both extensive help with the experiments and a broader conceptual base. The project continues by Lamar University with the addition of demonstrations to the lending library and increased school participation. A primary project focus is the  establishment of communication with pre-college teachers in need of help but reluctant to seek it.

Initial federal support permitted development of a centralized, all-campus support and administrative structure while leaving intern supervision (sponsorship) with the teaching faculty in the departments. Interns have a formal learning contract and internship handbook. The centralized internship office acts as a quality control agent, student advisor, and communication link. College policy governing internships emphasizes the crucial role of the teaching faculty as sponsors in placing, evaluating, and assessing the internships. One issue of concern in the program is  the lack of a systematic, college-wide scheme for compensating sponsors, so the total real cost of the program is obscured. Attempts to link compensation with faculty development are under way as a means of guaranteeing that academic standards are maintained. (MSE)",

A curriculum development team consisting of junior high school physical science students and teachers and university educators produced a seven-part videotape series entitled &quot;The Hypothesizers.&quot; Rather than emphasize science content, activities were designed to motivate and to engage students in anticipating, analyzing, hypothesizing, writing, discussing, and testing science-related problems and solutions. Two experimental and two control groups of ninth-grade students, totalling 341 subjects, participated in a pretest-stimulus-posttest trial of the materials. Data were collected using a specially-designed high school course  interest inventory. For physics, all students using the materials reported a significantly greater interest increase than students receiving no stimulus or a placebo. For chemistry, one of the two experimental groups reported a significant interest increase. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"The Children's Lab at Northern State University (South Dakota) is a science concept development laboratory for use by students in a physical science course for preservice elementary teachers. Its function is to develop science content knowledge in preservice elementary teachers, with the ultimate goal of developing science literacy in children. The theoretical and philosophical bases for the laboratory include (1) the idea that science can be understood only by tracing the history of ideas; (2) work on the structure of scientific knowledge; (3) knowledge of the nature of language and verification; (4) research on developing units of instruction; (5) study of the dynamics of learning and teaching; and (6) work on school science education. The British Museum of Natural History's  Hall of Evolution, which traces concept development from simplest beginnings to ultimate implications, inspired this approach. The Children's Lab contains a number of units, each consisting of a series of learning stations at which elementary school teachers are trained to micro-teach about the development of a scientific principle. Students learn meaningful ideas and see how they originated, and are interrelated and applied. The program has been found to be effective, and has the potential for further development for special populations and classroom application. Appended are a discussion of the theoretical underpinnings of the Lab and data from a comparative study of two science curricula. 14 references. (MSE)",

The institute provided an opportunity for high school teachers inadequately trained in this area to become more confident in teacher Chaucer, and revitalized the enthusiasm of teachers who have already taught Chaucer by suggesting new methods and acquainting them with important scholars in the field. An intensive program of daily discussion sessions on individual tales and daily lectures and workshops conducted by project directors or major guest speakers was conducted by two university professors who are Chaucer specialists and one highly  experienced high school English teacher. Guest speakers included four of America's top Chaucerian scholars. Additional program outcomes will include a follow-up conference, a newsletter, and a book of participants' papers. The report contains the institute schedule, lists of readings, brief biographical notes of the staff, and a summary of activities.

The pre teacher assessment provides students with detailed information about potential teaching strengths and weaknesses and helps remediate deficiencies before college graduation. The center uses four simulation activities that can be administered to 12 to 60 participants during a one-and-a-half-day period. During the actual assessment, trained assessors observe students, score responses, and rate overall performance. At the conclusion, students are given a report of their score for each teaching skill. Skills assessed include problem analysis, strategic decision-making, tactical  decision-making, written communication, leadership, stress tolerance, planning and organizing, oral communication, oral presentation, sensitivity, innovativeness, initiative, and monitoring. Following assessment, students are given the opportunity to use followup training modules to remediate weaknesses. Three modules addressing the dimensions of leadership, innovativeness, and sensitivity are currently available. (MSE)",

In 1985, 20 teachers participated in a National Science Foundation summer institute. The first 2 weeks were devoted to training in mathematics and science content and teaching techniques. Lectures, demonstrations, and discussions emphasized problem-solving, classroom computer use, discovery techniques, the importance of proof, laboratory techniques, and encouragement of research by students and teachers. During  the third week, participants were able to test these concepts and techniques by working with students in the college's annual junior high school math and science camp. Teacher self-evaluation of teaching skills at the beginning and end of the 3-week program showed higher ratings in each of six skill areas upon program completion. Participant ratings of the program were high. In a survey after one semester back in the classroom, each participant described at least five new classroom and professional activities initiated because of experiences at the summer institute. Administrators also attributed increased teacher effectiveness to program participation. (MSE)",

The approach presented concepts structured so they were chronologically congruent with the natural and historical discovery of scientific concepts. Within subject areas conceptual development was initiated using concrete or experiential encounters. Teachers developed presentations that modeled concept formation, presented a series of related problems, and developed solutions cooperatively with students. Formative evaluation of the program involved analysis of scores on periodic  exams and pre- and post-tests. Summative statistical evaluations compared the numbers of &quot;successful&quot; and &quot;unsuccessful&quot; students from previous classes with those participating in the project. Reorganization of the introductory curriculum reduced the rate of &quot;unsuccessful&quot; students substantially and improved student attitudes. Contains 43 references. (MSE)",

One coordinator/faculty member and a second faculty member staffed each of the programs, and  14 guest lecturers made presentations. Other staff fluent in the two languages were hired for support positions. The 4-week programs were followed by a 1-day workshop in the fall.

The program was developed by college faculty and is under the aegis of the faculty's cultural affairs committee. Since the program's inauguration, significant changes include inclusion of debates on controversial issues, addition of optional trips to New York City, improved advance publicity about upcoming events development of a two-credit  colloquium on Soundings events, incorporation of several special events into the freshman orientation program, and creation of a quarter-time faculty position as program coordinator. While initially controversial among some faculty, the program has gained wide acceptance and support.

It delivers career interest testing and counseling to adults working in targeted local industries, with industry cooperation. While concerted recruitment does not occur at the interest testing sessions, an admission staff representative is available to observe the level of interest of participants for followup and to make personal contact. Career exploration and occupational goal-setting are made available after the interest assessment. The program is offered as a service to the community but has brought additional benefits to the university, including the attention of area  employers, contacts with employers who may later be of assistance in placing graduates, increased nontraditional student applicants, and media exposure. During the program's first two years, 17% of the individuals who completed the interest assessment matriculated at the university. (MSE)",

The humanities program has no faculty of its own, but draws instructors from existing departments throughout the university. Growth of the program has brought diversification of participating faculty. The project sought to increase program coherence by increasing faculty understanding of the program as a whole and the individual courses in it, by increasing unity and community among the staff, and by preparing staff better for their teaching assignments through (1) a year-long faculty development seminar in the humanities and (2) semester-long faculty internships in humanities courses the faculty members  had not previously taught. Funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities allowed faculty reassignment to the internship and seminar, permitted payments to seminar leaders, and purchased reading material for the seminar. A total of 37 faculty members from 17 departments participated in the faculty development seminar, and 20 faculty from 12 departments interned in 1 of the 4 humanities courses. There was some overlap between these groups. (Author/MSE)",

Activities addressed four objectives: (1) to determine the dollar value, quantity, and source of the different component parts, materials, supplies, technical design services, equipment and repair services, transportation service, brokerage, and other services purchased by plants operating in the Mexican border area; (2) to determine the potential that South Texas manufacturers, wholesalers, and service companies from Brownsville to Laredo have for supplying maquiladoras with parts, materials, and services and the problems to be  overcome in becoming suppliers; (3) to develop a computerized database for matching South Texas manufacturers with maquiladoras; and (4) to determine the general feasibility of establishing one or more business incubators to assist development of a South Texas maquiladora supply industry. Based on results of the study, it was recommended that a task force of representatives from the South Texas manufacturing community and the maquiladora industry, community leaders, public officials, educational leaders, and state and federal agency officials be established to develop and support six specific initiatives for information gathering and dissemination, coordination, and direct technical assistance.

The program has attracted 30 faculty members from 24 disciplines. The approach taken involves four central elements: (1) a faculty ethics seminar; (2) introduction of topics into existing courses and development of new courses; (3) working with practitioners to develop case studies as the focus of classroom activity; and (4) development of an all-university seminar to provide more advanced work and bring together professionals from a variety of areas to consider the common nature of  ethical dilemmas. These elements have been successful in preparing faculty from professional disciplines to integrate ethics into traditional courses, developing realistic case studies that have stimulated student interest in professional ethics, and developing an action-oriented, ethical analysis strategy for students to follow in confronting ethical dilemmas. The approach may represent a new model for integrating professional and liberal arts education, one in which introductory exposure is provided in the context of professional training and followed up by an in-depth exploration in a traditional liberal arts course.

Its first year was devoted to adapting effective teaching techniques and methods to the specific objectives identified by the school district and to producing instructional kits and written information for teachers. Design and production were carried out by a team of school district teachers and a university science educator. Many district teachers were included in field trials and material evaluation to encourage them to commit to the  project's goals and to ensure conformity to local needs. The project's second year was devoted to in-service training of all 125 teachers. District science mentor teachers provided three days of inservice training on the appropriate use of the instructional materials for all district teachers. Follow-up evaluation shows the project helped establish a uniform core science curriculum for the district. Teachers regarded the fact that the materials were developed by local colleagues as the most important factor in teachers' acceptance of the project. (Author/MSE)",

It was found that the level of teacher preparation was poor, and participants lacked basic knowledge of observations and measurements. A  positive attitude toward physics and favorable administrative policy toward science are seen to be as essential as mastery of subject matter. It is recommended that: (1) there be a substantial increase in equipment for basic measurements; (2) middle school principals should have a better and different science background; (3) the state should require a year of conceptual physics for middle school teachers; and (4) a survey of teachers in different parts of the country should be undertaken to examine possible differences between male and female science teachers.

        "description":"Recognizing the need for a strong family housing program to support a student body composed of many nontraditional students, Texas Woman's University converted a traditional residence hall into a family housing unit with an after-school and summer recreation program. The majority of residents in family housing are single mothers with children who juggle the roles of parent, student, and sole breadwinner. Some are recently divorced and/or have come from a situation in which there was abuse. Through student internships and other university and community resources, the student residents and families benefit from a support system that would be impossible to provide outside the university. Convenient to classes and supported by academic components, the family housing program provides  an environment in which students are able to fulfill their multiple roles. Program success is evident from the residence waiting list. Appended materials include brochures and newspaper articles about the residence program. (Author/MSE)",

The first hypothesis is that many administrators feel faculty research is a partner to faculty teaching effectiveness, and thus, if master teaching is the goal, faculty must excel at research. The second hypothesis is that the institution needs academic visibility, and most administrators feel research sets standards and produces role models for colleges that seek preeminence. Both hypotheses indicate a certain amount of pressure and tension between administration and faculty. Ways in which lack of research and publication affect tenure and promotion are discussed, noting the decline in the granting of tenure. More questions  about the future of small college faculty are posed, examining research that says small college faculty are being asked to do more research than in the past, and that the end result of the teaching/research struggle may hurt college students more than anyone else. Small college faculty are challenged to think about what is truly important in teaching and research. Contains 16 references. (SM)",

The policy statement addresses the general allocation of authority in the governance of athletics, emphasizing the obligation of the faculty in ensuring academic primacy in an institution's athletics programs. A section on general principles identifies the following: the importance of full disclosure of information about the athletic program, the primacy of faculty responsibility for the athlete's educational experience, the faculty's role in policymaking in other aspects of the athletic program, and the institution's relationship with outside  regulatory bodies. Suggested mechanisms for faculty participation include oversight of the educational experiences of athletes, institutional policy-making on athletics, and policy-making by outside bodies. The conclusion stresses that the faculty authority to establish and maintain general academic standards entails faculty responsibility to assure specific application of these standards to student athletes. A dissenting opinion encouraging the appointment by the American Association of University Professors of a committee to prepare suggestions for fundamental reform is attached. (SM)",

Results indicated: those who accepted admission had a lower mean rating of the friendliness of the admissions staff than did those who declined admission; there was a statistically significant interaction between  acceptance status and residence; there was a higher percentage of acceptors who indicated their experiences with the UMCP Admissions Office in any way led to their decision to attend UMCP than of decliners; and a larger percentage of blacks than whites indicated that their experiences with the UMCP Admissions Office affected their decision to attend or not attend UMCP.

According to Beauchamp, theories have three functions: to describe what is going on, help predict what will happen in given situations, and explain things that have already occurred. Beauchamp's four levels of theories are: categories of theories; theories in the applied areas of knowledge; subtheories in applied areas; and sublevels to the theories within the applied areas. The Course Development Model ties curriculum and instruction together and is based on Beauchamp's ideas concerning curriculum theory. It states that  faculty should use course descriptions contained in college/university catalogues to develop their course objectives. From course objectives, they should develop their tests based on a taxonomy of educational objectives to ensure that materials being evaluated are being done using the correct instrument.

For faculty, it offers a vehicle for expanding their knowledge, improving teaching techniques, experimenting, and developing greater collegiality. The curriculum is intended to provide students with a connected view, starting with individual concerns and moving to larger social groups and ultimately the world community. NCL predates the national reform movement, using many components to achieve its goals (integrated curriculum, interdisciplinary in all courses, team-teaching, creative teaching strategies, and careful selection of faculty).  The program consists of 12 3-hour courses (e.g., Self, Theories of Human Nature, American Character, Society and Values, Science and Society, and The Global Village). The NCL contribution to ETSU's goals include: financial stability (through improved student retention, recruitment and marketing potential, and revenue neutrality); faculty development; and educational excellence.

It is based primarily on data made available by the professional associations of the schools and practitioners. Applicants in recent years are compared with those in earlier years to determine the extent to which the pool has changed with regard to racial/ethnic composition, gender composition, socioeconomic status of the applicants, and academic qualifications of the applicants. Trends in higher education that may be associated with some of the changes that have occurred in the health professions applicant pool are presented. Some  of the findings are as follows: a general decline in applicant numbers; a decline in white male applicants and an increase in female applicants; recent applicants appear to be more affluent than applicants in earlier years; in most disciplines, declines in the applicant pool have been accompanied by a larger percentage of applicants accepted; and increasing undergraduate enrollments have not necessarily led to increased number of health professions schools applicants.

        "description":"In 1988, Harvard University unveiled plans for Medical Science Partners (MSP), a venture capital fund intended to invest in and commercialize faculty biomedical projects. Critical of what is perceived as a &quot;15 year long trend&quot; wherein Harvard has &quot;forged deeper and more extensive ties with the biomedical industry,&quot; the document asserts that MSP will give Harvard a role and interest in the marketing of its faculty's research plus a vested interest in the health of the biomedical industry. Most of the fund will be for facilitating patenting, federal approval, commercial development, and marketing, with little monies going into laboratory research. Unlike the Ptashne case of 1980 squelched by President Bok as an &quot;improper relationship,&quot; the MSP plan does not give Harvard equity in  companies that result from its faculty's research. However, the authors argue against the MSP as currently conceived, addressing issues of structure; investors and investments; and patents, licenses, and profits. Six recommendations are proffered: the university must directly address the issues raised by the Ptashne case before embracing the MSP; the university must demonstrate the value and worthiness of the arrangement on its own terms; Harvard must demonstrate that any research project taken on by MSP falls into the development gap; the internal documents of the Academic Review Committee and Board of Directors of ION, Inc. should be made public; restructure the MSP proposal so it receives none of the partnership's profits; and no MSP funds should be invested in non-Harvard ventures.

Harvard scholars were found to maintain 38 directorships with Fortune 500 companies, 60 ties to the biotechnology industry, over 500 contacts between faculty at the Business School and corporate America, and over 50 slots on federal advisory committees. Because of the secrecy surrounding scholars' outside activities, this information is considered to be only the surface of academic moonlighting. Examples are provided of the ways in which extensive outside relationships lead to conflicts of commitment and direct and indirect conflicts of interest. In addition, examples are provided of corporate attempts to coopt  academics by employing them as consultants or directors.

Eighteen recommendations for changes in Harvard's governing system are proposed, involving more openness on the part of the corporation and increased student involvement in governance. Appendices include a description of university governance, edited by university officials; short profiles of members of the Harvard Corporation; the author's correspondence with the Harvard Corporation; an interview with the university treasurer and the vice president for government, community, and public affairs; and a  list of the universities and colleges surveyed concerning their governing structure.

This study speculates on several perceptual and aesthetic drawbacks of future massive applications of three dimensional (3-D) video images. Specifically it: (1) reviews the technology of existing 3-D media; (2) discusses the principles of visual perception and aesthetics which are challenged by the development of 3-D media technology in television; and (3) provides alternatives to the problems raised by massive application and commercializing of 3-D media technology. It is concluded that the novelty generated by 3-D media  technology challenges the fundamental rules of perception and aesthetic appreciation of film and television images, but that neurophysiological bases of the visual perception processes and psychological standards of aesthetic appreciation have strong roots and traditions, and will not easily be bypassed by 3-D media technology.

        "description":"Converting research findings into practical applications is an important concept to education but one that has been overlooked by the educational research community until recently. While a model for turning concepts into practical applications has been developed and field tested for human service practitioners, the model has not been directly applied in education. It appears that social science researchers have not put the resources into disseminating their research that they have put into the research effort itself. A recently proposed solution is &quot;social marketing,&quot; a conceptual system for thinking through the change process which places a high priority on identifying the needs, perceptions, preferences, reference groups, and behavioral patterns of audiences, and tailoring  innovations to best suit audience characteristics. This paper describes an application of social marketing concepts to the education dissemination process, outlining the tasks performed during the needs assessment phase, the research and development phase, the dissemination phase, and the utilization profit phase. A comparison between business and industrial marketing and social marketing is drawn and further analyzed within the framework of the four basic component marketing fields: (1) product; (2) promotion; (3) place; and (4) price. It is noted that the model has been field tested in a social organizational setting with results that warrant further study in education. (13 references) (GL)",

        "description":"This research examined the impact of the Apple Classrooms of Tomorrow (ACOT) project on seventh grade students in the year following their ACOT participation in sixth grade. Subjects were 24 former ACOT students and 29 matched control students, all of whom had attended sixth grade at the same school. All subjects were minority students representing an academically at-risk population. Research questions concerned the nature of the students' experiences during the post-ACOT school year and differences between the ACOT and control groups on measures of attitude and achievement. The questions were addressed using surveys of and interviews with students, parents, and teachers; a keyboarding skills test; course grades; and California Achievement Test (CAT) scores. Comparisons between  groups showed much greater similarities than differences. Where differences were found, however, they consistently favored the ACOT group. Those advantages included: (1) higher fall ratings of social skills by students' English teachers; (2) higher overall fall English ratings; (3) superior fall and spring keyboarding skills; and (4) higher fall and spring mathematics and CAT scores. Parents of students in both groups expressed consistently positive views about computers and their role in education. The absence of stronger differences between ACOT and control students is interpreted as reflecting less about the effectiveness of ACOT than about the difficulty of trying to overcome at-risk students' long-term histories of failure and disadvantaged home environments with relatively  short-term interventions. Data are displayed in six tables, and appended materials include the data collection instruments, interview summaries, and teachers' comments. (25 references) (GL)",

The study involved observation in two fourth grade classrooms--one week in an ACOT classroom (with high computer access), and one week in a non-ACOT classroom (without high computer access). Descriptive data were collected, including field notes, videotapes, interview notes, and student materials. The data were analyzed to identify conditions that affect student empowerment and to explore their relationship to the students' use of computers. Four classroom conditions were identified that promote student empowerment. Empowerment was high when students were able to shape their activities and assignments, when the  assignments were sizeable, when the assignments were cognitively and socially complex, and when evaluative feedback to students was primarily private and task-related. The research indicates that these four conditions are also related to HCA. Questions arising from the research are: (1) What is an appropriate level of student empowerment? (2) What kinds of classroom management techniques work well in student-empowered classrooms? and (3) Is HCA related to the students' use of productivity software? (22 references) (GL)",

        "description":"This report summarizes the curriculum development and research effort that took place at the Cupertino Apple Classrooms of Tomorrow (ACOT) site from January through June 1987. Based on the premise that computers make revising and editing much easier, the four major objectives emphasized by the computer-intensive writing program are fluency, knowledge of text structures, writing processes, and sharing. Research indicates that the computer helps facilitate each of these objectives. An exploratory study of the ACOT writing program using classroom observations, student work samples, and interviews with teachers indicated that: (1) quality of instruction, not merely access to computers, is the more significant factor in learning to write; (2) students maintained a level of enthusiasm,  comfort, and persistence seldom seen when they have to write by hand to plan, draft, and revise their writing; (3) writers were much more willing to share their work when they had legible, computer-produced text on their screens and on the printed page; (4) students wrote more and better when they used computers for their daily writing activities; (5) low-achieving students demonstrated significant improvement in the quantity and elaboration of their writing; and (6) once third-grade students learned to keyboard an average of 26 words per minute, they were able to record thoughts faster than they could by hand. Critical findings emerging from the study are: (1) any sound writing program can be better facilitated when children write with computers regularly; (2) effective instruction is  critical for students to become competent writers; and (3) collaboration between teachers and researchers can produce successful research-based instructional programs.

        "description":"This 2-year longitudinal study explored whether computers promote more sophisticated thinking, and examined how students' thinking changes as they become experienced computer users. The first-year study examined the thinking process of four ninth-grade Apple Classrooms of Tomorrow (ACOT) students. The second-year study continued following these students as well as five new ACOT ninth graders. Over two years the research team observed lessons involving writing and writing-related activities using computers. Researchers videotaped classroom activities and kept running records of student behaviors and interactions. In daily debriefings, students explained what they were thinking during their lessons. In more general interviews, they discussed the role of the computer and their  attitudes toward it. All of the students progressed markedly from the beginning of the study. They all became fluent computer users and all significantly expanded their skills, confidence, ambitions, and willingness to share their work with others. Students developed notable experience in problem solving with their computers, integrating visual representation of ideas with text, and developing, refining, and restructuring ideas through multiple drafts that included both text and graphics. During the study, researchers also observed students working with hypermedia technology in ways that suggest further possibilities for enhancing students' thinking skills. (4 references) (GL)",

        "description":"Eight Apple Classrooms of Tomorrow (ACOT) teachers met with software developers at the Florida Instructional Computing Conference in January 1989. During the session, the panel of ACOT teachers expressed their wants and wishes for educational software and developers responded with their own concerns. The face-to-face communication provided a successful strategy for discussing future software development for education. Teachers expressed their need for: (1) a network management system for curriculum software that will identify students' needs as well as record their progress; (2) curriculum software that combines practice with meaningful applications of the skills being taught (e.g., adding word processing capabilities to language arts software so that students can use  newly-acquired spelling and vocabulary skills to compose sentences or paragraphs); (3) software that complements a literature-based language arts curriculum; (4) software that supports the process approach to writing; (5) curriculum software for the Macintosh; and (6) interdisciplinary software. While teachers noted that many ACOT students do better on standardized tests because they are more highly motivated to learn with computers, several sites reported that test score averages have stayed the same since the introduction of ACOT programs. According to the teachers, students have become more active, independent learners as the result of computer use. Teachers saw their role changing from that of disseminator of information to facilitator of learning. (GL)",

Curriculums include subjects from reading, writing, and arithmetic to trigonometry, and networked software ranges from drill and practice to word processing and curriculum management tools. Teaching approaches that utilize the network span from directing students to work through electronic workbooks, to coaching them as they create entire curriculum units. Three kinds of network-supported  learning environments can be utilized: self-paced, project-based, and knowledge-building. The first two reflect the current activity of ACOT classrooms, while the third predicts future ACOT activities.

Toward this end, a multi-disciplinary literature review was conducted to identify guiding principles for system design and implementation. The direction of the literature review was shaped by Lucas' observation that the major reason information systems fail is that designers concentrate on technical aspects while they overlook users' organizational behavior and needs. The major research literature covered includes teacher planning, evaluation utilization, information representation and  decision making, computers and user friendliness, management information systems, and cognitive psychology. The rationale for selecting these major areas is described, and the conclusion summarizes the major principles and implications suggested by the research. The summary includes 10 guiding principles and an accompanying checklist of planning and review questions for the design and implementation of a maximally useful information system.

        "description":"A new approach to teaching an introductory accounting information systems course is outlined and the potential of this approach for integrating computers into the accounting curriculum at Manchester University (England) is demonstrated. Specifically, the use of a small inventory recording system and database in an accounting information course is described in order to illustrate the integrated nature of corporate data, the concepts of transaction processing and security, and the use of internally generated data for decision making, planning, and control. The coursework is centered around several major pieces of work. The first requires students to modify an existing suite of programs, in order to improve the controls within the system, the user friendliness, data validation, and  usefulness of the reports, and to incorporate an audit trail to record all the transactions and amendments to the master file. In addition to the programming, the students have to document the system and review the controls within it. The second task involves using the inventory database which they have generated to make cash flow forecasts and plans for the business with a spreadsheet model and a database enquiry language. Thirdly, they also evaluate similar stock recording systems. The paper describes the development of the course, methods for assessing students' work, problems with course evaluation, and prospects for future developments. (Author/GL)",

Further, it is intended to equip students with skills that will help them in business, legal, medical, and other professions where finding information is crucial to job performance. The guide is divided into topical sections addressing six types of research tools: encyclopedias; books; call numbers; periodicals; newspapers; statistical sources; and government documents. Students are instructed about the content and uses of these tools; however, the emphasis is on research strategies. The guide is also designed to function as a diagnostic tool to help teachers determine students'  progress on research papers and whether students have retrieved sufficient information and materials to write knowledgeably about their topics. Bibliography worksheets are included, which allow teachers to monitor student progress and suggest sections of the guide for students to examine and use for locating additional information or materials.

        "description":"Arguing that some books and documents must be conserved because they have scholarly value as well as for the information they contain, this report presents reasons for preserving such artifacts and recommends means of developing effective and efficient preservation strategies. Two strategies are suggested. The first advises identifying and ranking all artifacts of the greatest value and proceeding through a master list with preservation treatment as resources become available. The second advocates identifying materials on the basis of the urgency of need for preservation treatment--i.e., materials in fragile and embrittled conditions that are frequently exposed to the stresses of normal scholarly use. Strategy considerations are discussed, including the cost of preservation  treatment and gauging the appropriateness of a treatment by measuring its ability to capture all information of significance. Alternatives to expensive or &quot;full&quot; treatments--which can cost from several hundred to more than $1,000 per book--are also suggested. These alternatives emphasize preventive measures to reduce rates of deterioration and wear: (1) controlling the environment; (2) protective enclosures to mitigate the effects of poor environment or housing arrangement; and (3) sensible handling and use practices. Mass deacidification is mentioned as a major component of future strategies for artifact preservation. (SD)",

        "description":"This report is designed to accompany House of Representatives Bill (H.R.) 2742, which amends and reauthorizes the Library Services and Construction Act (LSCA) through 1994. In discussing the background of the bill and the need for the legislation, it is noted that, since recommendations from the 1991 White House Conference on Library and Information Services will be considered when the LSCA is reauthorized again in 1994, the House Committee on Education and Labor refrained from making significant modifications to the LSCA at this time. Explanations of the various provisions of the bill note that it does update the act to meet some of the current needs of libraries. For example, Title II is expanded to provide for the acquisition of equipment for technological enhancement; Title  III is modified to permit state library administration agencies to use up to 40% of their funds on preservation efforts; a new Title VII was added to reconfirm the authority of the Department of Education to assess and evaluate LSCA programs and $500,000 was authorized to support this activity; and a new Title VIII provides for the establishment of a Family Living Center in each state to encourage libraries to provide family oriented services and promote lifelong learning and family involvement in education. The sums authorized for each of the eight Titles are listed, and Congressional Budget Office cost estimates for LSCA funding for the years 1990 through 1994 are presented. Section by section analyses of the bill conclude the report. (SD)",

The long range plan for 1989-1993 is designed to serve as a framework for the annual programs during the 5-year period which are supported, fully or partially, with Library Services and Construction Act (LSCA) funds. In the event that state funds are also involved in a particular program, the plan addresses the total program, not just the portion funded with federal dollars. (These programs are delivered through Washington State Library's Public Services Division and through a contract with the Seattle Public Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped.) Under Title I of the LSCA, the plan covers public library services for  areas without services, areas with inadequate services, major urban resources libraries, the disadvantaged, literacy programs, persons with limited English-speaking proficiency, the elderly, the handicapped, the blind and physically handicapped, and the institutionalized. These funds can also be used to improve the ability of local public library personnel to access information from external resources. Title II supports the construction of adequate public library facilities. Statewide resource sharing and multitype library cooperation are supported by Title III. The Washington State Library mission statement, which is also included, outlines the goals for activities funded under Titles I, II, and III of the LSCA. (SD)",

The state library and six schools--University of South Dakota, South Dakota State University, Black Hills State College, Dakota State College, Northern State College, and South Dakota School of Mines and Technology--were visited by a study team appointed by the Executive Director of the South Dakota Board of Regents. Institution presidents, librarians, library staff members, faculty library committee members, students, and chief academic officers were asked to describe the problems and potentials they perceived at their particular institution's libraries. The six broad topics reviewed were  management, organization, access, collections, technology, and funding. Overall, it was discovered that a chronic imbalance exists between South Dakota's academic library commitment and the resources that are actually available. The major crisis is identified as the need to staff South Dakota libraries effectively; currently, library personnel are severely overworked. Other concerns and possible solutions are evaluated by topic. A sample reciprocal borrowing agreement as well as guidelines relating to access policy, bibliographic instruction, and collection development policies are appended. (SD)",

Activities designed to reach this goal included: (1) making subgrants available to various types of libraries to convert their catalogs to machine readable records; (2) updating and upgrading their bibliographic entries and adding new libraries and different types of materials to their databases; (3) engaging the services of consultants in networking to assist them in developing both long- and  short-range programs for local and statewide library automation and resource sharing; and (4) exploring new methods of storing and disseminating bibliographic data, of delivering library materials, and of transmitting documents and information. States with programs considered to have made an exceptional impact in the following areas are profiled: (1) establishing, expanding, and operating networks; (2) implementing automated circulation and resource sharing systems; (3) converting bibliographic holdings to machine-readable records; (4) offering interlibrary loan and document delivery services; and (5) providing continuing education programs.

The research team began by compiling a list of indicators that are commonly used to gauge library effectiveness within the areas of: (1) services access; (2) internal administrative processes; (3) administrative resources; (4) community relationships; (5) materials; (6) service output; (7) physical plant; (8) broad social impact; (9) service offering/fit with community; (10) service quality; (11) staff; (12) internal technical processes; and (13) user population/market penetration. A mail questionnaire was sent to members of seven major constituencies of public libraries at 84 sites, and an  overall response rate of 89.8 percent was achieved. The survey asked library managers, library service personnel, library trustees, library users, friends of the library, local officials from the library's funding jurisdiction, and community leaders with influence on library decisions, which indicators they most preferred. Librarians were also asked to rate their library's performance for each indicator. It was concluded that, although libraries which place priorities on different roles have different performance profiles for the indicators included on the survey, there is more agreement than disagreement among the various public library constituents as to what constitutes effectiveness.

        "description":"In order to identify the information needs of individual residents of the six New England states, telephone interviews were conducted to generate baseline data relating to information providers (e.g., availability, linkage between sources, and institutional barriers to information provision) and information seekers (e.g., problem awareness and articulation, and source awareness). The study examines information seeking needs arising from both work and non-work contexts of 2,400 residents from rural and urban areas in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. In particular, it focuses on: (1) information requirements; (2) the various types of information source providers consulted, e.g., libraries, friends, neighbors, relatives, television, and  newspapers; (3) the perceived level of user satisfaction with these providers; (4) a taxonomy of barriers to effective information seeking; and (5) reasons for library use and non-use. It was found that many people do not associate libraries with situations in which they have to find out something or solve a problem; if they do use a library, this source is frequently only one step in the information gathering process. It is recommended that libraries determine their unique role in the information seeking process and cooperate more fully with other institutional source providers so that both citizens and other source providers will associate libraries with the provision of information services. A copy of the telephone interview schedule is included. (42 tables, 17 figures) (SD)",

Results of a 1987-88 Quality Education Data survey are cited, indicating that 64% of 173 of the largest school districts in the country were already networking and 36% intended to be networking by 1990. The advantages of networks are briefly summarized, and a description of how LANs work is provided. Availability of network software in the recent past and at present is discussed, as is the response of software publishers to the increased demand for network software. Two case studies are presented. The first profiles the Island Park School District in New York, where three LAN laboratories are used for: (1) teaching basic skills to kindergarten through third  grade pupils; (2) instructing fourth through eighth grade students in skills reinforcement and word processing; and (3) offering creative applications in the library. The second case study reports on progress made in the 28,000-student Plano Texas School District, whose goal is to have a network that will channel everything a student does into one core electronic gradebook by 1992. Eight tips for buying a LAN are listed, together with six sources to consult for further information. (SD)",

The three-part CD-ROM \"Master Plan\" outlines the library's fundamental technological goals--i.e., to offer university-level technologies, to develop a CD-ROM end-user facility with ample resources and opportunities, and to use lottery funds to explore CD-ROM technologies. The 17 CD-ROMs and accompanying services that were rapidly introduced within a 1.5 year period are then discussed, including major issues faced during that time. Suggestions are offered for establishing a management system to allow end users to access the technologies with minimal supervision from library personnel. These suggestions include: (1) placing workstations  requiring the most librarian assistance closest to the reference desk; (2) setting up written procedures and dividing tasks--e.g., turning the machines on and off, changing paper, ink, and disks, etc.--among staff; (3) equipping workstations with signs, user aids, sample searches, a paper index and thesaurus, and sign-up procedures; (4) incorporating CD-ROMs into regular bibliographic instruction sessions; (5) cultivating an expert end user by producing advanced documentation; (6) roaming the CD-ROM area during peak times to answer questions; and (7) keeping statistics and means for program evaluation.

        "description":"In 1988, a study was conducted to determine whether a holistic or an isolated skills approach is more effective in improving the reading abilities and attitudes toward reading of predominantly Hispanic community college students. The study sample consisted of two groups of developmental reading students. The majority of students in both groups were female Hispanics with reading abilities between the 8th and 10th grade levels. According to Nelson-Denny Reading Test scores, both groups had comparable reading abilities. Reading attitudes were tested using the Mikulecky Behavioral Reading Attitude Measure. The first group consisted of 53 students who were taught the holistic approach to reading, using cognitive operations and thinking strategies. Class activities included reading and  discussing news magazine and newspaper articles, writing in journals, and reading self-selected novels. The non-holistic group of 46 students used the regular college textbook adopted for the developmental reading course which emphasizes isolated skills. The holistic approach group showed 100% attitude improvement, while 75% of the non-holistic group showed improvement. The study was replicated the following semester with the addition of students reading from 10th to 12th grade levels. These students showed marked improvement with holistic instruction, though attitude improvement was slightly less than in the first study. The Holistic method was found to be a positive factor in reading gains of students at the 10th and 12th grade levels, while both teaching methods showed positive results  for students at the 8th and 10th grade levels.

        "description":"Over a 6-month period in 1989, an institutional review was conducted of the San Francisco Community College District (SFCCD) in order to develop recommendations for an organizational and administrative structure that would facilitate the fulfillment of district goals, promote professional performance, enhance the implementation of significant new state mandates, encourage the efficient use of scarce resources, and enable the district to adapt to change in the future. The private consulting firm recruited to assess the SFCCD reviewed district documents; interviewed over 100 administrators, faculty, and other personnel; conducted case studies; received opinion surveys from employees and current and former students; and undertook comparisons with other community colleges in  California and nationwide. The analyses suggested that challenges to the district's effectiveness existed in the areas of organizational culture, mistrust, a common vision, cohesion, professionalism, communication, efficiency, planning, evaluation, and renewal. Four organizational models were considered to address these challenges: a status quo model; a parallel structure model, calling for the City College of San Francisco (CCSF) and the non-credit program to operate as two equal but independent components; the formation of a multi-college district; and an integrated systems model, which would consolidate the CCSF and the district's non-credit program into a single functioning organizational unit. The study report weighs each alternative and makes recommendations for reforms. Enrollment,  apportionment, revenue, expenditure, and comparative fiscal data are appended. (JMC)",

        "description":"This study was conducted to determine the characteristics, qualifications, frustrations, and institutional involvement of part-time faculty at community colleges. The study involved a review of the literature on trends in and statistics on part-time faculty employment; the motivations, characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, quality, frustrations, management, integration, involvement, and professional development of part-time faculty; and policy issues. In addition, the study included a survey of 314 part-time faculty at Fullerton College in California to determine the variety and scope of teaching methods used, the level of interest in faculty development activities, the organizational involvement of and communication with part-timers, and the length and depth of their  teaching experiences. Survey results included the following: (1) nearly 70% of the part-timers at Fulerton College were between the ages of 30 and 49, nearly 60% were male, and over 66% had a master's degree or doctorate; (2) the Business Division employed the greatest number of part-time faculty, followed by the Humanities Division; (3) 40% of the part-timers taught vocational subjects; (4) although part-time faculty used a variety of teaching methods, 93% used the traditional lecture method, 75% used class discussions, and over 50% used question-answer reviews and hands-on activities; (5) almost 97% gave students a course outline or syllabus at the beginning of the semester, nearly 94% provided grading criteria, and over 63% provided a week-by-week schedule; (6) 28% talked to their  department chairs and over half to other faculty once per week, but 82% did not attend division meetings; (7) about 19% had been teaching at Fullerton a year or less; and (8) 56% would like a full-time teaching position at any college. Conclusions regarding the application of a human resources development approach to part-time faculty are provided. The survey instrument is appended. (JMC)",

        "description":"In 1989, a study was conducted at Phoenix College to explore institutional turnover rates from the spring to the fall semester among part-time community college students. Surveys were administered in class during spring 1989 to a random sample of part-time, working students who were enrolled in 12 credit hours or less. Students were asked about their background, outside responsibilities, educational status, affective reactions to college, and academic performance. The majority of the sample had declared majors, felt that extra help was available from instructors, and were at least moderately satisfied with Phoenix College. Major study findings, based on survey responses from 426 students, included the following: (1) 82% of the students intended to stay at Phoenix College; (2) of  the students intending to leave, 90% planned to attend another college; (3) among students planning to transfer, 67% intended to enroll at a four-year institution; (4) 89% attained a grade point average (GPA) for the spring semester 1989 above 1.99; (5) course offerings and scheduling conflicts were the most frequently mentioned school-related obstacles; (6) time/scheduling at work and lack of money were cited often as non-school-related barriers. After excluding students with GPA's below 2.00, student responses were correlated with their continued enrollment at Phoenix College in fall 1989. Commitment to the intention to stay was the strongest predictor of continuation status. The survey instrument is appended. (WJT)",

        "author":["Head, Ronald B."],
        "description":"In an effort to provide faculty and administrators with a current profile of the diverse student population at Piedmont Virginia Community College (PVCC), a study was conducted of new students entering PVCC in fall 1989. The new student population, representing 33.5% of the total fall 1989 headcount, included 849 first-time students and 644 transfer students. The ratio of new to returning students has been relatively constant for the last five years, while the ratio of first-time to transfer students has not. During fall 1985, the number of first-time students was the lowest in 11 years and the number of transfer students was the highest ever. Between 1985 and 1987, however, first-time student enrollment increased by 14.5% and transfer student enrollment decreased by 1.9%.  Generally, during the past five years, the enrollment of new students has mirrored that of the student body as a whole. Demographically, the fall 1989 new and returning students were quite similar: the ratio of males to females was 2:3; the ratio of whites to minorities was 9:1; and between 25% and 30% of all new students were in the age bracket 25 to 34. More notable differences existed between the new and returning student populations. First-time students were typically younger than transfer students and more likely to study full-time at PVCC. Proportionally more first-time students studied during the day at the main PVCC campus than did transfer students, and a larger percentage of first-time students were enrolled in programs of study leading toward degrees or certificates. A research  summary is attached to the report. (JMC)",

The study is designed to gather longitudinal minority enrollment data and to examine trends which may assist those involved in planning student recruitment and retention activities. The findings of the 1989 study include: (1) 508 minority students enrolled at PVCC during fall 1989, representing 11.4% of the student body; (2) Blacks represented 9.18% of the student body and 80.5% of the minority student population; (3) of the remaining minority students, 62 were Asian or Pacific Islanders, 21 were Hispanic, 3 were American Indians or Alaska Natives,  and 13 classified themselves as \"other\"; (4) between fall 1988 and fall 1989, minority student enrollment increased 8.5% compared to a 6.1% total student enrollment increase; (5) 30.8% of all Black students attending PVCC in fall 1989 were male, 38.1% of all White students were male, and 43.4% of all minority students other than Blacks were male; (6) new Black student enrollment increased 21% between fall 1988 and fall 1989; (7) fewer Blacks than Whites were full-time students at PVCC during fall 1989; and (8) the second-year retention rate was higher for White than Black students. These trends suggest that PVCC is intensifying its efforts to draw and retain minority students, but it is still a long way from meeting its minority student recruitment and retention goals. (JMC)",

The first set of papers focuses on accountability and flexibility. The NCSBBC stresses the joint responsibility of all three boards for ensuring the common goals of literacy, transferability, and the wise use of resources. The NCSBE's paper supports increased flexibility for local school systems, the Department of Public Instruction, and itself; addresses the &quot;governance problem&quot; in public education; and advocates national educational goals and expectations. The UNCBG focuses on  the resources necessary for the support of public education and the measures needed to insure an effective and productive use of these resources. The second group of papers deals with economic development and work force preparation. The NCSBCC discusses responses to the changing marketplace, areas of mutual concern and cooperation, and strategies to field a competently trained work force. The NCSBE presents its goal of insuring that all high school graduates possess the necessary academic foundation and work and study habits to enter the work force. The UNCBG addresses the university's contributions to economic development in terms of instruction, research, and public service programs. The final set of papers deals with issues related to the transferability of education, skills, and  training. The NCSBCC's discussion focuses on community colleges' articulation with high schools and universities, transfer programs, and the &quot;tech prep&quot; initiative. The NCSBE's concerns relate to the need of large numbers of high school graduates for remedial education at the college level, the need for adequate guidance, and dual enrollment programs. The UNCBG underscores the importance of maintaining minimum admissions requirements while increasing student flow to the university. (WBT)",

        "description":"In 1989, Saddleback College's (SC's) English composition assessment process was evaluated to determine its success in placing students in appropriate courses. To gain entrance to one of SC's three composition courses, students must complete a prerequisite course or take the College English Placement Test (CEPT) and, at the option of the student, provide a writing sample. The three courses available are a university-level composition course, a composition class that satisfies the composition requirement for graduation with an associate degree, and a remedial/basic skills course. Random samples were chosen from the 2,714 students who had taken the CEPT between July 5, 1988 and January 31, 1989, from the students who provided a writing sample, and from the students who were not  placed with the CEPT. Study findings, based on a comparison of placement results and course success, include the following: (1) students who enrolled in a course more advanced than that suggested by their CEPT score succeeded at a higher rate than the group that took the recommended course; this may be due to the fact that a student would normally have needed to take the writing sample to qualify for placement into the more advanced class; (2) of the 244 students who took the writing sample, 94% were successful in English composition; the success rate for all students in the composition courses was 69%; (3) the success rates for CEPT-based placement students and students who took the prerequisite courses were about the same; (4) the success of the students placed through the assessment  process indicated that the cutoff scores for the CEPT were not too low, and that they may have been too high; and (5) the English composition faculty did not recommend a change in the minimum testing levels due to their experience with the results of student placement based on the CEPT scores. An appendix provides CEPT scores and data on course success. (JMC)",

The two main purposes of the study were to examine student enrollment behavior in recommended mathematics courses as well as to compare the success rates of students who enrolled in the recommended courses with those who enrolled in self-placed, higher level courses. All those who participated in the mathematics assessment process between July 5, 1988 and January 11, 1989 were included in the population for the study. The assessment process consisted of four separate examinations: Algebra Readiness; Elementary Algebra; Intermediate Algebra; and Pre-Calculus. In all, 2,354 exam were completed. Of the tested students, 1,336 enrolled in a  mathematics class within three terms. Major findings and recommendations of the study are as follows: (1) almost all (94%) of those who participated in the mathematics assessment process enrolled in courses in the district, and slightly less than two-thirds of those who enrolled, took a math class within three terms following completion of the assessment process; (2) nearly two-thirds of those who enrolled in a mathematics class chose the course recommended by the assessment/advisement process of the matriculation program; (3) students who followed the course placement recommendations successfully completed those courses at a much higher rate than students who placed themselves above their recommended level; (4) it was recommended that the procedure for registration in mathematics courses  be modified to give priority to students who had met course prerequisites or who had received a recommendation for a particular course level through the mathematics assessment process; and (5) it was recommended that the cutoff scores for course recommendations based on the assessment tests be modified. Summaries and analyses of the results of each of the four assessment tests are appended. (JMC)",

Chapter 1 provides guidance on the use of the report to compare institutional statistics with national and peer group norms and points out the limitations of the data. Chapter 2 summarizes findings in the areas of expenditures, revenues, service area, and staffing. Chapters 3 and 4 present data on the medians and quartiles for the full sample of 544 colleges, offering information on expenditures by major and detailed categories, computer-related expenditures, revenues, course enrollment distributions, salaries, and student/staff ratios. Chapter 3 also includes worksheets to facilitate comparative analyses. Chapter 5  contains medians and quartiles for college peer groups classified by enrollment size and vocational/technical designation. Report highlights indicate that 50% of the institutions surveyed: (1) spent more than 61% of their operating budget on instruction, research, public service, and academic support; (2) spent more than 37% of their operating budget on student services, institutional support, and plant operation and maintenance; (3) spent more than 3% of their operating budget on computer-related expenditures and 3% on utilities; (4) received more than 66% of their revenues from state and local appropriations; (5) enrolled more than one in every 18 people for credit or noncredit coursework during the year; (6) had student-to-faculty ratios for credit instruction of less than 17:1; and  (7) spent more than 58% of total current fund expenditures on current fund salaries and wages.

The sample population consisted of 160 GED recipients who had attended more than one semester at NSCC, declared a major, and earned a grade point average (GPA) of at least 1.00. The survey asked students for background information, reasons they enrolled in the GED program, post-GED college experiences, and suggestions for the program. Responses from 87 students were analyzed to identify the most significant factors influencing the success of GED recipients in higher education. Data indicated that GED recipients enrolled, matriculated, and earned above average cumulative GPA's in higher education. Significant factors in GED  recipients' college success included self-motivation; referral/support of family, friends, and college staff; consistent contact with one program coordinator and/or advisor; and use of college services. Six relevant factors were also identified: (1) participation in a formal GED preparation program and formal completion of at least the 10th grade facilitated success in higher education; (2) age was not a significant determinant of success; (3) those with higher GED scores did not necessarily go on to earn higher cumulative GPA's; (4) working full-time seemed to negatively influence academic achievement, while working part-time seemed to have no influence; (5) in a multi-campus setting, class attendance at two campuses had little effect on cumulative GPA's; and (6) students who used public  transportation to get to campus appeared to have lower cumulative GPA's than those who drove. Appended are the survey instruments, data highlights and analysis, and a detailed description of the research methodology. (WJT)",

In 1986, child care services were transferred from the Department of Social Welfare to the Department of Education. A working group then reviewed provisions and made recommendations. In January, 1989, an implementation unit was established in the Department of Education to carry out administrative tasks required for the establishment of a new administrative structure and policy base for early childhood education. In the future, a Ministry of Education will be responsible for providing policy advice to the Minister of Education on all aspects of education and for overseeing the implementation of national policies approved by the Minister. The most visible central agency for the support and  development of early childhood services will be the Early Childhood Development Unit. For the first 2 years of operation, the Unit will be fully funded by the Ministry, and will thereafter charge a fee for services. Another new agency, the Education Review Office will ensure that all early childhood services are accountable for government funds they spend and for meeting objectives negotiated in their charter. A Special Education Advisory Service will provide support services to early childhood. Implications of these developments are discussed. (RH)",

To date, no nationally respresentative data have been reported regarding the prevalence and nature of SCE programs in schools. In an effort to address this situation, this report synthesizes findings from the National Assessment of Chapter 1 studies. The report provides recent, nationally representative data that bear on the following questions: (1) How are districts and schools selected to operate SCE programs? (2) What is the distribution of SCE programs in Chapter 1 and non-Chapter 1 schools, and in schools with varying levels of poverty? (3) What within-school selection practices are used to determine which grades and students  are served by SCE? (4) What services do SCE programs provide? and (5) How do these services compare with Chapter 1 services? Several surveys and studies conducted for the National Assessment of Chapter 1, including the School Survey, the District Survey, the Targeting Study, the Resource Allocation Study, and the Program Design Study, provide the basic data for the report. Appendix A lists states included in the samples of SCE school principals and teachers. Appendix B describes school and district survey samples and standard error calculations.

Longitudinal research that involved a sample of black mothers and children from impoverished, overcrowded areas in Chicago is then presented. Mothers who gave birth in two major metropolitan hospitals were included in the sample if they were adolescents or had been so at the birth of their first child.  Mothers and infants were videotaped at birth and at various intervals for a six-year period after birth. Data on mothers and infants also included life histories of mothers, medical and work histories, and first-hand knowledge about friends, moves, drug problems, and other experiences. Most mothers did not talk about time to their children. Among those that did, increased talk about time was associated with increased seriation task scores. Concluding discussion concerns implications of the findings for schools and early intervention programs with young, black inner-city families. References are included. (RH)",

This paper identifies five approaches to multicultural education, then goes on to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the predominant human relations approach. Challenging issues encountered in applying multicultural education to early childhood programs are then discussed. It is argued that a program committed to multicultural education will create an environment, recruit a staff, involve community resources, and provide toys and learning materials that reflect the diversity of the broader society. Recommendations concern: (1) creation of a multicultural environment; (2) parent involvement; (3) developmentally appropriate activities; and  (4) holiday issues. It is concluded that the most important short-term goals may be enhancement of self-esteem and appreciation of human diversity. Long-range benefits will include preparing young people to build a more equitable and inclusive society. (RH)",

The study was carried out by an educational anthropologist, three teachers at a Friends (Quaker) elementary school, and a research assistant. An ethnographic case study approach which employed repeated participant observations and spontaneous and semi-structured interviews with teachers and students was used. Videotapes of activities, discussions, and classroom and playground interactions were made and analyzed. Findings document group processes and classroom discourse, planned and spontaneous activities,  and children's perspectives on issues related to their school, strategies for social problem solving, and peace. This paper presents an initial analysis of over 200 hours of observation data and interviews with teachers and children. Findings show the importance of the consistent creation of an open and supportive classroom climate which encourages children's self-expression, appreciation of others who have worked for social change, and repeated experiences in group processes dealing with social problem solving, consensus decision making, and centering techniques.

Children in treatment and control classrooms were given a brief lecture on good citizenship; additionally, treatment group subjects were provided a reward system designed to help them become good citizens. In the treatment condition, students were given opportunity to earn stars every time they did a kind or helpful act. Children were encouraged to report during daily circle time how they had been kind, cooperative, helpful, or had shared something with a peer. Each report had to be corroborated by at least one classmate. Prosocial  behavior increased significantly among second graders in the treatment group, not only in the classroom, but also in the hallways and lunchroom. Pre- to post-treatment differences in control subjects' prosocial behavior were not found. It is concluded that if young children are to act in caring and helpful ways, they must be consistently reinforced until acting in a prosocial manner becomes habitual and self-reinforcing. (RH)",

        "description":"This descriptive, longitudinal study investigated the emergent literacy skills of 45 children 4 and 5 years of age who were enrolled in an enrichment program for the gifted and talented. In two 10-week sessions conducted in subsequent years, children were requested to write a story and then read it aloud. Of central interest were four questions: (1) What forms of writing and reading were used? (2) What is the relationship between the writing systems chosen by a child and the form of the child's rereading? (3) What differences are observed in the writing and rereading of academically able children? (4) What is the effect of task-related variables on the child's writing? Over a 2-year period, 329 stories were collected. Stories were analyzed using Sulzby's (1985) scheme for  classifying the forms of writing and rereading from writing used by young children, and reanalyzed using modifications of that scheme. Considerable variability was found in the use of forms of writing and rereading among subjects, both within successive stories by the same child and between children. Higher levels of writing were not always accompanied by apparently higher levels of rereading. Age differences were noted in children's use of writing and rereading systems. More 5-year-olds used specific higher levels of writing and rereading than did 4-year-olds. Requesting children to write everything they could write resulted in more letter-based writing than did the request to write a story. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"As one phase of an extensive research project, normative data on the anatomical doll play of 209 nonreferred 2- through 5-year-old children were collected which revealed extreme, non-normative responses among some 4- and 5-year-olds. Later, a follow-up study was conducted to investigate the consistency of non-normative behavior over time and to explore children's knowledge of genital intercourse, as well as sources of that knowledge. In the normative study, 5 percent of subjects (Demonstrators) clearly placed the dolls in intercourse positions and 8 percent (Avoiders) refused to touch the unclothed dolls. Involving 40 of the original participants, including 10 Demonstrators and 10 Avoiders, follow-up occurred 16 months after the initial study and matched Demonstrator and Avoider  subjects to 20 controls on gender, race, and socioeconomic status. Findings revealed changes over time in Demonstrators' and Avoiders' behaviors that may be explained by cultural, maturational, and socialization factors. Most Demonstrators indicated that they had learned about intercourse from watching sexually explicit videos. Implications for children's testimony concerning sexual abuse and for understanding children's behaviors are explored. It is concluded that anatomical dolls can never be a definitive test of child sexual abuse, that the presence of an adult interviewer appears to have an inhibiting effect on children's exploratory behaviors with the dolls, that even 6- and 7-year-olds may need professional support in disclosing sexual abuse, and that further research is needed.

Data were collected by questionnaires sent to directors of 265 full-day, full-year preschool and ECE programs accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), which has criteria similar to those of S. 123, the Community Collaborative for Early Childhood  Development Act of 1989, also known as the &quot;Smart Start&quot; Bill. Findings concern: (1) overall costs of centers; (2) effects of variations in center characteristics on per-child cost; and (3) characteristics of children enrolled. Five appendices provide a comparison of S. 123 criteria and NAEYC standards, notes on study design and methodology, and technical material on the economic analysis of the costs of high-quality ECE.

Section 1 describes contributions of demographic analysis to the explanation of declining fertility in western industrialized countries and elaborates on the limits of pure demographic research with regard to factors that influence decisions of couples or individuals. Section 2 explores physiological and medical aspects of increasing infertility among the decreasing number of couples willing to have children. The section also notes the limited impact of this infertility on the explanation of the dramatic decline of fertility in western nations. Section 3 underscores the contribution of economic factors to  the decline in fertility and exposes major shortcomings of one strictly economic logic. Section 4 illustrates contributions of a sociological approach to understanding fertility decline and finds that its central concepts remain excessively abstract and remote from essential processes through which human preferences and values are shaped and acted upon. Section 5 examines the contours and efficacy of pronatalist population policies implemented in some western nations. Section 6 summarizes major limitations of current research and offers recommendations for further investigation. Just over 100 references are cited. (RH)",

Generalizations about the average family no longer suffice (if ever they did) as the basis for government policies and programs, corporate personnel practices, and the organization and administration of schools. The interests of families differ, and these competing interests find their expression in the increasingly polarized and politicized debate between those who would change reality in order to fit prescriptive, normative, and moralistic definitions, and those who seek to change the legitimated definitions of family in order to better fit evolving realities of family relationships and responsibilities. The conclusion to be drawn from the  portrait of family diversity is that no single or unitary family policy can adequately address the needs of Canada's families. While diversity is a central characteristic of contemporary family life, all families assume common tasks and responsibilities on behalf of their members and society as a whole. By identifying and emphasizing what families do, not what they look like, it is possible to uncover tha basis of a realistic definition of family that is useful for public policy development. Challenges of family matters and family change for policymakers are pointed out. (RH)",

The class taught through the Kodaly method received instruction that emphasized the development of rhythmic and melodic perception through visual, aural, and kinesthetic means. Traditional instruction did not include any consistent concern for perceptual or conceptual development. Findings indicated that both groups made significant gains in the areas of pitch and rhythmic discrimination. There was no significant difference between groups for tonal or rhythmic measures. However, data revealed that pupils from the Kodaly class could pitch-match and echo-clap better than students in the  traditional class. Qualitative data revealed a rich contrast between the classes in philosophies, teaching styles, and teacher-pupil interactions. Both teachers fostered the development of aesthetic musical experience and instilled a love of music in the children. Findings suggest that further research combining quantitative and ethnographic methods is needed to learn more about the effects of teaching styles on rhythmic and melodic discrimination.

Data on educational attainment show 11.7% of Hispanic males, age 25 and over, completing less than 5 years of school compared to 2.6% of the total population. Fifty-two percent of Hispanic males completed 4 years of high school or more compared to 76.4% of the total population. Only 12% of Hispanic males completed 4 years of college or more, while 24% of the total population attained this much education. Relative  percentages for females were very similar. Tables also show years of school completed by age, sex, and type of Hispanic origin and current educational enrollment. For those of Hispanic origin of both sexes, ages 3 to 34 years, 47.8% were enrolled in school in October, 1986, compared to 48.2% for those of non-Hispanic origin. The report includes five charts and 36 tables. Appendices discuss definitions, data sources, and the accuracy of estimates. (DHP)",

        "description":"This newsletter reports research findings from 31 rural New York school districts on teacher recruitment and retention. Of 31 superintendents interviewed in September 1987, 55% reported rising elementary enrollment; 61% had difficulty filling positions; 84% had too few applicants; and 68% reported a scarcity of appropriately certified applicants. Almost half reported particular difficulties in the areas of special education and foreign languages. Important characteristics of teacher candidates included certification (preferably multiple certification), overall quality and experience, and comfortable &quot;fit&quot; with the rural environment. Over half the superintendents said that unavailability of teachers had affected instructional quality in their districts. Of 63 teachers identified  by their superintendents as &quot;successful&quot; long-term teachers, over half had chosen their current jobs because they grew up or had family in the area, thought the area was good for raising a family, or liked the general friendliness of small schools. These factors were also important in teacher retention, along with few discipline problems, administrative supportiveness, and faculty collegiality. Strategies for teacher recruitment in rural districts must recognize teachers who will be satisfied and effective in rural schools, and must raise the visibility of rural schools and attack the negative stereotype surrounding them. Suggestions for action at state, regional, and local levels and in colleges of education are noted. (SV)",

        "description":"This report summarizes the results of three regional symposia held during 1987-88 to gather grassroots information about rural passenger transportation needs across the country. The first section describes the structural transformation of rural America in the 1980s: (1) the rural economy; (2) rural population trends; (3) impact of information technology on rural areas; (4) rural passenger traits and travel trends; (5) passenger transportation industry shifts; (6) effects of transportation deregulation on rural service by railroads, airlines, and intercity bus companies; and (7) cumulative impact of deregulation on the viability of rural communities. The second section discusses new roles for government and the private sector in maintaining rural mobility, and examines 21 examples  of how rural intercity passenger transportation needs can be met. From these examples emerges the concept of a connected rural transportation system, with local providers feeding into an intercity route network. The last section identifies essential components of a national strategy to reconnect rural areas of America: public and private cooperation, mobilization of support, community participation, defined government roles, linking of services, market research and development, diversification of funding sources, resource management, and identification and elimination of barriers. Appendices contain 3 maps; 24 tables; details of the symposium process; goals, constraints, and strategies outlined at each symposium; and planning committee members and speakers. (SV)",

        "description":"This paper describes efforts to identify students at risk of dropping out of school in 21 school districts in central New York. Examination of the student folders of 309 recent dropouts and interviews with principals, superintendents, and guidance counselors provided data, which were organized on student dropout data sheets, a protocol developed from standard indicators in the dropout literature. Incomplete files, inconsistent information, and errors in test score data made sophisticated statistical analysis inappropriate. As an alternative, &quot;profiles&quot; were developed to provide a crude system for dropout classification. These profiles were: (1) the &quot;slow learner&quot;--the traditional dropout, most likely to be identified as &quot;high risk&quot;; (2) the student whose general achievement  diminishes each year, usually not identified until secondary school; (3) the student with an uneven pattern of performance and diminishing achievement in particular areas; and (4) the student strongly affected by an event or situation, such as pregnancy or family problems. At least 20% of the student folders fit each of these four profiles. The profiles have good potential as useful tools for school personnel concerned with early identification of &quot;at risk&quot; students. This paper contains an outline of student characteristics and suggested remediation for each dropout type, and a sample student dropout data sheet. (SV)",

        "description":"Two studies in southeastern Sweden examined rural children's conflicting attitudes toward environmental change in the local community. Following a yearlong curriculum in environmental studies, 14 fifth and sixth graders in Ramkvilla were presented with an imaginary scenario involving the construction of a new factory. Their small, somewhat idyllic community has been dependent on agriculture and tourism. Negative and positive consequences of the new industry were integrated into the scenario. Content analysis of students' written responses revealed consistently strong positive attitudes toward the change in the areas of &quot;more children in school&quot; and &quot;more jobs in the community&quot; and negative attitudes in the area of &quot;consequences for nature.&quot; In a similar study in Mullsjo, 25  students in grades 3-6 who had completed a yearlong environmental curriculum wrote essays about the changes they would meet in the future and their attitudes toward these changes. The strength of students' attitudes were affected by the interaction of: (1) perception of the geographical or historical distance of the change; (2) whether the change was viewed as positive or negative; and (3) whether the change was viewed with empathy or indifference. These results illustrate rural students' conflicting attitudes toward environmental change. To avoid fostering such conflicting feelings, environmental education must employ a global perspective on society and its future, and must incorporate cultural and ecological development relationships.

        "description":"Research on school effectiveness points to administrative leadership as one of the critical factors in creating effective schools. There is perhaps no educational setting in which this relationship is stronger than the small rural school district. In 1988 a national survey of school administrators conducted by the State University of New York at Buffalo found that 349 of 1,123 respondents were from rural districts. This paper presents the perceptions of these rural administrators on: (1) the quality of their graduate school training; (2) the relationship between theory-based training and experiential learning in administrative practice; (3) the importance of university-school district collaboration; (4) rural-urban differences in administrative salary and job satisfaction; (5)  the extent of systematic in-service professional development available to administrators; (6) participation of women and minorities in rural administration; and (7) the impact of educational reform efforts on rural districts. These responses are compared to those of urban and suburban administrators and are discussed in relation to the deficiencies in administrator preparation reported in \"Leaders for America's Schools,\" the 1987 report of the National Commission on Excellence in Educational Administration. Recommendations for pre-service education of rural administrators focus on preparing administrative generalists, providing exposure to rural settings through field experiences, and incorporating aspects of rural sociology and economics.

High suicide rates, increased violence, families separated in order to find work, homelessness, and hunger afflict the rural and small town poor. This document contains testimony from poor and homeless rural people; the director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities; workers in rural health care; and representatives of Head Start, community services, and mental health care. These speakers describe the crisis facing rural families and communities due to rural economic distress. Many rural workers were unable to take care of housing, medical care, and food for their families even holding two or three jobs. A new class of migrant workers is made up of workers from rural areas camping in  more affluent areas while doing day work. Several of those testifying cite the failure of the welfare system to help people until they have lost or sold everything, and others testify that private sources also provided no help. Rural workers are characterized as an unorganized, cheap labor source supporting more affluent rural areas of the country. The unwillingness of the federal government to support basic social services and of many private industries to pay a living wage is also discussed. (DHP)",

Thus, in the long run, education for all citizens may be the most critical ingredient to the success of rural community development programs. Schools can further contribute to the development of rural communities by providing an explicit community focus to educational programs. This paper describes the declining economics of rural America in the 1980s, manifested in lost farms, closed businesses, unemployment and underemployment, eroding tax bases, and the inability of local governments to provide needed services. These changes are not just cyclical, but part of a broader restructuring of the national economy. Community capacity to alter this process can be affected by  investment in education, with students benefitting through higher earnings and communities benefitting from improved schools and the increased productivity of better educated individuals. Schools can also make explicit contributions to community development by delivering quality education to all students, expanding their mission to include meeting the community's broader educational needs; teaching about the community and how it works; focussing on modern technology; leadership skills, and entrepreneurial abilities; and increasing public awareness of community educational needs.

The schools were located in Anne Arundel County, Maryland; Palmyra, New Jersey; and northern York County, Pennsylvania. Implementation costs were supported by the school districts, federal grant money, and a CMI-system vendor. Implementation process involved: (1) negotiations with the school districts; (2) facilities modification; (3) hiring of full-time laboratory managers; (4) development of guides to correlate district curriculum objectives with CMI learning activities; (5) hands-on training of laboratory managers and teachers; (6) laboratory use by all regular students 30 minutes daily, in remedial summer programs, and in adult  literacy instruction; and (7) planning for school district funding of program continuation. Program evaluation showed: (1) modest student achievement gains; (2) overwhelmingly positive student attitudes; (3) teachers' initial use of the system as a supplement; (4) widespread interest in exploring the system's capacity to individualize instruction; and (5) readjustment of the schedule of the school day, teachers' instructional sequences, and student grouping patterns.

They are from many different countries, with different histories and ethnicities. This booklet describes the situation of Hispanic Americans, the fastest growing minority group in the country. The largest group of Hispanics in the United States is Mexicans, followed by Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Central and South Americans from 16 different countries. The relative youth of the Hispanic American population and both high fertility and high rates of immigration are all factors in the rapid growth of this population. Ninety percent of Hispanics live in 9 states--5 of them in the Southwest. New York, Florida, Illinois, and New Jersey also have substantial Hispanic populations  (varying from 11% in New York to 3% in New Jersey). Most Hispanics of Mexican origin live in the Southwest; most Hispanics of Cuban origin live in Florida; and most Hispanics of Puerto Rican origin live in the Northeast. Hispanics generally have educational attainment lower than the national average. Although they are active members of the country's labor force, they are often forced to take lower paying jobs with less security. These factors contribute to high poverty among Hispanics. This booklet briefly examines the history of Mexican Americans, Cubans, and Puerto Ricans in the United States. Immigration of Central and South Americans is also noted. Important issues concerning Hispanic/Americans are immigration laws, future work force and economic impacts, education, English-only laws,  and political representation and participation.

        "description":"A 1988-89 statewide survey of 244 Nevada counselors examined the differences between rural and urban counselors in perceiving five imperatives through which counselors can contribute to educational improvement. These are: (1) providing an increased emphasis on learning and cognition; (2) diffusing guidance and counseling throughout the curriculum; (3) incorporating life-career planning in counseling; (4) planning for professional renewal; and (5) implementing ongoing assessment of personal and program effectiveness. Respondents' opinions about the proposed statewide changes in counseling were also examined. The instrument included 66 items regarding: (1) professional activities; frequency of developmental guidance and counseling elements in the schools' programs; (2) allocation  of time; (3) counselors' beliefs regarding the goals of guidance and counseling programs; and (4) the degree to which such goals are supported by their schools' programs. The results suggest that rural counselors and urban counselors differ significantly on all measures of these variables. Urban counselors had greater access to opportunities for professional development, but experienced greater pressure regarding the types of peripheral duties they must assume in their roles as counselors. Rural counselors had inadequate resources to offer comprehensive programs or to obtain additional training, but they often have less complex work situations and more contact with students and teachers.

The book contains two parts. The first part reports on three surveys assessing (1) the current conditions and needs of 107 academic programs of Indian studies (types, financial sources, institutional cooperation, and support programs); (2) occupational needs of 117 Indian communities (community types, job market in the community, and needs for vocational and professional training); and (3) problems and needs perceived by 30 Indian college seniors (causes of dropout and specific educational needs). Major findings are: programs were rated high in financial assistance but low in sharing information on strategies and  success stories; the communities indicated high needs for trained people in professional fields, particularly in the humanities-based professions; students reported differences associated with financial problems, cultural pressure, and psychological adjustment. Steps in forming an Indian studies program and institutional barriers that keep Indian students from succeeding are discussed. Based on the research findings, the gaps between available programs and determined needs are summarized, and recommendations are made for program development. The book contains 50 references and the questionnaires used the in surveys. The second part of the book is a directory of 105 programs of American Indians studies. (GGH)",

        "description":"American Indians have suffered a series of alterations in federal/tribal relations with rebuilding of Indian communities revived one moment but dashed the next by changes in national policy. This collection of papers focuses on consequences of an ever-changing American Indian policy and its impact on the lives and cultural values of American Indians. Major topics are: (1) the Indian New Deal, accompanied by both policy contradictions and successful revitalization of tribal viability under the Office of Economic Opportunity; (2) the Indian Reorganization Act and its contributions to the instability of tribal governments on some reservations and the legal course of Public Law 280 (transferring federal civil and criminal jurisdiction over Indians to some states); (3) pro-Indian  legislation of the 1970s, including the American Indian Religious Freedom Act; (4) economic issues and economic development projects in three different Indian communities; (5) federal funding priorities and higher education policies manipulating Indian education; (6) Native American languages and communication norms that could enhance the education of Indian children and open new linguistic research avenues; and (7) a recent study of the Indian elderly that highlights differences between the rural and urban populations.

        "description":"The surest way to preserve a traditional art form is to continue its practice. However, it is also possible for Indian and other Native American people to use modern documentation tools to safeguard the survival of their cultural traditions for the future. This book presents a selection of professional documentation techniques that are especially practical, effective, and adaptable for community use. Chapters examine organizing a cultural preservation project; locating resources; preparing a proposal; using the still camera, tape recording equipment, and video tools; preserving tapes; and preserving traditional art collections. It is emphasized that it does not necessarily take a large sum of money to make a good cultural preservation project. Above all, people--and especially  community involvement and support--make a project work. This book provides general information about organization and personnel as well as technical information about tools and methods. Sample forms, proposals, registration forms, timetables, and budgets; checklists; detailed instructions for using cameras and tape recorders; and suggestions for collecting and maintaining artifacts and keeping collection records are provided and are accompanied by many drawings, diagrams, and photographs. This book contains 119 references. (DHP)",

        "description":"The position of rural principal differs from that of the urban school administrator, often requiring more sacrifice to earn administrative credentials and demanding day-to-day involvement in every aspect of school activity. This paper reports the results of a 7-state study of 600 principals to determine differences between principalships in rural and urban settings, the attractions of rural principals' positions, and to identify the future rural administrators. Of the respondents, 82% were male. Only 47% planned to be in their present positions in 5 years. All had teaching experience, 69% in rural schools, with the majority having taught more than 6 years; however, 55% had not taught in their present districts prior to becoming administrators, and 59% noted that no one else in  their districts held administrative certification. Only 60% of those principals whose teaching experience was at the elementary level were classroom teachers. The others were physical education teachers, counselors, or special education teachers. The greatest source of supplemental income was spouses' salaries. The paper raises a number of questions about the source of future principals, the reasons men comprise the overwhelming majority of principals, whether standards for rural principals should be raised or altered, and the need for special programs to prepare rural principals.

        "author":["Goldsmith, Oliver Scott"],
        "description":"Alaska faces a problem that is easy to explain but hard to solve: state government is spending more than it collects. The budget crisis looms because oil production, which supplies 85% of the state's general fund revenues, will soon begin to fall as the Prudhoe Bay oil field is depleted. This paper examines the potential deficit and the effect it will have on Alaskans. It considers four possible ways to deal with the fiscal gap from the present to 2010: (1) stumble from year to year; (2) deplete the permanent fund; (3) freeze the budget; or (4) cut spending and raise taxes. Only economic effects, not political difficulties, are considered. Under each scenario effects on revenues, expenditures, employment, economic well-being, and the permanent fund are examined. Decisions are  discussed in the areas of (1) current versus future spending and economic activity; (2) public versus private spending; (3) gradual versus abrupt transition; and (4) public versus private economic activity. The effects of the decisions may fall on different areas of the state, different segments of the population, and at different times, depending on the choices made. Although these decisions are political, they can best be made using information about the implications of different choices. (DHP)",

        "description":"The Great Starts Mathematics Approach, the early childhood component of the Staff Development Program in Mathematics, Science, and Computer Science, is a collaborative 3-year staff development project. The project's goal is to develop a model for improving mathematics instruction in kindergarten through second grade. This is the evaluation report of the implementation of the program during the project's second year. School principals, teachers, and paraprofessionals from two schools attended monthly mathematics workshops held after school. Training activities focused on teaching mathematical relationships and concepts through directed play and exploration with concrete materials. Although student achievement as measured by the scores on the second-grade mathematics test did not  show improvement, correlational analyses indicate some relationship between teaching techniques as observed in the classrooms and test scores. Children whose teachers used more product-oriented teaching techniques tended to have lower scores on the mathematics test than children whose teachers used process-oriented techniques. Chapters included are: (1) &quot;Introduction&quot;; (2) &quot;In-Service Professional Development and Staffing&quot;; (3) &quot;Classroom Implementation&quot;; (4) &quot;Student Achievement&quot;; and (5) &quot;Conclusions and Recommendations.&quot; Descriptions of classroom activities and teaching techniques used by field staff in the classroom are appended.

The primary question addressed is, what is the relationship between what parents report that they do with their children in terms of activities, home-process variables, books, and other experiences and the children's science concept and process acquisition? At kindergarten-level, correlations of the indices developed from the parent questionnaires and the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT), the Test of Basic Experiences (TOBE-2), and Chicago Reading tests showed significant relationships on all levels. At the first grade level, significant relationships were  found between the six subscores of the Error Detection Test, CIRCUS-Think It Through, and the TOBE-2. At the second grade level, results from the Sequential Test of Educational Progress (STEP) Science test and criterion-referenced tests correlated significantly with parent indices, except for experiences with parents. Science questionnaires for the parents of kindergarten, first, and second grades students are appended. (YP)",

Sixty children of approximate ages 6, 9, and 12 were given a questionnaire to investigate their knowledge of the size, shape, and motion of the earth and the sun, and the notion of gravity. The results showed that children formed an intuitive understanding of the world around them based on their belief of the earth as flat and stationary rather than a rotating sphere. As a result, they infer that things fall in a downward direction rather than toward the center of the rotating sphere, things fall in a downward direction rather then toward the center of  the spherical earth, and the sun and the moon move in an up/down or east/west direction, causing the day/night cycle. Children eventually change their intuitive understanding as they are exposed to the Copernican theory of the solar system. The process of conceptual change is a slow and gradual one and one that goes through different levels of understanding. (Author/YP)",

It was developed by teachers, administrators, parents, and students from the perspective of what they wanted students to be like on high school graduation day as the result of science experiences received while attending DoD schools. The developers felt that science study in DoD schools should be hands-on and provide learners with a realistic and functional understanding of the world of science. Teachers are encouraged to use this guide as the focal point of their science program, realizing that textbooks and activities are aids to learning. The program is based on six major program strands including:  develop positive attitudes; apply rational and creative thinking processes; demonstrate an awareness of the global significance of science and technology; acquire, comprehend, and apply scientific knowledge; utilize science experiences in planning a personal future; and use the language of science.

        "description":"An investigation of Ontario high school students' understanding of acids and bases with quantitative and qualitative methods revealed misconceptions. A concept map, based on the objectives of the Chemistry Curriculum Guideline, generated multiple-choice items and interview questions. The multiple-choice test was administered to 34 grade 12 students who had completed the grade 11 advanced chemistry program. Eight of these students, from three levels of chemistry achievement (high, medium, and low), participated in 40-minute clinical interviews and follow-up interviews. Analyses of the quantitative and qualitative data revealed that the students held idiosyncratic conceptions of acids and bases which did not coincide with the concepts found in the curriculum guidelines or  prescribed texts. The students in this exploratory study retained their everyday concepts of acids and bases and grasped few of the scientific concepts. More instruction time may help students to develop understanding of scientific concepts such as ions and pH. This document includes an introduction, discussions of methods and analyses, cases and concept maps, findings and a list of 39 references. Appendices include a copy of the multiple choice test, and a copy of each of the interview tasks. (Author/CW)",

In that resolution, the Legislature also directed the Commission to assess the impact of the Minority Engineering Program in reducing the attrition of minority students in engineering education. This report responds to that resolution by providing information about the attrition rate of women and ethnic minority engineering students and about the impact of the Minority Engineering Program. The study includes discussions of continuation and graduation  rates, differing tracking rates by institution and campus, and discussions of the background, effectiveness, characteristics, significant components, and recommendations of the Minority Engineering Program.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the degree of consistency of teachers' content coverage reports with logical expectations about the contents of a course with a given title for two consecutive years and to detect the effects of content coverage by comparing student performance patterns associated with teachers' reports of content coverage for 1988 and 1989. In this study, analyses were based on teacher and student data from approximately 300 sections of mathematics courses in Pre-Algebra,  Math A, Math B, Algebra I, and Geometry. Across the 5 courses and 12 topics in general, the patterns of responses are consistent with what might be the expected curriculum patterns in mathematics courses at each level. Topic coverage is reported for each of the courses. The pattern of performance on items from the Mathematics Diagnostic Testing Program tests are reported according to topic and specific teachers' reports of content coverage.

        "description":"During the last 10 years, cognitive science researchers have produced research findings that have great potential for increasing students' understanding of science. However, commercial publishers continue to produce textbooks and teacher's guides in traditional ways. This project developed a prototype unit which used an alternative approach to curriculum development. The unit was a rewritten version of the existing &quot;Models of Matter&quot; unit. The curricular decisions were based on an extensive program of research in student conceptions and classroom teaching using preclinical interviews, pretests, classroom observations, journals by collaborating teachers, post-clinical interviews, and posttests. Five curricular issues discussed are: (1) macroscopic and molecular conceptions; (2)  epistemological status of molecules; (3) physical characteristics of molecules; (4) nature of scientific explanations; and (5) need to balance scientific elegance and student comprehension. This paper argues that fundamental rethinking of science education curriculum is in order and research findings can be used to improve student achievement in science in basic areas such as kinetic molecular theory.

Inferences for this theory are made on the basis of a test-case of the proposition that differential socialization predicts entry into the scientific talent pool. The Early Childhood Women in Science Scale (ECWiSS) was employed in a pilot administration to a sample of 791 students from New York City schools. Controlling for ability, significant differences in attitude were associated with various gender, age/grade, and socioeconomic status with gender explaining the greatest proportion (11%) of the total variance (16%). The findings suggest moderate normative compliance and the salience of including early childhood as a  critical consideration in models of ascriptive and meritocratic processes affecting recruitment to science.

The project's primary objective was to provide a structured program of parent and community involvement in high school citizenship preparation, focusing on the U.S. Constitution and Government. Secondary objectives addressed instructional quality and emphasized the development of student thinking, decision-making, and interpersonal skills. The project linked the study of the Constitution in 10th grade U.S. history classes to an interdepartmental (English-U.S. history) student project on family history.  Evaluation focused on teacher perception of the effectiveness of the project as well as on pre- and post-measures of student attitudes toward and knowledge of the Constitution. Teachers identified several strengths and weaknesses of the project, and gave it a very positive subjective evaluation. Objective evaluation, based on students' pre- and post-tests, showed less definitive improvement in students' knowledge and attitudes. Recommendations for replication of the study are made and emphasize design, implementation and testing strategies, and cost considerations. An appendix includes a pre-test, a post-test, project activities, and an outline of six study units. (Author/AS)",

        "description":"The techniques used for teaching college economics have remained relatively unchanged over the past few decades. These techniques do not give the students an opportunity to apply, to develop, or to practice the economic theory they read about and hear in lectures. They tend to reinforce student assumptions about the subject's &quot;givenness&quot; and de-emphasize the discipline's dynamic nature. The recent revolution in micro technology and the availability of software have teachers of economics with an opportunity to let students in on the work of their profession, that is, &quot;doing&quot; economics. A computer laboratory provides students with a space within which to work closely with their professor or a graduate student. The increased availability of the instructor and the increased  interaction with the material can help students learn more and learn more effectively. Even at the undergraduate level science can be exciting when both anticipated and unanticipated results arise during the experimentation process. Since undergraduate would-be economists rarely experiment, the thrill that comes with discovery is missing. Only by adopting a lecture/laboratory format can theoretical knowledge and experimental discovery be brought together to enhance student learning. This type of approach is being tried at Denison University (Ohio). A 51-item bibliography is included. (JB)",

        "description":"Critical thinking skills must be emphasized in schools if excellence in education is to be realized. The lesson plans in this learning module were designed with this issue in mind. The lessons focus on the concept of family as a universal institution. But family structures may vary due to specific cultural history, rapid technological advancement, religious beliefs, or economic and social requirements. It is felt that students can be made to think critically about such societal issues if they are presented with cultural situations. If students are made to understand that religious, environmental, and ecological factors differ from culture to culture and that these factors, in turn, influence the types of institution a culture develops for itself, then they may be able to  critically analyze problems associated with institutional change in their own society and to understand the significance of structural alternatives. The lessons compare family structures in the United States and Nigeria and may take from six to eight class periods to complete. Strategies are suggested for presenting the lessons that focus on critical thinking skills. A short true/false test and a 12-item bibliography are included. (JB)",

This curriculum is developed around five general themes, each corresponding to a specific unit. The general goals for the units are: (Unit 1) to increase students' exposure to the world outside themselves, to other cultures, and to the natural and physical world; (Unit 2) to increase students' critical thinking skills and understanding of how people make decisions and form attitudes; (Unit 3) to promote skills of constructive communication and conflict resolution; (Unit 4) to increase students' knowledge of nuclear technology and their understanding of its benefits and limitations; and (Unit 5) to increase  students' understanding of armed conflict and modern weapons issues. This is a K-12 curriculum, but many of the topics in units 4 and 5 are more appropriate for older children. For the most part, the lessons should be integral parts of existing curricula. Care has been taken to provide teachers with examples of what might be done to promote nuclear age education in nearly all subject areas. The units are not designed to be taught in sequence and can be integrated into the curriculum whenever the teachers wishes. Whenever possible, lessons and activities should involve students in direct, first-hand experiences. The lessons presented can be adopted directly, adapted to a particular school's needs, or taken as suggestions of what might be developed. A bibliography lists 30 curriculum  materials, 50 books, pamphlets, articles, 50 teaching resources, 21 organizations, 9 sources for nuclear statistics, and 11 supplements and bibliographies. (JB)",

They represent an extension of the Administrative Records method, the newest of the estimating techniques used at the U.S. Census Bureau for producing population estimates. Two chapters are devoted to a detailed discussion of the methodology used to derive the estimates that are presented in the remaining chapters. One chapter is devoted to trends in the Black population, one to trends in the \"other races\" population, and one to trends in the Hispanic population, all for the period 1980 to 1985. Fifty-one tables provide detailed statistical information. Highlights of the report include the following: The Black population in the United States experienced an 8.3 percent growth rate between 1980  and 1985. The \"other races\" population increased 36.1 percent in that time span, due largely to international immigration. The Hispanic population increased by 22.9 percent over the same period. The South continues to have both the greatest number of Blacks and the greatest proportion of total population that is Black. The \"other races\" population constitutes a much greater share of the total population in the West than in other parts of the country. California and Texas contain almost 55 percent of the Hispanics in the country. More than 10 percent of the nation's Black population lives in the New York City metropolitan area. By 1985, greater Los Angeles had become the first U.S. metropolitan area to have an \"other races\" population in excess of one million. Over one-half of the Hispanic  population in 1985 lived in seven metropolitan areas, with Los Angeles having by far the largest concentration.

The nation's population reached 245,110,000 on January 1, 1988. The number of births in 1987 was 3,809,000. About 26 percent of the nation's growth during 1987 was due to net immigration. Average life expectancy at birth in 1987 was 74.9 years. The South and West continue to dominate the nation's growth in the 1980s. Females constitute  the majority of the population in all states except Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada, North Dakota, and Wyoming. The Northeast was the region with the oldest population in 1987. From 1981 to 1987, the farm population declined at an average rate of 2.5 percent per year. The annual rate of moving between March 1986 and March 1987 was 18.6 percent.

The statistics on childbearing and birth expectations of U.S. women contained in the detailed tables of this report are based on data collected in the June 1988 supplement to the Current Population Survey. The principal findings of the survey follow: Among women who had a child in the year preceding the survey, 51 percent were in the labor force. This rate was substantially higher for women with four or more years of college than for women who had completed less than 12 years of school. The fertility rate for women 30 to 34 years old was 81.6 births per 1,000 women, up from the 1980 rate. Twenty-five percent  of women in their early thirties were childless. Hispanic women had an estimated fertility rate of 94.0 births per 1,000 women 18 to 44 years old, significantly higher than the fertility rate for non-Hispanic women (67.5 per 1,000). Forty percent of first births between 1985 and 1988 for women 15 to 29 years old were either born out-of-wedlock or were conceived before the woman's first marriage. This proportion ranged from 32.8 percent for White women to 78.8 percent for Black women. Among Hispanic women, the figure was 42.7 percent. Women 18 to 34 years old in 1988 expected to have an average of 2.1 children in their lifetime. About 15 percent of women 18 to 34 years old, however, were uncertain about their future childbearing plans.

Intended particularly for students who had completed foreign study in Western Europe, the course focused on the patterns and trends in politics, social structure, intellectual life, and literature and the arts which seem to dominate Western European life. Special consideration was given to the extent to which these patterns and trends are: (1) interconnected; (2) reflective of an emergent European culture (as opposed to separate national cultures); and (3) of consequence for both the future of Europe and  for relations between Europe and other nations. The course was divided into five major topical sections: (1) &quot;The Development of Contemporary European Social Structure;&quot; (2) &quot;The Intellectual and Cultural Institutions of Europe;&quot; (3) &quot;European Art, Music, and Literature;&quot; (4) &quot;The Political and Economic Structure of Europe;&quot; and (5) &quot;Environmental Issues.&quot; Each of these topics was discussed by faculty members at the College with expertise and research interests in these areas. One faculty member coordinated the presentations and facilitated the students' attempts to bring all of the information into some manageable form. At the end of the quarter, the students put on a mini-conference on &quot;The Future of Europe&quot; with their own papers and presentations. (JB)",

The first two lessons, &quot;Columbus: The Man and the Myth&quot; and &quot;Columbus and the Known World: How Much Did He Really Know?,&quot; (D. Beal) provide students with opportunities to learn about Columbus as a person and dispel the commonly-held view that everyone in 1492 believed the world was flat. &quot;Who Discovered America?&quot; (C. Risinger) uses cooperative learning techniques to teach about other explorers who preceded Columbus and why his voyage receives the most attention. &quot;A Mystery in History&quot; (E. Holt) examines the current debate about the actual site where Columbus landed on October 12, 1492. The second Holt lesson,&quot;Columbus and the New World: Through European Eyes,&quot; examines the persistence of ethnocentrism when two different cultures are brought together. &quot;The Ecological Consequence of 1492&quot; (A. Backler) focuses instruction on the ecological impact for North America of the linking of the Old and New Worlds that began with Columbus's voyages. All of the lessons include student objectives and instructional procedures. Most have student worksheets, readings, maps, or other materials to assist in lesson implementation.

        "description":"Nearly 20,000 cubic feet of U.S. Senate records are currently entrusted to the care of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). This guide to those records is divided into 22 chapters. Chapter 1 describes the published records of Congress and related published research tools. It provides general information about the National Archives Senate file classification system, the arrangement of the unpublished paper records, and how to access the Senate records. Chapters 2 through 17 describe the records of each Senate standing committee for which the National Archives has records from the beginning of the standing committee system in 1816 to 1968. There is one chapter for each of the standing committees and each is divided into chronological periods. Chapters 18 and 19  describe records of the Senate select and special committees and the joint committees of Congress. Chapters 20 and 21 concern the noncommittee records and executive proceedings of the Senate. Chapter 22 discusses the committee and noncommittee records of the Senate from 1969-1988. Most of these records are closed to research at this time, but they are described briefly to inform researchers about materials that will be available in the future. The guide also includes as appendices lists of majority and minority leaders, a list of secretaries of the Senate, beginning and ending dates for each Congress, a glossary of legislative and archival terms used in the guide, a selected bibliography, a list of published and unpublished finding aids to Senate records, and a list of National Archives  microfilm publications of Senate records.

        "description":"The purpose of this guide is to analyze and describe the records of the U.S. House of Representatives in a format that makes them accessible to researchers. The guide is arranged in 25 chapters. Chapter 1 guides the researcher through the procedures that many have found useful to follow when doing research in the records of the House and the Congress. Chapters 2 through 21 contain the descriptions of the records of the standing committees of the House from 1789 through 1968. With two exceptions, these chapters correspond to the 20 committees that existed at the beginning of the 90th Congress, and also contain descriptions of the records of predecessor committees or other records that are related in some way. Chapters 22 through 24 describe the records of the select committees of  the House, the records of joint committees of Congress, and the general records of the House from 1789 through 1968. Chapter 25 continues the descriptions of the preceding chapters for the period 1969 to 1988. It contains a brief survey of the major series of records that have been retired by the committees. Appendices list speakers, majority leaders, clerks, beginning and ending dates for each Congress, a glossary of legislative and archival terms used in the guide, a selected bibliography, a list of published and unpublished finding aids to House records, and a list of National Archives microfilm publications of House records.
