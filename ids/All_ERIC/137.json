        "description":"The Career Maturity Inventory (CMI) has been used by some school districts to study the career development of high school students, as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of the career education project. Two questions which were raised about the selection of the CMI evolved into the objectives of this research. Those questions were: (1) Do counselor ratings of students' career knowledge, career planning, and attitude toward work correlate with those concepts as measured by the CMI?; and (2) Are the students of the CMI measuring independent factors of career maturity or are they so highly intercorrelated that they measure only one or two factors? One hundred eleven tenth-grade students were given the CMI, and four counselors were asked to rate each student on three  factors--concepts of knowing about jobs, looking ahead and attitudes toward work. Results of the study showed that the CMI subtests were highly interrelated, and that, while the counselor's ratings of students' career maturity correlated significantly, the relationship between what the counselors measured and what the CMI measured were not highly related at all.

        "description":"The rapid pace at which societal changes have occurred in our culture has presented a tremendous challenge to higher education. A major attempt to meet this challenge has been the Tomorrow's Higher Education (THE) Project. The goal of the THE Project is to reconceptualize student affaris work in a way that will provide a measure of creative input from the student affairs profession toward the shaping of post-secondary education for the future. Student development specialists can identify their own counseling/life style as Experiential-Gestalt and clearly recognize how Experiential-Gestalt philosophy and process can contribute to the goals presented the THE Project and facilitate the student development specialist in fulfilling their functions. This paper briefly reviews the  concepts of student development, specifically those which are summarized by the THE Project Statement. It offers a brief review of Experiential-Gestalt Therapy, relating the concepts to the THE Project Statement. A section is devoted to the Student Development Specialist. As A Model utilizing the skills and behavior of the Experiential-Gestalt therapist/person. And finally, it explores specific Experiential-Gestalt methods found useful in facilitating the development of college students. (Author)",

The author imagines hugging or touching someone, daydreams about sitting on a bench or riverbank, visualizes standing up during a boring meeting and shouting &quot;let's wake up and do something!&quot; Fantasy is also a tool that can be used in experimenting with new behavior, becoming more aware of experience, and as a therapeutic technique. Fantasy provides a creative stage on which to explore unlimited potentials. The author identifies his own counseling style as Experiential-Gestalt and discovers that fantasy is the most creative and powerful technique available to him. In this paper, he briefly shares some basics of Experiential Gestalt therapy, and describes how fantasy relates to these principles. Then he presents some ways that he  uses fantasy in his own life, as well as how fantasy contributes to counseling relationships in which he is involved. (Author)",

        "author":["Shapiro, Deane H., Jr."],
        "description":"An attempt is made to understand the behaviors involved in two different self-control strategies: Zen meditation and behavioral self-management. The first technique is derived from the Eastern &quot;religious-Philosophical&quot; tradition of Zen Buddhism; the other technique is derived from laboratory and field studies in Western settings. Using tools of naturalistic observation and experimental analysis, Zen meditation is conceptualized as a sequence of behaviors involving certain cues and consequences, and thereby being under explicit contingency arrangements. The same tools of experimental analysis are then applied to the behavioral self-management techniques, and a series of comparisons and contrasts are made between the two. After briefly reviewing the clinical outcome literature for  both strategies, the paper concludes with a discussion of the rehabilitative and preventive benefits which may be gained from a combination of the two techniques.

The course format included lectures, personal projects and group interaction, as well as reading and discussing the basic concepts of behavioral modification. Specific techniques developed and carried out by class members included identifying specific target behaviors, self-monitoring, making appropriate environmental changes and arranging for self-imposed consequences. Each student made a behavioral contract each week and reported to the class on results. From the authors' experience to date, it would seem that a behavioral self-control class has both remedial as well as developmental/preventive capabilities.  College students were able to use the experience to execute positive changes in what would be considered normal life problems. The authors discuss other uses for such classes in the mental health areas. (Author/PC)",

Two types of approaches to organizing cross-age helping programs are reviewed: (1) one emphasizes a programmed or structured approach which consists of a series of detailed steps for the tutor to follow with his tutee; (2) the other emphasizes an open, more flexible relationship between older and younger. Ingredients necessary for a successful cross-age helping program are discussed, as well as an anecdotal evaluation of this type of program in a pilot study. A second paper included with this document suggests types of designs which have worked well in cross-age helping programs. (Author/PC)",

What is necessary in a women's affirmative action plan for AERA is a statement of commitment to equal opportunity for women to participate in the association, and this commitment must be detailed through policies covering the main categories of associational activities. To accomplish a complete women's affirmative action plan, a full-time women's affirmative action officer should be appointed. AERA thus has a role to play in instituting women's affirmative action plans for the educational  research training and/or research organization to which its members belong. (Author/PC)",

Three studies were carried out in urban, parochial schools and were analyzed together. A rural school study was discussed separately. The major strategies instrumental in each of the four studies included: (1) feedback through test analysis, teacher attention, parental support; (2) social contact exercise, teacher attention, videofeedback; (3) existential group work, teacher attention; and (4) social contact exercise, process learning. Three analyses (analysis of variance, aptitude x treatment interaction, gain scores) were used to interpret the results of the four studies. A lower disruptive score or fewer negative teacher ratings were  considered desirable directions of change in student behavior. Generally, for boys and girls, the comparisons of absolute gains showed that Group I and III strategies were about equally effective, but that Group II strategies lowered the selected scale scores. Suggestions for further research are discussed. (Author/PC)",

The maintenance, not affirmation, of the bargainer's social face may facilitate his reaching agreement.

A group designated as V had extremely high verbal scores and very low quantitative scores; a Q group was at the opposite extreme--high in quantitative, low in verbal aptitude. Two non-discrepant groups were also studied: one, designated H, was very high in both aptitudes; another, designated A, was average in both. Analysis of data indicated that low verbal aptitude in particular was associated with low college grades. Attitudes toward literature and mathematics were clearly related to aptitude discrepancy. Marks in these two subjects began  to become disparate as early as elementary school and tended to diverge further through school. School-related factors were more often cited for shifts in attitude toward mathematics than toward literature. In the course of their development, the V- and Q-groups were found to be less like each other than like the H- and A-groups. (Author/PC)",

It is the authors' hypothesis that narcotics use is one of several interrelated social responses to labor market failure. What exactly has constituted this \"failure\" has varied from episode to episode in the growth of widespread narcotics use in American society. The authors develop the argument that the labor market primes the flow of working-class adolescents into a hypothetical hustler pool. This typically happens when, in conditions of high unemployment and absolute reductions in or deflation of the value of welfare payments, the only remaining income-earning alternative is in the criminal labor market,  otherwise known as the hustle. Once society realizes that not only is the socioeconomic pattern of narcotics use the same as it was a century ago, but that the problem of widespread addiction is a recurrent and cyclical one, it will be forced to examine the social constants which have operated in each case or episode in the cycle. This report is intended as a first statement of what these constants are and how they work. (Author)",

The package contains an introduction followed by a summary of techniques of assessing student performance, a description of current reading programs and reading evaluation methods, an analysis of teacher performance, and an inventory of available resources. The Arizona program directly involves parents and staff in determining priorities of reading needs and objectives, and employs a basic approach that will lead to attainment of these objectives. The manual also reviews and selects alternative methods, materials, and program organization, and it redirects existing resources to support the  new program. Information capsules are included for involving parents and staff in reviewing national model programs and identifying new practices that are applicable. (SW)",

The study schools were identified by gathering poverty data on the proportion of the attending students who received free lunch or free milk and the proportion of children in the attendance areas who were from low income families. Each measure of poverty was used to rank elementary schools in ten Massachusetts cities, and the average of the two rank values was used as the final ranking from high to low poverty. Average test scores in reading were added to the ranked list of schools in order to identify those poverty schools whose students read at or above grade level. Successful schools were also identified and matched with another school on the two poverty  measures. The project staff drew upon eight factors identified by George Weber to provide labels for the following factors: leadership, coordination, additional reading personnel, atmosphere, individualization, evaluation, high expectations, strong emphasis on reading, use of phonics, staff training and experience, and quality of teaching. The analysis of data failed to uncover consistent differences between the ratings of the two groups of schools. (WR)",

Findings indicated a significant positive relationship between reading achievement and attention for both boys and girls. Those students who had the higher reading achievement scores had the higher scores on attention, and those students who had the lower reading achievement scores had the lower attention scores. The role of IQ in attention and reading achievement was less clearly  defined. The data indicated that the relationship between IQ and reading achievement was not significant for boys but that it was significant for girls. In addition, the relationship between IQ and attention was not significant for boys but it was significant for girls.

A TLU states the objective the child will work toward, lists the materials he or she will use, and prescribes the activities he or she will perform in order to achieve the  objective. Some learning activities require students to work in small groups, while others require them to work alone.

        "description":"There are three main reasons why reading research has not had a stronger influence on what goes on in schools. The first reason is the powerful impact of social forces such as the bandwagon effect, the pendulum swing, and the prevailing climate of opinion. These factors determine to an unfortunately large degree whether or not particular research results will be accepted as guides to practice. The second reason the impact of reading research on practice is limited is that the lines of communication between researcher and practitioner are not open. The third reason the potential effect of research on practice is diminished is that much of the published research on reading is of quite limited value. This paper recommends that several research studies be done on current  controversial issues, including perceptual and perceptual-motor training, teaching reading skills, and training deficient abilities. It is suggested that a major service to the improvement of reading instruction would be to make all authoritative summaries of research accessible through widely published annotated bibliographies and Federal programs such as ERIC.

        "description":"There are increasing numbers of nontraditional students with atypical learning problems, life styles, and ambitions appearing in the academic establishment, and the number is likely to grow during the next five years. Studies consistently confirm the success of treating the nontraditional student and thereby bringing about desired and desirable behavioral changes in individuals who were once thought to be unreasonably difficult, uneducable, incompetent, and even hopeless. The handicapped can be helped to lead rewarding and productive lives, the elderly can acquire new skills and find valuable outlets for these skills, and the mentally retarded may, in fact, according to recent research, be able to learn to read. In order to meet the needs of the new students, the following  changes are likely to occur in education: concepts of instructional time and timing will change to accommodate more mini-courses, modular instruction, and short courses; the concept of learning space and facilities will change, especially to serve many students pursuing an external degree in off-campus situations; and management of human resources will become more adequate.

Classes run throughout the school  year; if a student reaches grade level by midyear, he or she leaves the program and is replaced by another pupil needing help. Materials used in the program are not used in the regular classroom, and the special reading teacher coordinates each child's work with the classroom teacher, who receives the child's diagnostic test profile.

The results of diagnostic tests administered to all seventh graders are used to write individualized educational prescriptions for each student. Prescriptions are flexible and provide the student with a choice of materials and media that concentrate on each key reading skill. The prescriptions are kept with individual progress sheets in the reading laboratory, where the members of each seventh-grade class work with their English teacher and two reading specialists for 45 minutes each week. Students with severe reading deficiencies come to the reading lab for  additional 30-minute periods each day and continue working from their prescriptions. The eigth-grade phase combines a multimedia approach with work in a reading lab. Procedures and instructional activities of this component are similar to those in the seventh-grade lab.

The paper consists of five sections. The first section discusses the interconnection of social, geographic, and stylistic variations, and stresses that reading and writing are both secondary to spoken language. The second section discusses various theoretical problems, focusing on the status of Black English and Anglo English as dialects of American English. The third section considers the pedagogical relevance of sociolinguistic data and discusses deep structure and surface structure. The fourth section discusses field methods and analysis procedures to  determine the linguistic competence of an individual or a group.

It is postulated that the major problem in reading words of more than one syllable is stress and its effect on vowel pronunciation. It is also reasonable to assume that words become more difficult to read as they become longer. In words of more than one syllable there is less consistency in their spelling-to-sound correspondences. A strategy is included for the ordered introduction of two-syllable words in reading in the following six steps: (1) one-syllable words with one-syllable inflectional suffixes, (2) two-syllable compounds with first syllable primary stress, (3) two-syllable words with both syllables receiving  stress and thus both vowels conforming to previously learned spelling-to-sound correspondences, (4) two-syllable words with the common endings \"y\" and \"le\", (5) two-syllable words with stress on the first syllable and an unstressed vowel in the second, and (6) steps 2, 3, and 5 with primary stress on the second syllable.

The children were given measures of vocabulary, sentence imitation, comprehension and production, phoneme discrimination, IQ, and word inflection skill at age three. In addition, the children's mothers were assessed for verbal IQ and speech style. At age six, measures which included those administered at age three, as well as field independence-dependence, reading readiness, and reading skill, were given to the children. Significant correlations were found between age-three and age-six scores, and between home and maternal measures and age-six scores.

The new theory integrates earlier proposals within a single framework, sacrificing none of the predictive power of the earlier proposals, but offering a gain in theoretical economy. The theory holds that word recognition is accomplished by filtering visual feature information from the printed word through a hierarchy of letter, letter-cluster, and word detectors. The detectors are Bayesian decision devices which estimate the likelihood of the presence of their target configurations by combining information from lower detectors with a priori knowledge about the structure of words in English. In addition, several empirical studies on issues related to the theory were  conducted. Two of these studies demonstrated that skilled readers draw visual information from all the letters in a word at once, rather than from one letter at a time; and that statistical co-occurance of letter sequences affects the perceptibility of those sequences, independent of their pronounceability. A third study, on whether covert pronunciation of words is necessary to apprehend their meaning, proved inconclusive. (Author/WR)",

Affective components are present in the student, in the subject matter, and in the relationship between the two. Affect and cognition can be brought into meaningful relationship or \"confluence\" in classroom lessons which teach reading and writing. Processes which may be used to accomplish this goal include group dynamics and Gestalt awareness exercises. The tools to be used in achieving confluence are reading and writing, the materials are standard curriculum materials, and the interests and concerns are those of students. These methods were used in a reading/writing fundamentals curriculum for a group of low-achieving students during a six-week summer session at a community  college. A control group was given a curriculum which was identical except that the affective component was not intentionally structured. Pretests and posttests were administered to both groups. In comparison with the control group, the treatment group showed improvements in reading comprehension, work methods, and teacher approval, as well as significant improvements in self-concept. It is concluded, therefore, that it is possible to develop both learning skills and human potential within the same curriculum. (LL)",

At the sixth-grade achievement level in the student's individual program, reading widely, discussing what has been read, and learning techniques to increase  reading comprehension are stressed.

Decoding skills are taught phonetically, using a vowel code to unlock the sound of a word. Strong emphasis is given to comprehension and vocabulary growth. Dictation techniques are used to provide oral readiness at each step; students are then able to work independently on materials based on the sounds and words introduced. Materials include a teacher's manual, dictation record, sound and word cards, student workbooks, reading books,  and tests. The program also utilizes library books and regular basal readers. The program is divided into five levels. The focus at levels one and two is on decoding of words with oral preparation for reading comprehension and creativity; at level three, on reading comprehension and sentence writing; and at level four, on spelling and creative writing.

No significant difference was found between fast and slow readers in either recognition or retrieval. High comprehension children had significantly lower recognition thresholds and retrieval times than the low comprehenders. In all analyses, high-frequency words had lower recognition thresholds and retrieval times than low-frequency words. Length of word had a significant effect only on retrieval time; the longer words took more time to retrieve. A significant interaction between word length and reading ability on the retrieval task suggests an important locus of difficulty for poor readers  in the processing of long words. (Author)",

Children selected for this program show a deficit in reading achievement equivalent to one and one-half years or more. The program began in 1971 and focuses on strengthening reading, vocabulary, and communication skills through the addition of nontraditional settings for instruction and the extension of the school year through July. Organized into six segments, each six-week segment includes four weeks of traditional classroom instruction, one week of special instruction at one of several community  cultural institutions, and one week of vacation. Integrated into the regular classroom curriculum is time for the children to write about their experiences at the cultural institutions. The students are encouraged to use their new vocabulary in diary entries, and to learn to read by augmenting reading lessons with writing. In addition to planning activities, teachers schedule parent conferences and tutor students during the one-week vacation periods. (RB/AIR)",

Using the Informal Reading Inventory, a random sample of twenty-five second graders and twenty-five fifth graders was taken from three middle-class metropolitan schools. The types of word recognition errors were classified according to criteria the researcher had established and then converted into proportions. Differences between the second- and fifth-grade subjects' errors were tested at the .01 level using the z test. The results indicated that second and fifth graders made similar types of word recognition errors during oral reading, with the following exceptions:  (1) second graders had more words given by the examiner, (2) fifth graders confused the initial consonant more frequently, and (3) fifth graders made more meaningless guesses. Both groups tended to use initial clues combined with syntax and semantics as a primary aid to word recognition. (Author/LL)",

After 144 fifth-grade children were presented with twelve short acquisition stories, they were asked to discriminate between true and false premise or inference recognition test sentences. Performance varied as a function of experimental condition, and discrimination for correct premises was much better than that for correct inferences. No consistent support was found for a view of constructive memory in children. (Author)",

One instrument which may prove useful toward this end is the cloze test, an informal reading comprehension measurement in which a message is mutilated by deleting certain words and substituting underlined black spaces of constant length. The main thesis of this paper is that cloze analysis of individual student responses on such a test may yield more precise information than current procedures provide for secondary and community college instructors about the strengths and weaknesses  of students in specific language skills areas as well as their attitudes toward the subject matter. The paper discusses the use of the cloze test and provides examples and statistics to support the main thesis. (RB)",

While LC reduces the number of elements per word, it also reduces the number of words that can be generated. LC eliminates distortion in the final vowel-consonant elements; but it allows distortion in the initial consonant, which may be a more serious problem. Although LC places vowel letters in a pronunciation-determining environment, environmental constraints are much more complex and may cover at least the whole word. The analysis suggests that the LC approach is probably not maximally appropriate for either reading or spelling instruction and that individual grapheme units and sounds can be  best analyzed and synthesized within whole words.

In the first experiment, kindergarten children practiced visually discriminating whole words (big, pig, dig), single letters (b, p, d), or geometric forms (triangle, circle, square) before learning to read three words (big, dig, pig). The children having whole word discrimination read the words more accurately than those under other conditions. The purpose of the second experiment was to determine if spelling patterns also operate in recognizing isolated words. The experiment involved a same-different reaction-time design in which second graders decided if a word semantically matched a picture. The words were typed with spaces that either preserved possible  spelling patterns (bl ast) or were inconsistent with proposed units (b last). Reaction time to the \"bl ast\" condition was approximately 300 milliseconds faster than to the \"b last\" stimuli. No differences in reaction time occurred between the control (blast) and \"bl ast\" conditions. Both experiments showed that units larger than single letters seem to be used by children in word recognition. (Author)",

Furthermore, college reading instruction, to ensure its own future, has to develop a corpus of specialized training courses which recognize that college reading teachers are often not working in a classroom situation. The results of a recent survey of graduate programs in reading and of  college reading specialists show that schools of education generally see no difference between teaching reading at various educational levels, whereas college reading specialists do see a difference.

An adult who wishes to enter the program first has an interview with one of the reading counselors, who attempts to identify the person's reason for coming to the program and to translate it into a specific educational goal. Counselors continue to give educational and vocational guidance throughout a student's participation in the program. After the initial counseling, the student meets with the instructor, who starts a folder in which all of the student's work is recorded. The student can then begin to work independently  whenever he or she comes to the center, and the instructor can give help when needed. Those who read at a fourth-grade level or lower, work in small groups or individually with more teacher supervision.

Causes of students' negative attitudes toward reading include the following: flexible grouping which turns out to be inflexible; teachers' selecting the books students have to read; and the requiring of book reports on everything read. Remedial students need counseling, and they need to establish personal relationships as much as they need remedial or corrective reading. Once the teacher learns to express a positive attitude toward the student as an individual, the student's self-concept begins to be reshaped in a positive way. At this point teachers may start to select materials and methods that are consistent with the needs of the students.  (RB)",

What English teachers must encourage in their students is creativity. The creative process involves having a problem or need, considering what alternatives are available, deciding on a course of action and following it, and getting feedback in order to evaluate the result. The following six general guidelines are listed: students must be made comfortable in the classroom surroundings; students cannot fear the teacher, fellow students, or self; teachers should  help students feel a reason to read, write, listen, and speak effectively and imaginatively; students should understand clearly what is expected in the class; teachers should provide a variety of learning experiences; and students deserve an audience besides the teacher for their efforts with opportunities for feedback. Included are a list of ingredients vital to the creative process, some guidelines for a creative classroom atomsphere, and a list of creative activities. (TS)",

The year's program was structured into eight sections, each section having a particular theme which was presented four times to four different groups of teachers. Three full-day sessions and five half-day sessions were held during the year. Government monies paid for the released time for teacher attendance. Attendance at the first workshop was mandatory; all subsequent attendance was  voluntary. The basic philosophy of CATS was to offer alternative strategies and action techniques that had been proven effective on a cross discipline and cross grade level.

The National Assessment gave rise to the development of statewide testing programs. Currently, there are bills under consideration in most state legislatures for &quot;systems approaches&quot; to accountability; as a result, teachers throughout the country are being asked by their state departments of education, by regional accrediting associations, and by school districts to develop a performance-based curriculum in English. It is suggested that  a problem exists in this type of curriculum in that it is geared not to meet the needs of the individual student, or even of groups of students, but rather to obtain consistency in state and nationwide educational achievement as evidenced by testing. It is further suggested that English teachers are becoming more aware of the significance of testing and measurement in the English curriculum, and that through this awareness, a new potential of the National Assessment may be realized.

The first study explored a large number of BE pronunciation features. The second included control features that do not have differing pronunciations in BE and standard English (SE). The third examined final consonant clusters only. The studies indicate that differences exist in the degree to which various features of BE pronunciation are associated with BE-related spelling errors. Moreover, feature difficulty in terms of BE-related errors is not what might be expected on the basis of speech data. BE-related errors are more frequently made on grammatical than on nongrammatical features, and SE speakers make many of the same BE-related errors that BE speakers  make, but less frequently. Appendixes containing materials and tables related to the three studies are included. (Author/JM)",

Few surveys, however, have questioned whether investigators intended the same, or different, definitions for creativity. Although as many as 26 distinct definitions have been identified, this review of creativity research divides the definitions into two areas--the behavioristic (which identifies creativity with novelty and originality) and the existential (which associates creativity with genius). It is concluded in this review of the literature that the behavioristic-existentialistic dichotomy derived by Stark (1965) is useful when applied to the psychological literature, but it is  questionable whether or not Stark's discussion truly reflects all the differences in conceptions of creativity.

The third experiment showed that black children use more Black English forms in retelling exciting stories than in retelling academic material.

In the model presented, the basal component of the grammar generates constructs which consist of a modality index and a proposition. The proposition consists of related basal constituents and their respective semantic roles. The operative component assigns grammatical functions to basals, categorizes them as  nouns, verbs, etc., supplies syntactic features and functions, and determines the sequential order of elements in overt sentences. The expressive component contains phonological elements and rules. (Author/TS)",

In either case, its linguistic categorizations shape perceptions and feelings about problematic and controversial public issues, reflecting and playing upon the ambivalence and changing perspectives of all who are involved. Categorization can engender cognitions that are dogmatic or tentative; perceptions of inhuman enemies or of adversaries that can best be handled through the seeking out of dissonant information; sensations that are perceived as factual propositions; beliefs that are unconsciously taken for granted; and facts that are reconstructed into different facts. Such evocations follow consistent rules of cognitive structuring, only some of which  can be specified.

Care and time should be taken in preparing listening instruction, with special attention given to students' individual needs and interests.

A report of a survey on standardized testing in New York State sets the scene, demonstrating that English teachers feel a need for test information, and pointing up the necessity for educating the general public in the proper use of test scores. The articles that follow define terms used in testing and discuss the issues. Questions are raised about some of the tests in wide use throughout the state of New York, and several articles offer alternatives to traditional ways of evaluating reading and writing. The  emphasis section concludes with a recent sources bibliography on measuring growth in English. The general articles contained in this issue discuss the heterogeneous grouping of high school students, the various uses of the cloze technique in the teaching of English as a second language, Robert Frost's \"The Road Not Taken,\" the development of a competency-based English curriculum in kindergarten through grade twelve, and the advantages of using improvisation in the English class.

Telephone interview data were collected from 82 voter registrants on the Connecticut races for governor and state representative. Newspaper content analysis was made for three Connecticut races: governor, state senator, and state representative. The results indicated that there were great differences in the perceived honesty and fairness in favor of women as opposed to men in politics.  The issues raised in two of the three races studied showed no apparent sex-related influence. Furthermore, no sex-related voting patterns were apparent. The results further suggest that women are viable candidates who can run and win on an equal basis with men and that in the past they have lacked opportunities rather than qualifications. (LL)",

Following an explanation of the concept of factor analysis, the bulk of this paper describes the application of factor analysis in speech and communication research. The basic considerations involved in this statistical technique are defining an area of concern or a concept to investigate, constructing a number  of items to measure the concept, collecting responses to the items, calculating a correlation matrix of the responses, and factor analyzing the correlation matrix.

The subjects for the study were eleven educational administrators who participated in a twenty-contact-hours simulation training program from which fifteen role-simulation dyadic episodes were videotaped.

Concentrating on programs administered by the U.S. Office of Education (USOE), the handbook is designed to show the numerous, wide-ranging services open for pupils and teachers in private schools, with emphasis on congressional mandates for their participation that were written in the Education Amendments of 1974. It provides a brief survey of the legal and judicial  background for providing public funds for services for children enrolled in private schools. It defines the opportunities for and responsibilities of private school administrators and explores the relationships that must be established and maintained between the private school head and the public educational sector if there is to be effective participation in federal education programs.

        "description":"This report summarizes and draws implications from a two-year pilot program in which 12 elementary school principals received training designed to help them become more effective leaders in their own school settings. The goal of the program was to enable participating principals to define and enact the leadership roles best suited to their particular leadership styles, the needs of their schools, and the concept of the educational leader as a humanistic change agent. In addition, the program was intended to provide data relevant to the selection and training of principals and to study the leadership functions and personal competencies necessary for the creation of an effective elementary school. Individual chapters of the report discuss the program design, competence and growth  of participating principals, change in the participating schools, an analysis of training activities, and various implications and recommendations resulting from the program.

The author argues that the grounds for nonrenewal, dismissal, or demotion of school administrators should be clearly articulated and recommends adoption of his Administrator's Bill of Rights at all levels of the education profession.

The author focuses his attention on HR 8677, which would create a federal commission to regulate public employer-employee relations, and HR 77, which would place all public employees under jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Act. Passage of either bill is unacceptable, the author feels, because it would allow a federal agency to preempt the authority of elected state and local government officials. For the public schools, such a law would cause even more damage, he argues, by unduly broadening the scope of collective negotiations and by undermining the traditional  distinction in employment matters between teachers and administrative personnel.

Information about the field operations and role perceptions of various state agencies was gathered through use of a self-administered questionnaire and through meetings and interviews with top staff members of major state agencies. The study is organized into three chapters. Chapter 1 discusses the changing concepts of federalism and decentralization, and outlines the basic lexicon used in studying decentralization. Chapter 2 discusses the objectives and methodology of the study and reports on the models of authority delegation found in different agencies.  Chapter 3 examines the findings, evaluates each decentralization model, and offers some suggestions for the organization of regional activities. (Author/JG)",

In most provinces, the major church-related school systems receive financial support from the province. A second difference is that Canadian provincial authorities have guarded their autonomy jealously, which results in strong provincial departments of education, relatively weak local systems, and minimal federal influence on education. There is no Canadian equivalent of the U.S. Office of Education or the National Institute of Education. As in the United States, educational finance is a policy issue of considerable importance in Canada. With the exception of New Brunswick, all  provinces rely on a combination of municipal and provincial fiscal support, though the relationship between these funding sources varies considerably from province to province. However, variability in school support within each province is considerably less than in most states in the United States. (Author/JG)",

An index measures price differences among school districts, and a first attempt is made to go beyond a simple cost-of-living index to adjust for district cost differences associated with location. The third paper explores special urban aid factors in state school aid formulas for selected cities with municipal overburdens. The effects of tax exporting on local taxes,  urban school aid factors, and tax burdens of various school finance reforms are analyzed.

Being concerned with choice and action--its methods leading to defensible decisions--international education contrasts with comparative education, which is more concerned with knowledge leading to warranted conclusions. Emerging from the research is agreement that comparative education can contribute to the understanding of education and its planned development, even if comparative education as a scientific field of inquiry remains an open question. More attention should be given to the academic base of comparative education, focusing on mutually interdependent development of conceptual,  theoretical, methodological, and data bases that may be directed toward a range of issues and activities. The future of the Comparative and International Education Society will determine the future of comparative and international education. (Author/DW)",

In most cases, the disciplinarian may informally discuss the alleged misconduct with the student minutes after it has occurred.&quot; The Court also emphasized that &quot;longer suspensions or expulsions . . . may require more formal procedures.&quot; In Wood v. Strickland, the Court ruled that, although school board members are entitled to a &quot;qualified&quot; privilege against damages for wrongful acts  committed while acting in good faith, they are not protected against damages if they knew, or reasonably should have known, that their actions would violtate the constitutional rights of a student. However, the Court stressed that a mere mistake in carrying out his duties should not make a board member liable.

It is intended to supplement the implementation manuals that usually accompany new instructional programs to aid school district personnel in successfully implementing new instructional programs. The publication consists of a brief introduction and three main sections. The Overview of the Project Management Process section defines the concept of project and describes the basic activities involved in the project management process. The Management of an Implementation Project section defines the concept of an implementation project and discusses all the activities involved in the four phases of an implementation project. The Conclusion  briefly summarizes the content of the previous sections and suggests sources of additional information or assistance regarding the management of an implementation project.

Criteria considered were schedule, cost, quality/performance, follow-onwork, spin-of benefits, customer/client satisfaction, and overall project success. Two hundred and six people associated with a sample of 146 educational projects first ranked the criteria and then rated their own projects accordingly. A number of diagrams graphically present the relative importance of the various criteria as perceived by different groups of respondents. Findings of the study showed that achieving project objectives was considered most important and meeting time and cost constraints was considered rather unimportant in  determining the success of projects.

We know that dissemination is in itself a science; our strategy is based on the belief that successful adoption of an innovation requires certain generic skills distinctly different from the skills related to a specific innovation. We are examining decision-making processes in school districts and state education departments to develop a change capability that can initiate and sustain educational improvements from the district level to the building level. To accomplish this aim, the following strategies have been utilized: establishment of criteria to ensure commitment and understanding about R&D products as instructional systems; development of training programs for administrators,  teachers, and school district central office personnel; establishment of demonstration centers with national representation; development of a data network and feedback system that permits the monitoring of schools; and inclusion of state education agencies and central office administrators in the development of a capability for introducing and maintaining educational innovations.

Despite two decades of ferment and innovation, the instruction of most students has been affected little, if at all. Local change programs in education tend to be those that make the most apparent change with the least actual change. Planned educational change should begin with decisions about the aims of education. Once goals have been set, planning instruction is a matter of employing instructional resources to enable students to achieve the selected goals. Very little research attention has been paid to the implementation of change programs. Future research on educational change should focus on changes that are  consumer-referenced rather than product-referenced, emphasize how local education agencies can learn to plan and conduct significant change programs, focus on the needs and aims of local education agencies, emphasize the process of implementation in studies of local change programs, draw on principles and research from outside education only when they are clearly applicable, and stress outcomes that are fundamental to the educational process.

Each case is examined according to its objectives (single or multiple), resource level (limited or unlimited), time frame (a priori or evaluative), and the nature of desired decisions. In cases 1, 2, and 3, the decision-maker considers activity-designs. The complexity of cases 4, 5, and 6 mandates more detailed analysis. Here the notions of tasks and program-packages (sets of tasks) are introduced. In cases 7, 8, and 9, the term activity is used to connote the same overall meaning as program-package. These distinctions are necessitated by analytic complexities arising out of a need to derive an optimal decision-variable for  each case. Decisions made by the decision-maker are at the level of activity-design for cases 1 and 2, program-package for cases 4 and 5, and activity for cases 7 and 8. The case discussion is preceded by an introductory exhibit showing the evolutionary structure of the nine cases. (Author)",

The administrative organization was changed to a superintendency team, and a comprehensive planning system was installed. The change process is presented historically as moving from the schoolmaster mode to the specialist teaching in a child-centered organizational mode. E.S.E.A., Title IV is cited as a major force for educational change through  initiation of research and development centers. To accomplish planned educational change, it is said that an outside change agent is required and that administrators must be trained to administer the change process. (DW)",

Low-income families in both states were found to be in districts of low per-pupil-Expenditures and inferior educational services primarily because they are located in districts with low property valuations. Mexican-American pupils in Texas tend to be ethnically isolated in low-wealth districts and have fewer educational resources available to them than do Anglo pupils. Important differences were found between Texas and California in regard to ethnic isolation. Since Mexican-American pupils in California are not concentrated in predominantly ethnic districts, not much interethnic disparity in the distribution of  educational resources among districts was found. Black pupils in both Texas and California are concentrated in large urban centers where expenditures are generally at or above the state average. These findings, however, do not take into consideration cost differentials between urban and nonurban areas and municipal overburden. The hypothesis that black pupils in large urban districts are disadvantaged by intradistrict inequalities is offered for further research. (Author/IRT)",

The case-study sites represent a variety of project objectives and local district conditions. The studies were limited to five types of innovations: career education, bilingual education, reading, staff development, and classroom organization. In the organization of the report, the process of innovation is characterized by three  phases: initiation, implementation, and outcomes. Each area is given a chapter of the report. The outcomes of interest to this study are the effects of the project on classrooms, teachers, and students; the extent to which the project treatments were continued after the special project funding ended; and the amount of dissemination that took place between the project schools and nonproject schools within the local education agency and in other districts.

Section 1 describes the origins and the planning and management strategies that the United States Office of Education (USOE) adopted for Title III, both in the state plan program, which is administered by state departments of education, and in the smaller federally funded programs, which USOE administers directly. Section 2 describes the role of state education agencies in Title III. Section 3  presents syntheses of the fieldwork case studies. In examining Title III, the researchers decided to focus on projects that were reputed to be successful in one of two particularly difficult aspects of reform: classroom organization, which generally implies a shift in classroom practice toward concepts of open education; and staff development, which often aims at important changes in teacher behavior. Section 4 presents the individual case studies. (Author)",

Section 2 describes the theoretical approach that served as the basis for data collection and analysis. Sections 3 and 4, respectively, present findings about the innovative process and about the factors affecting implementation and continuation. These sections do not present the actual analyses but use footnotes to refer to evidence presented in the other volumes. Section 5 goes beyond immediate data to raise questions about the policy instruments used in federal change agent programs. These policy implications are tentative for several  reasons. First, this report presents only the findings of the first year of a two-phase study. Second, this is exploratory research--in effect the work consists of hypotheses that require more refined testing. Nonetheless, since policy can seldom afford the slow pace of scientific confirmation, conclusions supported by both the evidence and experience are offered. (Author)",

        "description":"Under the sponsorship of the U. S. Office of Education, Rand is conducting a several-year study of federally funded programs designed to introduce and spread innovative practices in public schools. These change agent programs normally offer temporary federal funding to school districts as &quot;seed money&quot; or &quot;risk capital.&quot; If an innovation is successful, it is assumed that the district will continue part or all of the project using other sources of funds, and also disseminate it to other schools in the district, as well as to other districts that may be seeking change. The Rand study examines four such federal programs--Elementary and Secondary Education Act Title III, Innovative Projects; Elementary and Secondary Education Act Title VII, Bilingual Projects; Vocational Education  Act, 1968 Amendments, Part D, Exemplary Programs; and the Right-To-Read Program. The study identifies what tends to promote various kinds of changes in the schools and what doesn't. In particular, the Rand study will identify for federal, state, and local policy makers the nature, permanence, and extent of dissemination of innovations that are associated with the various federal programs and with various federal, state, and local practices. This part tries to distill the study's methods and results for a general audience. (Author)",

The discussion is related to planning, developing, and operating one or more of the three major components of an MIS: (1) an output component that has the major task of delivering information to decision-makers so that their decisions are affected; (2) a data management or data processing component where classifications, storage, and analysis of various types occur, and from which manipulated data is retrieved; and (3) the input or data collection component system that collects and feeds in raw data.  The report discusses the information requirements of various offices in HEW, information systems needs within NIE, and questions and options related to MIS planning. A plan is suggested for the 12 to 15 months of MIS development. (Author/MLF)",

An Oregon statewide survey reporting teacher attitudes toward discipline suggests that needed changes include a greater conformity to established school regulations, revision of the Oregon compulsory attendance law, and the establishment of alternative schools for deviant youth. The administrator attitude, reported by a senior high school vice-principal, reflects concern over rising juvenile crime and the apparent inability of police, juvenile court, and education agencies to punish or deter juvenile offenders. Inconsistencies in state laws are said to contribute to the problem. The legal  perspective, reported by a school district attorney, suggests that due process is appropriate and necessary for protection of student rights, and that the law allows reasonable disciplinarey action and eventual expulsion for disruptive students.

Effective communications with state legislators, based on credibility, content, clarity, and currency in a face-to-face, one-on-one approach, are preferable to written communications. (Author/DW)",

The program developed a personnel pool of trainees including doctoral degree candidates and vice-principals working toward certification. Administrative internships were part of the training program. Fifty people who are currently vice-principals or administrative assistants are graduates of the program. The school district sees the program as worthwhile in meeting the needs of student unrest, racial confrontation, and underrepresentation of minority groups in leadership positions. (DW)",

A section containing the results of an opinion portion of the survey should also be of interest to the general readers. Two directory sections are included: one lists school districts reporting citizen participation activity, and one lists active citizen organizations. The participant groups are divided into two categories: Category 1 organizations are those whose role in educational decision-making is defined by the school district; Category 2 groups are private, nonprofit organizations not formally associated with the school system, but concerned with  educational policy and practice in a local school district. While there is evidence of quantitative increase--more groups and more activity--the survey has produced nothing that would indicate any important shift in the way that schools are governed. Much of what was learned about the participation of citizens in educational decision-making does, however, offer some cause for hope for the future. (Author/IRT)",

If negotiation is an adversary process between two powers, then there has to be a balance of power between the school board and union. Today unions have more actual and potential power than school management. Unions spend great sums of money preparing for negotiations and training negotiators. School districts also must spend money and learn to work together on the local, state, and national levels, or they will lose their rights to union whipsawing. Negotiation must be viewed as a continuous and permanent management function that requires careful advance planning. After a contract has been ratified, principals and supervisors will need inservice training on contract maintenance and labor relations. It is  of prime importance that the board have a well-written contract, especially those clauses dealing with board rights, grievance procedures, and bargaining unit representation. Unionized teachers hope to take power from school boards and the citizens they represent; to protect the rights of the board, taxpayers, and students of a school district demands serious attention and determination.

Brennan et al. that an unsuccessful college applicant may view the materials submitted by his high school to ensure that he is not misrepresented by unfair or malicious evaluations. However, Einhorn et al. v. Maus et al. sustained high school officials' right to release to colleges and universities pupil  records relating to nonacademic matters, and the court in People v. Russel ruled that college authorities may restrict public circulation of some school records. Wagner v. Redmond and King v. Ambellan established the right of school board members to inspect student records, where \"sufficient interest\" is shown.

Certain conclusions, nevertheless, can be drawn. Principals and all educators are faced with a question to which they must react. Whatever the case in the past, there is now undisputed knowledge that smoking is a causal factor in many injurious, debilitating, and often fatal diseases. Given this awareness, the question becomes whether or not to condone smoking on school premises (\"allow\" is not the proper term, as very often prevention is not within the practical power of the school principal). The National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP) suggests that student smoking lounges may well implicitly promote smoking in  the public schools. Therefore, in lieu of establishing them, NASSP suggests that intensive educational programs to inhibit and/or finally terminate smoking be instituted. NASSP also recognizes the imperative need to involve students, faculty, parents, and the community-at-large in deliberations on this sensitive subject. (Author)",

Fishing expeditions as a matter of school policy are not advised. A general search of all lockers in reaction to a bomb threat or widespread drug abuse can be justified as a proper exercise of school authority. A search, of course, may be made by a police officer with a  valid warrant or in connection with a valid arrest. If police are involved, however, parents should be notified and the principal or another school official should be present at the time of the search. In all instances, a complete report of the incident including names of witnesses and other pertinent information should be recorded immediately. One suggestion that can be drawn from these cases is that a school should publicize its locker policy. (Author)",

Generally, school administrators have been considered employees who serve at the pleasure of the school board, and school boards have been granted wide discretion in hiring and firing administrators. However, there is a trend toward extending teachers' constitutional guarantees to school administrators as well. Principals have something of an advantage over superintendents and supervisors in this regard, since principals historically have  been regarded as head teachers, rather than as agents of the school boards.

        "description":"While the status of the application of constitutional rights in public schools has become clearer because of court cases and statutes, the position of the private and parochial schools has remained vague. This paper examines the status of the private and parochial schools not only to determine how due-process requirements have been extended to schools, but also to show which schools fall under the constitutional requirement. The legal principles and precedents affecting this distinction should also help public school principals to understand the legal basis for their consitutional responsibilities. So far, few cases have been successfully brought against nonpublic schools or their administrators on the basis of depriving students or teachers of due process or other constitutional  rights. In making their decisions, courts have examined educational institutions for signs of governmental control or involvement. Most courts have not been convinced that contacts typically found, such as teacher certification, tax exemption, or financial aid to students in special programs, are sufficient to involve the application of the Fourteenth Amendment.

        "description":"Discrimination against women in public employment may soon be coming to an end. Since 1972, when the Equal Opportunity Act was expanded to include public schools, the cause of women's rights has been gaining momentum. Today, although there are no quotas for women and men in education, many districts are under affirmative action mandates to move toward full equality of women with men. The recent cases cited here lead to the conclusion that any difference in treatment between male and female teachers will be regarded as discrimination and vigorously prosecuted by the courts. Such differences in the standards applied to the conduct of teachers outside the classroom have opened up other questions related to sexual behavior and sexual choice by educators. The old common-law rules  permitted teachers to be held to high moral standards even in their out-of-school behavior on the theory that the teacher was a moral exemplar in the community. Recent decisions seem to indicate a departure from this rule, and its replacement by one holding that the only basis for dismissal of a teacher is conduct adversely affecting the capacity to perform his or her inschool duties.

The specific recommendations focus on the principalship; the superintendency; the district's planning, research, and assessment; the question of centralization versus decentralization; and the district's personnel  services. The advisory committee has developed four organizational plans for the district's consideration. Plan 1 is a modification of the present district structure. Plan 2 is a decentralized area or regional administrative organization with centralized functions. Plan 3 is a decentralized organization with modification of Plan 2 at the building and top administrative levels. Plan 4 is a centralized organization plan based on the organization recommended by the Washington study. The committee tended to lean toward a form of decentralization, essentially to get effective line supervision to a smaller number of school sites. (Author/IRT)",

        "description":"Many educational decisions are made on issues over which conflict occurs because of value differences among the groups involved. The decision-making model proposed here is a political or conflict model. It defines an organization as stable patterns of interactions between coalitions of groups having a collective identity and pursuing interests and accomplishing tasks, coordinated through a system of authority. The main value dilemmas faced by educational administrators focus on what constitutes leadership and on who commands the loyalty of the administrator. Leadership value conflicts center on developing commitment to organizational goals, reconciling personal and group goals, delegating responsibility and authority rather than abdicating them, continuing a concern with  organizational improvement rather than with mere survival, making decisions, and being both task-oriented and considerate. Loyalty--the most difficult, testing, and potentially damaging dilemma--involves three subissues: (1) professional loyalty conflicts between colleagues, collegial standards, and organizational standards and expectations; (2) intraprofessional and interprofessional conflicts; and (3) conflicts between professionals and laymen, and conflicts arising out of political disputes within and between communities and their elected representatives, the trustees.

Two analyses of the principal's conference skills were then added to the tape together with editorial comments on the analyses, and the tape was then returned to the principal. At the time of the report, twenty-three tapes from nine principals or other supervisors had been analyzed by two of thirteen analysts. When several tapes had been analyzed for the same principal with different teachers, the investigator, the two analysts, and the principal met to discuss the value of the analyses to the principal. In each case the principal said that the analyses were very useful and that it was helpful to have the two analyses rather than one.  There was no evidence in any of the tapes of conflict between the principal and the teacher. The conferences lasted between nine and thirty-five minutes, and no systematic methods of data analysis were made either by the principal or the analysts. Some principals and teachers pursued objectives in the conference that they agreed on in advance; others did not. The preliminary results of the feasibility study are encouraging, and further data are being collected and analyzed to continue the study. (Author)",

Eight instructional alternatives within three primary reading programs were studied in the Louisville Public Schools. Data collected covered program description and implementation, student characteristics, effectiveness measures, and costs. Program implementation data were used to adjust effectiveness measures. Students were grouped using characteristic data. By dividing the mean adjusted effectiveness measures by the per-pupil-program costs, a set of cost-effectiveness ratios was calculated that could be used to compare programs. The study generated information that indicates the possible feasibility of the approach. The utilization of three of the four data types suggested in  determining the cost-effectiveness of instructional programs was successfully implemented. The utilization of a fourth type, implementation data, was not adequately accomplished. Therefore, the feasibility of the approach was not completely demonstrated. However, the study does suggest a high likelihood of feasibility and has pinpointed areas of implementation difficulties. Hopefully, the results of this effort, both negative and positive, will assist in the development of a cost-effective methodology that can be used by the education practitioner. (Author)",

Administrative interns assigned to 40 New York City schools during the 1973-74 school year observed principals' decision-making behaviors over a continuous period of 40 school days. Principals' behaviors were described in terms of four categories linked to Griffith's decision-making theory. Based on Griffith's theory, it was predicted that principals who emphasized appellate (conflict resolution) decisions and intermediary (school management) decisions rather than creative (educational program and staff development) decisions would be likely to head schools with below-norm average reading achievement. Findings of the study showed that, on the average, the 40  principals devoted less than 10 percent of their time to creative matters. As predicted, 35 of the 40 schools reported 55 percent or more of their pupils with below-norm achievement scores. (JG)",

A year later, the center joined with the University of Minnesota and began to participate in new curriculum development at both the school and college level, blending preservice and inservice training. The unique aspect of the Minneapolis teacher centers is that the consumers (teachers, principals, or parents) determine to a great extent what they need to know and how they want to get it. By submitting a brief written proposal, they ask a governing board of teachers and parents for the money and means to get the desired training. This model encourages risk-taking, because no one has to admit a professional deficiency to those higher  in the administrative structure. Although the Teacher Center arranges for training, the training takes place in a variety of settings. Training is for varying periods of time, depending on the project. The Teacher Center serves as an influence agency for the development of the school's programs, but it has no controlling role over the administration of a given school. (Author/JG)",

The report analyzes problems raised by the design and construction of multioption schools and discusses the process of transforming theoretical models into practical buildings and equipment. The analysis emphasizes the need to base design projects and the briefing process on a study of the school's functions. In addition, the author examines ways to reconcile educational needs and various constraints through interdisciplinary cooperation, research and development, and teacher participation.

        "description":"Interest in extending the school year to make more efficient use of school facilities has been long standing. The most popular method of extending the school year is the summer session. Although widely popular with administrators, teachers, parents, and students, the summer session suffers from the same limitation as other extended school year plans--it costs more to operate than the regular year alone. The Lexington, Kentucky, comprehensive summer session has increased school costs by about 17 percent. A similar program in Rochester, Minnesota, uses a fee-tuition plan to lower the costs to about an 11 percent increase. The Polk County, Florida, 35-day session that can accommodate 50 percent of the student population costs an additional 6 percent over the regular school year. A  voluntary summer term program for 50 percent of the Oxford district student population is estimated to cost about 6.3 percent of the regular school budget. If nonpromoted students are required to attend the summer session and the cost of these students repeating a year is deducted from the cost of the summer session, the net cost of the summer session drops to 3.8 percent of the regular budget.

Against this understanding, the discussion is presented in three stages: the creation of an environment within which the school can innovate, the need for a strategy for educational development, and the direct intervention of public authorities in the process of educational innovation. A final section makes the point that no coherent framework for the analysis of social change and, therefore, of educational innovation can exist without an underlying philosophy of the social processes involved.

The uniqueness of the Oregon approach lies in the mechanism for bringing about change in the schools--a radically revised set of requirements for high school graduation. The focus of the revised graduation requirements is on identification and student achievement of minimum survival competencies in three broad areas: personal development, social responsibility, and career development. The initial focus on specifying, developing, and evaluating pupil competencies provides an opportunity to consider the support and resource needs of the schools as they design and implement mastery learning strategies. The  competency-based learning strategies will focus on the specification of competencies, the design and implementation of continuous feedback evaluation systems as students move through the learning experiences, and the summative certification of achievement of the competencies. Research and development related to these issues can improve the knowledge base and provide direction to other states and local education agencies as they seek to bring about reform through the competencies approach.

First year data was based on a sample of 108 children in first through fourth grades, while second year data reported a sample of 97 children in first through fourth grades. A sample of 48 children (second through fifth grades) who had received services the previous year were followed up and retested with measures of achievement and classroom behavior. Remediation was carried on according to either a deficit model which emphasized the remediation of specific weaknesses through one-to-one instruction by resource teacher, or an eclectic model which stressed teacher consultation and attempted to  capitalize on strengths as well as remediate weaknesses. Data indicated that the average child who participated in the program was below grade level when referred and was functioning at grade level when intervention was terminated. Classroom teachers who referred students to the program rated their children as significantly improved in both academic skills and personal/social behavior. Interviews with referring classroom teachers offered considerable evidence of teacher acceptance and support for the program. However, followup data suggested that children who received services the previous year failed to progress academically at the same rate over the first half of the next year without additional services.

Responses covered such topics as the following: countries which have explicit guardianship provisions for the MH, types of guardianship systems, guardianship systems which have a special judge, the function of the national Societies in guardianship, guardianship as a profession, incapacitation procedures, drawbacks of existing systems and prospects for change, and foundations, organizations and specific social groups working on a practical or theoretical level on the guardianship question. Appendixes  contained a list of persons responding to the questionnaire, a copy of the questionnaire, a table summarizing data for the U.S., information on the dates of general and special guardianship legislations, a bibliography and a listing of legislative sources on guardianship.

The fundamental assumptions of Piagetian theory are briefly summarized and the educational philosophy of Piaget is explained. Five representative early childhood education programs are described. Current criticisms of Piagetian theory and associated educational recommendations are reviewed and it is concluded that adopting a genuine Piagetian perspective conveys mixed blessings upon the aspirant educational innovator. The following principles are thought to be major, valid principles that may be derived from the Piagetian system: an awareness of intellectual product/process distinctions, a recognition of the crucial role of play activities, social interaction and associated peer  group processes, and the essential stipulation of self-initiated active involvement as the primary determinant of intellectual development. The third principle is thought to provide the fundamental continuity between Piaget's views and the numerous open classroom and self-discovery learning approaches to educational innovation.

Criticial issues are traced to three conditions: the need for educational programs and services for the handicapped who are presently unserved or inappropriately served; legislative and constitutional guarantees of equal educational opportunities; and an economy which necessitates the maximizing of educational resources. The above conditions are considered in relation to the level of state funding of programs and services, federal and state reimbursement formulas, the costs of special education for the handicapped, and the federal government's role in financing programs and services. It is suggested that issues related to the education of the handicapped be resolved on the basis of  such factors as the following: the elimination of practices whereby states only partially fund the educational costs for handicapped children, concomitant with a careful auditing of costs of educating such children in private institutions; and the realization by states that the federal government's reimbursement to the state for educating the handicapped child will be increasing, but will not be large enough to remove the need to make critical choices and set educational priorities before educational resources are allocated.

Among the seven clusters of specified teacher needs (including interpersonal communication and administration, assessment and discipline) identified on the Teacher Needs Assessment Survey, developing pupil self and individualizing instruction were designated as the most needed training areas. Questionnaire responses described a wide variety of inservice characteristics including frequency, meeting place, content, and teacher incentives. Analysis of data indicated that inservice topics were usually selected by persons other than the participants, followup and evaluation  were inadequate, and there was a need for clearer inservice goals and objectives. Implications for materials development included the need for separate production of inservice and preservice materials, for material design which would allow for individual teachers' needs, and for restricting materials to skill development rather than explication or motivation only.

It is explained that major project activities involved searching the literature, interviewing experts in early childhood education, and visiting local preschool programs. Discussed in the first half of the document are historical trends in the education of handicapped children, issues in early intervention and in early childhood mainstreaming, and problems in the research methodology. Summarized are considerations in developing an integrated early childhood program, and issues involved in a child's transition from such a program to an elementary school.  Among conclusions reported are that the value of an intervention program depends on the degree to which that program focuses on the child's special needs, and that greater public financial support is needed. Recommendations are also made regarding census taking by the states, future policies of the Bureau of Education for the Handicapped, and research needs. The second half of the document consists of the bibliography (Many entries are abstracted), with author and subject indexes. (LS)",

In the next section, personal experiences are recounted by a deaf parent with hearing children, hearing parents of deaf children, and four deafened or hard of hearing adults. Described are various resources to help the parent and child (such as the school for the deaf and the community college) and to help the deafened adult (such as a university hospital and the Lions International). Federal programs serving the deaf are reviewed and the role of  the volunteer is discussed. Future program development plans (which resulted from the conference) are reported by representative teams from seven states: Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Conference exhibitors are listed and conference evaluation forms are provided.

General objectives of the project are said to include development of an experimental special education model which could be adopted by a school system and of a model curriculum involving individual and small group instruction. Noted are concepts on which the Instructional Program Model is based such as regular class placement (in non-graded classes), small group and individualized instruction, and instructional strategies derived following comprehensive diagnosis. Outlined in detail are the following curriculum units: math (Cuisenaire Rods),  social studies ('Our Working World'), sciences, reading, language, and perceptual-motor skills. Examination of the project model includes job descriptions of the staff. Summarized are services and evaluation given by the medical, speech and hearing and psychological consultants, and by the social worker, and principals. Test data are analyzed to reveal the children's progress in reading, perceptual motor development, and intellectual and psycholinguistic abilities. A major finding reported was that 101 of 103 children involved in the program obtained achievement gains that would allow them to read independently as well as under instruction. (LS)",

Among major conclusions of the study were that existing accounting practices in Head Start agencies fall far short of permitting complete and accurate documentation of the true costs of serving handicapped children; that estimates suggest that the cost  of serving those handicapped children now enrolled (primarily the mildly handicapped) is only slightly more than that for serving any other typical Head Start child; but that the cost of serving severely handicapped children would be significantly greater than for the typical child. Recommendations included the need for a cost accounting procedure which provides for the recording of documented direct costs and an established pro-ration of indirect costs, utilizing programmatic budget procedures; and for the allocation of extra funds for the handicapped to be based on services rendered rather than on numbers of identified children enrolled.

Formulated by a group of independent consultants to a project which studied the handicapped effort in Head Start, the statement is said to have evolved partly from assessment of research data and partly from the deliberations and analyses of the consultants during the project year. Among the ten major conclusions cited are that handicapped children who are admitted are included in regular Head Start programs; that the moderately and severely handicapped appear to be frequently excluded from such program admission; and that Head Start staffs have positive  attitudes toward the handicapped and their rights to developmental opportunities. Improvements recommended include the need for Head Start policies to make clear the intent to include children with severe handicaps, and the need for re-evaluation of the 10 percent requirement.

The experiment was designed to determine whether visual mnemonics are more effective than unelaborated rehearsal technique for learning FL vocabulary, and whether a given visual mnemonic is more effective than one invented by the student. Seventy-five Spanish-language students with no prior training in German were randomly assigned to one of five groups, whose task was to learn the meaning of 24 German words as they were pronounced by native speakers. As each German word was pronounced on tape, the English meaning was flashed on the screen plus a mnemonic phrase. Group MG was told to use the  mnemonic phrase in learning the word meanings; Group A was told to use a specific algorithm; Group A-8 was told to make up original algorithms; Group R was instructed to repeat the word and its meaning silently as many times as possible; Group C, the control group, was told to use any method. All groups were allotted 12 seconds per word except Group A-8, which had 20. A learning text was administered immediately after the instruction session, followed by a questionnaire and then by a retention test. A major conclusion is that strategies involving verbal or visual mnemonics were considerably more effective than a repetition technique, and that a self-generated visual mnemonic is more effective than a given one.

A preliminary oral proficiency test in English and Spanish was administered to 45 bilingual students, of whom 41 took both versions. On the basis of difficulty and significant tendencies, 32 items were selected as the revised version of the vocabulary test and 16 items as the revised version of the grammar test. Five independent variables (grade, sex, years of schooling in the United States, place of birth, and reported language use with family) were used in a univariate analysis of test scores in order to determine whether they contributed significantly to the variance in those scores. In most cases the significant contribution of the  independent variables were in the expected direction (e.g., performance in English increased with grade). Modification of the grammar test is required in order to focus students' responses on the intended grammatical structures. Administration of both parts of the proficiency test on grammar to larger and different samples of pupils, and the correlation of test results with other independent variables, are needed to establish the validity of the test.

Some of the reasons for the lack of success of the audiolingual method are given as: the large size of the classes; the young age and poor motivation of the students; the small number of weekly hours devoted to FL instruction; and the poor preparation of the professors. An eclectic method is proposed which incorporates: (1) the use of the FL as much as possible; (2) the active use of the mind, from the Direct Method; and (3) the use of drills, exercises, composition practice, etc., from the grammatical method. In addition, to insure the method's success, class sizes must be reduced; the aural-oral period must last several months; weekly instruction hours must  be increased; and traditional methods such as dictation and translation must be used to insure the development of spelling and comprehension skills. It is hoped that this active and intensive method will give students a firm foundation with emphasis on the spoken language. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"Research was conducted to study systematically the comprehension and production of the pronouns &quot;he, she, him, her&quot; in the language of normal and linguistically deviant children. The purposes of the study were to: observe the manner in which normal children comprehend and produce these four pronouns, in terms of both their use and their distinctive features of sex and case; compare these results with similar phenomena in linguistically deviant children; and determine the general systematic stages of pronoun development. Thirty linguistically normal and thirty linguistically deviant children were tested. Each subject was asked to perform one comprehension and one production test involving the use of four dolls: father, mother, son, and daughter. Responses were tape-recorded and  transcribed. Three main classes of errors emerged: errors of gender, of reference, and of both gender and reference. Errors of gender and reference were most prevalent in the normal group; errors of gender reversal were most common in the deviant group. Other findings included: (1) females in both groups tended to make fewer errors than males; (2) generally, high performance on comprehension tasks was accompanied by high performance on production tasks; (3) generally, comprehension task scores were equal to or greater than those received on production tasks; and (4) the deviant group performance fell well below the normal group performance.

        "description":"This report is a detailed empirical examination of Suppes' ideas about the syntax and semantics of natural language, and an attempt at supporting the proposal that model-theoretic semantics of the type first proposed by Tarski is a useful tool for understanding the semantics of natural language. Child speech was selected as the best place to find data on natural language because it presents a view of the real problems represented by natural language, and because it allows the study of the process of language development. The main body of data consists of a series of recordings between a 32-month-old girl, Erica, and several adults. The ERIC corpus is found to be syntactically simpler and semantically more straightforward than adult speech. It is divided into utterances; its  vocabulary is compared to ADULT vocabulary; a word frequency count is made; and its words are classified gramatically. A discussion follows of the standard concepts and results of the theory of generative grammars. A grammar for ERICA is devised, with special attention to lexical ambiguity. Mathematical syntax and semantics are discussed, followed by a description of ERICA semantics, with special reference to grammatical and semantic ambiguity. Conclusions include: (1) a reasonable probabilistic grammar for ERICA can be constructed; (2) the grammar GE1 is the best model for lexical disambiguation; (3) the grammar functions reasonably well semantically; (4) the notion of probability can play a key role in the construction of a semantics; and (5) simple set-theoretical functions are often  successful in describing the ERICA semantics.

Information about premises, equipment, and activities was collected by means of questionnaires, interviews, and visits to sample schools. The survey covers voluntary Welsh-medium nursery schools, but local authority-maintained classes were included for comparative purposes. Growth of the movement is discussed, as well as problems of space and budget. The background of the teachers and students is also discussed. The primary motivation is seen to be the desire to preserve the Welsh language and culture, but interest and support was also found in non-Welsh homes. Based on an assessment of students' progress, it is concluded that the voluntary Welsh-medium nursery schools promote  bilingualism without detriment to academic progress; that this movement is still primarily a middle-class movement; and that Welsh-medium nursery education should be incorporated into the state-supported system.

Initial strategies included the use of simple patterns and light vocabulary load, plus the use of puppets, illustrations, and music; the use of these and other teaching aids is described. Satisfactory progress was made in oral and then written proficiency, to the extent that science is now being taught in Welsh, and it is believed that other subjects could be taught in Welsh as well.

        "description":"This pamphlet offers some suggestions on the use of Welsh as a second language in Welsh schools. In the present-day situation the goal of a bilingual Wales is far from realized; it appears that equal fluency in both languages is seldom achieved. A case is made for: (1) thorough grounding in a child's home language before the introduction of a second; and (2) the introduction of the second language at an early age. It is also noted that the precarious position of Welsh vs. English calls for special handling of English as a second language in Welsh-speaking Wales. Attention is drawn to the need for the introduction of Welsh in nursery schools. Suggestions are made for the use of nursery rhymes, songs, etc, and for considerate and sympathetic teaching to insure a positive attitude  in the child. It appears that the whole school system needs to be adjusted to achieve the bilingual goal. Finally, consideration is given to the teaching of Welsh as a second language to older children. The Bilingual Translation Method is advocated for this purpose, and the structural approach is also discussed. Finally, true bilingualism is seen as possible only through an adequate number of contact hours with each language. (AM)",

Ideas, tasks, grading, and planning were shared; and teachers were motivated by peer cooperation to strive for greater excellence in teaching. Students were more highly motivated and preferred team teaching over the traditional approach.

This will assure the development and the maintenance of a relatively small group of specialists prepared to face emergencies and constituting a reserve of national expertise. An overview is provided of linguistic areas for the development of priority language materials; these areas are divided into Uralic, Altaic, and Tibetan.

In a pleasant classroom, 12 students sit in specail chairs in front of a teacher individually trained in the foreign language and in &quot;suggestion.&quot; Classes meet six days a week for four hours. Each of the three courses in a given foreign language lasts a month. During the initial course, students memorize some 2,000 word-groups and corresponding grammar. A class session consists of three parts: (1) conversational review of previous lessons; (2) presentation of new material in the form of &quot;realistic&quot; dialogues; (3) the seance or relaxation session during which the new  material is reinforced by the following techniques: coordination of sound and image; various intonations in the repetition of a given phrase; a background of 18th century baroque music; the acting out of the text. The seance features a coordination of breathing rhythm, speaking rhythm, and music rhythm and produces both relaxation and concentration. It is claimed that suggestopedia speeds up the assimilation of the basic elements of a foreign language and eliminates the stress of an intensive course. (Author/AM)",

Surface structure refers not to a single but to at least four distinct notions that do not necessarily define a homogeneous level of representation: output of the syntactic component, input to the phonological component, phonetic structure, and the level at which surface structure constraints are stated. Based on a survey of the literature, the conclusions include the necessity of direct links between deeper syntax and phonology, the influence of phonology on various syntactic operations, the need for phonetic information in certain semantic interpretation rules, and the lack of  homogeneity among surface structure constraints. Finally, there is a recurrent influence of prosodic and morphological phenomena which motivate the revisions needed in the general organization of a grammar because they limit the types of interaction between the various grammatical domains.

Furthermore, bilingual education has not been defined as a collective effort for the communication of sound teaching strategies and techniques for the bilingual and potentially-bilingual student; and it has not come to grips with the assessment procedures which are geared to the actual teaching/learning situation. This paper argues that we must not allow the designation of bilingual education as solely a temporary measure, to be utilized until the student is capable of receiving  instruction in English; making no effort to maintain and enhance his command of the native language. To succeed, indeed, to survive, it must also be recognized as beneficial to the English-speaking majority as well as to the other language groups which form such a significant part of our society. Obviously a valid system of bilingual education demands pervasive change throughout the educational system, in the attitude of society, in government policy, and in the economic priorities of the state.

Objectives are based on learners' needs and expressed in terms of operational learning objectives, with reference to the roles a language-user has to play, the settings in which he will play these roles, and the topics he will deal with. The threshold level (T-level) is defined for a specific population. Part 1 describes the establishment of a unit-credit system and the definition of language-learning objectives. In part 2, the T-level is defined in detail with reference to the following dimensions: specific situations, language activities, language functions, behavioral specifications, general and specific  notions. Finally, the degree of skill involved in T-level competence is characterized as a guideline for test construction. Criterion levels for testing are also briefly discussed. While this work deals with English, the same analytical procedure could be used for other languages. Appendices contain: (1) an alphabetical list of lexical items and their category or meaning within the T-level objectives; (2) an alphabetical grammatical inventory of English that demonstrates the range of structures and possible utterances that would have to be taught for T-level objectives; and (3) a grammatical summary of English structures.

The entries in part 2 are concerned with the Puerto Rican child in the American educational system. This section deals with the child's socioeconomic and sociocultural characteristics, intelligence and cognitive development; measurement of the child's self-concept, socialization, language competence and scholastic achievement; special  educational programs for Puerto Ricans and other non-English speakers; educational materials for teachers; and teacher training and attitudes. The entries in part 3 deal with the Puerto Rican experience on the mainland. The topics covered here include demographic studies and migration patterns, the psychological adjustment of migrants, sociological and anthropological studies of communities, and the group's experience as it is portrayed in Anglo and Puerto Rican literature. Part 4 is a bibliography of unpublished materials. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This teaching manual is the seventh in a series designed for use in bilingual/bicultural programs. This manual discusses ideas for applying the concept of cultural democracy to the school curriculum by incorporating the study of the Mexican-American. Six alternative exploratory concepts are suggested as ways of escaping the traditional frames of reference for the Chicano experience and helping to eradicate common misconceptions. The concepts are: (1) a recognition of the influences on the development of the &quot;Greater America&quot; of the American cultures that existed prior to the arrival of the Europeans; (2) the comparative analysis of ethnic experiences; (3) the diversity among Chicanos; (4) the view of society as a problem for Chicanos, rather than Chicanos as a problem for  society; (5) an awareness of the history of Mexican-Americans; and (6) a recognition of the Chicano people as a whole, not through isolated individual success stories. Teaching strategies and techniques, the use of community resources, and supplementary materials related to these concepts are also suggested. These concepts and strategies can also be adapted to the study of other ethnic groups. A manual of self-assessment units accompanies this series. (Author/AM)",

This objective is considered vitally important in creating culturally democratic educational environments. The manual begins with a number of exercises which indicate how easily the two teaching strategies can be mastered. Instructions for using field sensitive and field independent teaching strategies are explained, and a rating form to use in determining success in using either of the two strategies is included. Finally a discussion of curriculum indicates how the &quot;style&quot; of  instructional materials can be identified and, when necessary, altered for use in field sensitive or field independent teaching. Observation check lists for both types of strategies are appended. A manual of self-assessment units accompanies this series. (Author/AM)",

This manual outlines some features of culturally democratic educational environments and illustrates ways in which the schools can take positive steps to assure that every child can preserve pride and loyalty toward the culture represented by his family and community. Examples are given of the conflicts that children can experience when schools undermine cultural loyalties, and their consequences, e.g., tensions between parents and children; alienation of children from the school, teachers, and peer groups; and antagonism between school and community. In spite of the diversity in values, there are recurrent themes in what is taken seriously and emphasized in most Mexican American  communities. These fall into the categories of identification with family, community, and ethnic group; personalization of interpersonal relationships; status and role definition in family and community; and Mexican Catholic ideology. The manual examines these value areas in detail, and offers a 10-point set of guidelines suggesting ways to create educational environments in which Mexican-American values are afforded dignity and respect.

The subject discussed here is the influence of socialization practices on children's cognitive styles and in particular, children's learning styles, and the implications this has for bilingual/bicultural education. The characteristics of field sensitive and field independent cognitive styles are described, followed by a discussion of the relationship between cognitive style and culture and socialization styles. An illustration of this relationship is drawn from the situation of Mexican-American children, who typically score in a field sensitive direction on tests of cognitive style. Such scores are thought to result from the traditional Mexican-American emphasis on family  loyalty and a close interpersonal relationship between mother and children, values that encourage field sensitivity. An appreciation of the diversity of cognitive and socialization styles must precede the planning of culturally democratic educational environments.

The script is given, along with an English translation. The story concerns several French students at an outdoor cafe wondering about one of their friends. The conversation includes 10 typical French gestures, including those showing amazement, disbelief, power, greetings, and drinking. All 10 gestures are described in this paper, as well as incidental aspects of French culture which appear in the film. The pedagogical applications of the film follow its description. Several ideas for projects similar to this one are proposed. These include presentations using several different media to be made both abroad and at home. Emphasis  is placed on involving students in the work. The paper concludes with a statement of the importance of studying nonverbal communication. (Author/AM)",

        "author":["Keller, Howard H."],
        "description":"Language teaching requires textbook material that contains the most frequent concepts of a language. The computer brings its tremendous information processing ability to the task of establishing word frequency rankings, but the computer is limited to counting word-forms and not semantic concepts. The most recent word frequency dictionaries, in fact, exclude parsing and lemmatization from their data base (Kucera and Francis, 1967: John B. Carroll, 1971). This paper describes the problems involved in adjusting a list of the 7,000 most frequent English words (word-forms) for polysemantic variants (e.g., cardinal &quot;bird&quot; vs. &quot;church dignitary&quot;) and for homonyms (e.g., pawn &quot;chess piece&quot; vs. &quot;pledge for a loan&quot;). Polysemy and homonymy present a significant problem in that one word-form  often expresses two or more differing concepts. The converse of this problem is synonymy--two or more word-forms expressing one concept (e.g., &quot;freedom&quot;, &quot;liberty&quot;). The resolution of the difference between word-form and concept representation is important for accurate computerized frequency rankings and for concept inclusion in various &quot;thousand&quot; frequency groups. These problems will also be studied in connection with the establishment of a universal concept list for student review of foreign language vocabulary. (Author)",

        "description":"For the past 15 years there has been a serious interest in the processing of natural language (English) by researchers in Artificial Intelligence (A.I.). This processing has included machine translation, question-answering systems, man-machine dialogue, and speech understanding. This interest has engendered an awareness of and a concern with the ongoing activity in contemporary linguistics. Therefore, it may be of interest to linguistis to discover what has seemed important for A.I. and how it has been adapted and used. Thus a brief history of the relation (almost always one-way) between A.I. and linguistics is presented. Some of the works in A.I. surveyed range from those of the early sixties, such as Lindsay's SAD SAM, Green et al BASEBALL, and Bobrow's STUDENT, to more recent  efforts, including Wood's transition network grammars, Winograd's SHRDLU, and Schank's conceptual dependency models. In one way or another, these computer programs and others depend on the work of Chomsky, both \"Syntactic Structures\" and \"Aspects,\" Halliday's systemic grammar, and some of the ideas of generative semantics as developed by G. Lakoff, McCawley, and Fillmore. (Author/KM)",

This study is put in the context of relations with the English, the historical background of the Welsh, and the larger context of autonomist movements in Europe and North America, South America, Asia, and Africa. The questions explored here include: (1) what is the relationship between ethnicity, nationalism, and language; (2) under what circumstances do they fuse into one another; (3) to what extent do they have an underlying unity,  yet can be discussed apart; and (4) what accounts for the persistence of ethnicity well into the twentieth century? The report is divided into the following sections: a brief history of European, Celtic, and Welsh nationalism; issues and development in Welsh nationalism; land, language, and community; language versus institutions; the school as an agency of regeneration; and the teaching of history in the schools. Implications of this study in relation to ethnicity, nationalism, and bilingualism are also discussed. (Author/AM)",

These activities should increase the likelihood that the children will feel comfortable, and will respond vocally and enthusiastically during subsequent systematic instruction in standard American English. The teacher can conduct the pre-lessons effectively with almost no preparation. Pre-lessons contain both instructions and lessons; the rationale for each day's lesson is given in narrative form, followed by a numbered outline of the steps in the lesson. There is a development from teacher-led to pupil-led activities, and from almost no dependence on verbal instruction to preliminary testing for such dependence. A  critical difference between the pre-lessons and directed instruction in language is that the children are not expected to produce or understand specific utterances during most of the pre-lessons. They are especially recommended for the first few days of school prior to beginning other oral language instructional programs. These activities have been pilot-tested with six groups of preschool children. Appendices contain instructions for making mats out of newspapers and the text of an introductory speech in English, Spanish, and Navajo. (Author/AM)",

A test instrument consisting of nonsense syllable trigrams was constructed based on linguistic descriptions of English noun pluralization. Accompanied by visual stimuli, this instrument was administered to 120 six-year-old children in the El Paso area. Results of the data analysis indicate that there is no significant effect of initial /s/ on successful noun pluralization, although /s/ is more frequently associated with misarticulations in both singular and plural responses. Results are discussed in terms of linguistic rules for pluralization, differences between  pluralization strategies of native English and native Spanish speakers, and sources of /s/ misarticulations.

As a corollary, it is argued that centering diphthongs which become tonal monophthongs arise as a result of the disturbance of the timing of disyllabic sequences with one medial consonant. The argument is based on (1) phonetic studies, and (2) historical and comparative examination of Germanic dialects. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"Interview tapes of adult Cubans from the Latin American Capital Cities Dialect Project were transcribed, focusing on the variability in the deletion of word-final consonants, especially /s/. The operation of the deletion rule for /s/ in Cuban Spanish is shown to be principally dependent on grammatical categories and surface syntactic function. In particular, it is shown that Labov's hypothesis that &quot;whenever a final consonant is variably deleted the rule will operate more often... if it is an integral part of the word and not a separate morphome...&quot; is too general. The deletion in Cuban Spanish is constrained by a functionalist condition, in this case, the pressure to preserve the singular/plural contrast in noun phrases. The /s/ most often deleted is the one preceded by a  determiner which preserves a number marker. Other grammatical categories are unaffected. (Author)",

In the sample program described here, an interdisciplinary committee first stated an integrated view of the bilingual teacher in the role description. They then defined the competencies which lead to the development of the abilities described in the role. The complete list of competencies is included and contains the following categories: working with children, working with parents, cultural interactions, diagnosis and prescription, communication skills in the native language, communication in the target language, subject areas, and  personal and professional development. When the list of competencies was complete, they were clustered according to general areas and assigned to classes on that basis. Individual instructors then agreed to develop and assess competence within their areas of specialization. A sample class schedule of a methods course in which specific bilingual competencies were to be developed and assessed through sequenced modules is included. (Author)",

The first stage of the research dealt with the career related aspirations, expectations, and apprehensions of 1,858 American college seniors of the class of 1972. This document, which is the second stage of the study, is based on data obtained from this group one year after college graduation. The major purpose of the follow-up study is to identify the fit between career-related expectations and career-related outcomes one year after college graduation. The document begins with a discussion and review of the first study. Then chapters describe: (1) the procedures utilized in the development of the follow-up questionnaire, the process utilized in efforts to reach the respondents, the  results of these efforts, and data dealing with the representativeness of the follow-up sample; (2) the marital, geographic, and career-related attitudes of graduates; (3) respondents who entered the full-time employment market after graduation, the process by which college graduates seek employment, and general attitudes toward current and future work settings; (4) experiences and attitudes of those who have pursued graduate and professional school involvements, noting how variables such as sex and field of study relate to variation in graduate school experiences and attitudes; and (5) differences and similarities between three groups using sex, socioeconomic status, and field of study as variables in explaining differences in post-college activities.

Notwithstanding the accomplishments of private institutions, demographic studies of postsecondary education indicate declines in private enrollments, a trend that is destined to become increasingly pronounced in the immediate future. This document surveys options available to small colleges threatened by declining enrollments, inflated costs, and decreased tuition related income. Five representative colleges highlighted here typify the strategies in use to combat declining enrollments and increasing costs. Most of these institutions reported the employment of multiple approaches. A principal method  used is an increased response to new markets: evening students, adults, disadvantaged, mature women, veterans, commuter students, business trainees, military personnel, and job training for nurses, technicians, and managers. Improving overall management by reevaluating budgets and programs or by upgrading the professional level of management within the institution are frequently used strategies. Private colleges should reexamine their institutional goals and charter to determine the strategies most compatible with their educational mission. (Author/KE)",

Attempts have been made to develop a standard unit cost, but it is hard to see unit cost accounting by itself as a valuable tool for public accountability or policy making. For these purposes a cost-effectiveness ratio is needed. Efforts to analyze costs have proceeded much further and gained considerably more sophistication than efforts to measure effectiveness. As a result, it is understandable that policy makers frequently find themselves relying on cost figures alone as a basis for decisions. Why is it that efforts to measure effectiveness fail? What might be done to move in that direction and what are the problems? In an attempt to answer these  questions the study considers: (1) criteria by default: manpower models; (2) criteria: access and retention; (3) criteria: vocational and career choices; (4) education's lifelong benefits; (5) measurement as an educational tool.

It examines the choice process of acquiring knowledge. The choice of one program (physics) over others (history, math) is clearly important in that physics knowledge and history knowledge cannot be considered as perfect substitutes in either a utility or production sense. Unlike conventional studies in the economics of education, the authors examine the ground between empirical demand studies for education and the studies that assume knowledge embodiment (human capital). Thus, student and faculty choice is examined that is internal to a university. Some questions considered are: What are the impacts of different student aptitudes on  curricular choice and the decision to switch majors? What effects do student evaluations and varied grading schemes have on the learning process? Why do educational innovations appear to be ineffective? What are the choice implications of academic freedom? What are the causes and effects of grade inflation? Can faculty performance be evaluated? A variety of evidence is used to support models of student and faculty choice. However, the main thrust of this document is in developing a theory of learning based on economics and public choice.

        "description":"This document discusses several of the most significant analytic meanings to be found in enrollment data, with the expectation that some of the already developed analytic tools, when properly tuned, can be applied to enrollment and similar data. The Induced Course Load Matrix (ICLM) is a theoretical concept developed from situations in business and industry where talk is of inputs and outputs. The input in this document is students, faculty and staff, facilities, and finances. However, students, faculty, and staff are also decision makers and cannot be manipulated in the same way as more tangible variables used in business. After consideration of enrollment data and the Induced Load Matrix it appears evident that the ICLM is best suited to macro-level analysis and decision  making. The document then attempts to develop a micro-level tool that can be employed in the study of retention and attrition rates in enrollment and is useful for data requiring longitudinal study, such as enrollment statistics that take into account peer group influences. In conclusion, answers such as those sought above cannot be found in the familiar aggregate numbers game. It is more likely that one or more management science tools will play a part in the answers sought. (Author/KE)",

Given the large numbers of institutions and students involved in this study, and given institutional differences in type, size, program offerings, and location, the document does not report on individual institutions. Statistical summaries cover (a) total enrollment-combined full-time, part-time undergraduate and graduate, and (b) full-time undergraduate enrollment only. Both summaries are subgrouped by type of  institution to better analyze the public and private sector and two- and four-year institutions. This document has basically been limited to an analysis of responses received from students enrolled in full-time undergraduate studies. Chapters cover: the postsecondary student in Pennsylvania; parental income; dependence and independence; the costs of a postsecondary education in Pennsylvania; the determination of financial need; the financial aid reported by the student respondents; patterns of meeting student expenses in Pennsylvania institutions.

The history of American education is based on the principle that colleges and universities should be readily accessible to successive waves of new students on easy and inviting terms. Despite all this educational effort, our society today seems to be floundering. Today the nation is engaged in a great debate about the future of higher education, especially about the wisdom of expanding it still further to serve new classes of students. The question is whether  the historic development of higher education should be resumed. In trying to reach conclusions about the future national policy for higher education, the document first considers the questions: Just what is higher education now contributing to American society and are the results worth what they cost? The document also discusses economic outcomes, outcomes as changes in society derived from changes in individuals, outcomes as changes in society derived directly from higher education, and higher education and the enrichment of lives.

This document focuses on the item in the questionnaire termed &quot;current political preference.&quot; The document examines the political preferences of U.S.C. entering freshmen over a six-year period between 1969 and 1974 and provides a comparison with national norms. In addition, analyses on the bases of sex and  state residency are given. The document concludes by summarizing the trends observed over the six-year period. Findings are that in 1969, U.S.C entering freshmen were less &quot;left&quot; and more &quot;middle-of-the-road&quot; and &quot;right&quot; in their political preferences than were their national counterparts. However, the extent of differences has diminished between 1969 and 1974, with U.S.C. and the national norms becoming almost identical in 1974. (Author/KE)",

The purpose of this document is to shed light on the kinds of people who left rather than to try to answer the question of why students withdraw from Hofstra. Questionnaires were mailed in November 1972 to all students who voluntarily withdrew in September of that year. Thirty percent (206) of the questionnaires were returned. The sample differed from all withdrawers in that there was a larger proportion of females, natives, freshmen, and higher GPA's among them than among all withdrawers. Their responses were analyzed to  gain some insight into the reasons given by students in good academic standing who leave Hofstra. The reasons given by withdrawers for leaving Hofstra were categorized into five major groups of reasons. Financial, personal, and dissatisfaction with nonacademic aspects of Hofstra were each cited by more than 35 percent of the respondents. Dormitory reasons were cited by more than 50 percent of the respondents who lived in the dorms. Dissatisfaction with academic aspects of the college was cited by 28 percent of the respondents. Respondent withdrawers who had GPA's of 3.00 and higher indicated that conditions of residency and dissatisfaction with nonacademic aspects of Hofstra were of the greatest importance in their decision to leave.

Some observations are that: faculty collective bargaining is primarily a phenomenon of the public sector of higher education; growth of faculty collective bargaining, to date, has closely paralleled the enactment of state collective bargaining laws; enactment of new enabling laws in states where such action appears imminent is likely to produce a new acceleration of faculty collective bargaining activity in the  public sector; state bargaining laws rarely recognize college and university faculty as special categories of public employees; the structure of collective bargaining varies considerably from state to state; failure to exclude traditional governance mechanisms from the scope of bargaining has raised the possibility that faculty senates and other traditional governance mechanisms are illegal; collective bargaining provides a new framework for a redistribution of authority and responsibility in academic governance. In conclusion the document discusses the centralization and homogenization of faculty personnel policies on the part of state governments and legislatures and the unionization of middle management.

They represent a fresh source of energy for reform that must be recognized by faculty unions and university administrators who seek higher levels of cooperation and new directions for service. This document reviews student involvement in collective bargaining. Some effects of collective bargaining on students are: (1) fear of the loss of student rights; (2) fear that increases in salaries and fringe benefits negotiated by the faculty unions will at least partly come out of students' pockets in the form of higher tuition and fees; (3) fear of strikes that would interrupt their education. Student impact on collective bargaining is felt through: (1) lobbying for legislation to protect student interests; (2)  undertaking legal (court) action; (3) asking to have a student observer (or team) sit in on negotiations; (4) including students on the bargaining team of one or both sides; and (5) trying to be included in negotiations as an independent third party. The author predicts that student involvement in collective bargaining negotiations will increase in the future, especially if present action of this type proves successful.

Students realized the need for a national student advocacy movement that would work directly on legislative concerns and would truly be a continuing presence in the nation's capital. At the same time, a network of fledgling student organizations was beginning to spring up on state capitals and on campuses around the country. Then in 1971 a group of students from California who felt challenged by the need at the national level formed a coordinating committee for a national student lobbying organization. This document discusses the recent activities of those lobbying groups. Topics covered are: the new tactics of the groups that employ small full-time staffs of  professional student representatives instead of the large-scale student demonstrations of the 1960's; the new emphasis on financial issues; the work of the National Student Lobby (NSL), a full-time student lobbying group; the state lobbies in California, Illinois, Colorado, Montana, and New York; and trends for the future.

The Commission's study groups conducted their inquiry through literature reviews and through questionnaires distributed at Stanford and at other academic and research libraries in the United States. The prime recommendation of the study was that a Librarian's Assembly be founded consisting of all librarians at the university. The assembly would serve to improve communication between librarians, increase staff involvement in policy formation, and formulate recommendations to  the chief library administrative officers on library operations and personnel policies. The study also examined the role and responsibilities of Stanford librarians in terms of collection development, bibliographic control, public service, library instruction, and management.

The roots of society's concern for the young are traced to Hammurabi and television's duality in denying that it influences children to violence, while selling its persuasiveness as an advertising medium, is decried. The recent statement of the Federal Communications Commission on the duties of broadcasters to provide children's programs that educate and inform as well as entertain is discussed, along with policies of the Federal Trade Commission on advertising in children's programing. A 9-point set of guidelines is proposed for broadcasters to help them upgrade children's programing.  (SK)",

The project required 32 hours of work per week for 9 weeks at $2.00 per hour, paid by the NYC Program. The NYC Program was also to provide the enrollees with counseling and instructional sessions related to their work experiences. It was found that heeding the NYC &quot;Success Model&quot; criteria, analyzing jobs prior to the start of the Program, taking into account the gregariousness of the youth, providing continuous training, and encouraging positive attitudes on the part of supervisors are essential to a successful NYC Program. Four people  were terminated during the program; 6 did a commendable job and received good recommendations from their supervisors. Almost all of the library supervisors expressed concern with the structure and lack of cooperation on the part of the NYC supervisory staff. The Program was expensive in terms of training and supervision, but it was concluded that, overall, the Program was mutually beneficial, and would be participated in again. (KKC)",

To determine if these demands have caused changes, a survey was made of the personnel organization schemes at the libraries of five major universities--Texas A&amp;M, Harvard, Minnesota, Oklahoma, and the University of California at Los Angeles--noting how these schemes reflect the Association of College and Research Libraries' standards for faculty status. The question of faculty status for librarians was examined in terms of faculty organizations; librarians' role in governance; and appointment, promotion, and tenure practices. Other aspects of personnel policy; fringe benefits, termination and grievance procedures,  compensation, leaves, research funds, and academic freedom; were also examined. It was concluded that, at present, the drive for faculty status is the most favored scheme for the rationalization and improvement of academic library personnel systems; however, personnel practices and participative management schemes are still in a state of flux, and many new directions are possible.

After a look at the history and composition of the community in general, the planners considered the history and present situation of the library building, the print and non-print collections, hours and staff, research periodicals and copying facilities, services to students and to local institutions, technical services, circulation procedures, services and charges to non-residents, and functions of the library board. In addition, the planners made a special feasibility study of bookmobile service. Recommendations were made concerning expansion of buildings and collections, especially non-print collections; additional funding and  charges; enlarging the reference collections; increasing hours and staff; copying facilities; coordination of technical services with other libraries; circulation control and routines; and library board policies and documents. Tables are provided for (1) a comparison of Orillia's library services with those of other libraries, and (2) books, circulation, and expenditures 1965-70. (LS)",

Five significant sociological challenges to public library systems are examined: (1) the knowledge explosion, (2) technological expansion, (3) social modification, (4) minority needs, and (5) social mobility. Part II examines the history of the Ottawa Public Library and includes a review of individual branches with suggestions for improvement.

Because of the sizable number of foreign born residents, an emphasis on books and materials on English as a second language is proposed. Whitby's present bookstock and circulation compares  unfavorably with the minimum standards accepted by Canadian libraries.

The shift from unrestricted television viewing for preschoolers to the emphasis on verbal communication in school may be the cause. Visual languages within a symbolic system could be one method of communication of ideas between people. Visual literacy is centered in the right cerebral hemisphere of the average person; therefore children are accumulating language experiences in the right hemisphere until they enter school and are urged to use verbal communication, a left hemispheric activity. An experiment was conducted using boys with above average intelligence who had reading problems. It was learned that all three had an unusually high  capacity for three dimensional visualization, a characteristic of artists, architects, and other visually oriented people. Visual communication should be seen as a form of sequential language and not necessarily a form of aesthetic expression. (DS)",

American educators have been concentrating efforts on the left hemisphere of the brain in which the verbal language skills, including reading and writing, develop and ignoring the right hemisphere of the brain in which visual sequencing, visual literacy, and visual patterning develop. Quite by accident, television has begun to cultivate the right side of the brain. That this may be so was discovered when Dr. Robert Thorndyke and others began to revalidate the Stanford-Binet IQ test, and it was found that the IQ of children changes, rising sharply  at about age 2 when children begin paying attention to television and declining at age of 5 1/2 when children begin school and are pressed in the direction of verbal activities and forced away from the visual activities in which they have become skilled. Programs in several schools have shown that training in visual skills can produce a marked increase in verbal skills. (KKC)",

Instrumentation was designed and developed to measure the effects of (1) media exposure, (2) perceptions of media messages, (3) susceptibility of media influences, (4) behavior modification and media technologies, (5) functional categories of  affective responses to media messages. The course covers experience in varied forms of media, and student performance was evaluated by locally devised measurements.

The Lister Hill Center Experimental CAI Network was established in July, 1972, on the recommendation of the National Library of Medicine, to test the feasibility of sharing CAI materials through a national computer network. Three suppliers of CAI programs--Ohio State University, the Massachusetts General Hospital, and the University of Illinois Medical Center in Chicago--combined with one commercial time-sharing corporation to realize the network concept. CAI programs on the network are applicable to health science users at all levels and have been utilized by over 100 health science institutions. The network  was initially free to users. While the institution of charges caused an initial drop in the number of users, their numbers have risen again, and the network is now self-supporting. This network method may be too expensive to allow most libraries to make effective use of CAI, but costs could be cut through the use of minicomputers and intelligent terminals. (Author/SL)",

Two learning tasks which provide the most difficulty for students were selected and instructionally programed for the PLATO IV system. Drill and practice routines for the two tasks were prepared in three methods. Two games were designed which utilized PLATO IV display capabilities, along with a conventional problem presentation followed by answer feedback routine. A group of students was assigned to each of the counterbalanced order of the independent tasks. Within each group, students received one of the six possible combinations of the three methods. No significant differences in performance or  training time measures were found between the three training methods. Questionnaire data indicated that students who experienced both game mathematics practice and conventional practice definitely preferred game practice. It was observed that the effectiveness of using games as an instructional technique suffered more than that of the conventional method when PLATO IV hardware and software operations were unstable.

A wide range of published and unpublished primary and secondary statistics were used for a variety of other analyses. The analyses of literature growth showed that it is necessary to re-examine the widely held view that the bulk of literature growth has been and will continue to be exponential. Accelerating and exponential growth has  occurred in much of the serial literature, but in only a few parts of the monograph literature. Production and growth characteristics in different forms of literature and subjects were compared.

The literature survey discovered plentiful material on centralized library processing and on the theoretical basis of PPBS  and a shortage of information in the fields of processing nonbook materials and the application of management systems to technical services processing centers. Thirty-nine references are included. (PF)",

In 1974, to aid in statewide planning and in the development of each project, the state library commissioned this study of all its multicounty cooperative projects. Through mailed questionnaires and site visits, a review was made of each cooperative and its beginnings, organizational structure, needs assessment techniques, success in meeting established objectives, and long range plans. Emerging patterns and trends were identified and recommendations made for the state library, the Ohio Library Association, the ALSO, and the multicounty agencies. (Author/SL)",

To that end the NEDCC held meetings, seminars, and workshops to train library personnel in restoration, cleaning, and other material preservation techniques. NEDCC also (1) offered to survey libraries' environments and  conditions and make recommendations and (2) made available matching grants to libraries for restoration and preservations of materials.

Viewers of four different episodes of the Globetrotters were questioned about the program they had seen. Among the findings were: (1) overall, 87 percent of the children received one or more specific pro-social messages from the episode he or she viewed; (2) older children (10-11) were more likely to play back at least one pro-social message than were younger children (7-8), and middle class children were more likely to do so than lower class children; (3) reception of pro-social messages was not related to frequency of viewing the Globetrotters; (4) both  distortion of pro-social messages and spontaneous reporting of the relevance of such messages to the child's own life were rare; (5) the themes of &quot;honesty,&quot;&quot;kindness,&quot; and &quot;safety&quot; were more readily grasped than was &quot;loyalty;&quot; (6) certain &quot;recurring&quot; pro-social messages were communicated by several episodes, and &quot;golden rule&quot; messages were played back most frequently; (7) &quot;slippage&quot; was indicated by the fact that 35 percent of the children stated that the Globetrotters taught them to play basketball or to spell; and (8) children thought the Globetrotters both entertained and set a good moral example.

The study tested the MMUC against other methods of locating materials and against the alternative of using a large backup library--the National Library of Medicine--to fill requests instead of routing requests through the network. The results of the hypothesis testing, a theoretical model of library cooperation, and eight evaluation criteria were applied to eight options for locational control of monographs. It was recommended that the network utilize  existing or developing computerized data bases of monograph titles but that the current catalog be maintained at a minimum level until such time as these data bases provide the locational probability currently possible with the MMUC.

Lectures covered the characteristics of the MEDLINE network and several data bases, access via Tymshare and direct dial, types of terminals, log-in procedures, computer physiology, boolean logic, commands, question analysis and user interaction, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), use of MeSH tools, and principles of coordinate indexing.  Laboratory sessions paralleled the lectures, and students were given access to MEDLINE in connection with field work assignments. Evaluation by students and faculty led to the conclusion that MEDLINE training was well received and worthwhile to students, though the high cost of terminals, computer time, telephone, and other tools may make some kind of subsidy necessary for future courses.

The state's 22 public library systems and 9 3R regions (Reference and Research Library Resources Councils) are organized geographically. The key to developing regionalism is multi-directional communication. In order to create a statewide network and to communicate with the regions, an administrative unit at the State level could be most responsive if divided by function--a resource section, a collection development section, an interlibrary loan section, a communication and delivery section, and a budget section. The regions could then coordinate their plans through a  Statewide Advisory Council on Library Development composed of representatives from each of the regions, and all could then report to the Assistant Commissioner for Libraries.

The DBPH organization and operations and the associated regional library network are analyzed. The major objectives of the proposed system are defined as improved bibliographic control over materials acquired by DBPH and the network libraries and improved management control. To meet these objectives, DBPH Bibliographic Information System design contains three subsystems: (1) an in-process system, (2) a union catalog system, and (3) a management information system. Hardware, software, and support requirements are assessed as part  of a three-year plan for implementation. Appendixes include detailed work flow diagrams for current DBPH functions, a structured interview sheet used on site visits, and detailed calculations of production costs for the union catalog in book and microfiche form.

Each course is divided into independent segments of instruction and students have open-entry and exit options. This document reviews the processes utilized in selecting courses to be modularized, deciding on the instructional units for each course, and choosing the instructional methods to be used. Outlines of the modules for each course are presented, as are the pre- and post-testing procedures, comparisons of student achievement before and after the implementation of the modularized system, and student and faculty opinions of the new approach. Methods used for  scheduling, registration, awarding credit, computing GPA, and meeting graduation requirements are also discussed. Conclusions based on the comparisons and opinions indicate that: (1) fewer units were awarded under the new approach; (2) modularization is more expensive in terms of equipment and instructor time; (3) modularization requires the instructor to work more closely with other departments in determining course content; and (4) students liked the ability to finish the course early, but they disliked the lack of teacher pressure in setting deadlines.

This document represents an interim report on the progress of the study. Procedures included analyzing existing manpower and student interest data, verifying this information with local employment offices and employers in the four counties of the area, consulting with a Steering Committee of area residents, and administering a questionnaire survey to determine the interests of local individuals in enrolling in specific programs. Specific recommendations are made as to the types of programs needed and the curricula to be included in each program. The author recommends the establishment of Lower Shore Community  College (LSCC), a &quot;community college without walls&quot;, which would utilize existing facilities in the area. The college would be vocational-technical in its orientation. Services would be provided on a contract basis by existing institutions and LSCC would have coordinating and administrative responsibilities only, thereby maximizing cost-effectiveness. A proposed operating budget for LSCC is appended, as are the student interest questionnaire and a list of program priorities and locations. (Author/DC)",

The opportunities for providing two lecturers stressing their topical specialties in group discussions seemed preferable to the traditional lecture (TL) class which enrolls 60 to 80 students. However, between fall 1970 and fall 1973, student interest and enrollment in JL sections continuously declined. In order to compare the relative benefits of JL and TL instruction, grade reports were obtained for the 1,006 JL students and the 1,525 TL students who had enrolled in History 27 from fall 1970 to fall 1973. Results indicate higher retention rates for  the TL classes and no significant differences in student academic performance. Analysis of registration counts showed that the TL approach attracted students more readily than the JL approach. Possible reasons for these findings are discussed and a review of the literature relating to student motivational preferences for various teaching methods and a bibliography are provided. The authors also make recommendations for improving JL team-teaching ventures at Cerritos. (DC)",

Only two percent engaged in political activity full-time, while 13 percent and four percent spent one or two hours and three or four hours per day, respectively. Fifty percent used the recess to work at some kind of non-political, paying job (30 percent full-time and 20 percent part-time). Seventy-two percent spent from one to four hours per day studying, while 15 percent spent more than four hours per day in this activity. Sixty-eight percent rejected the view  that the recess enabled them to do much more political work than would have been possible had classes been held as usual. Sixty-one percent considered the recess ineffective in making a contribution toward a political or community action program. Thirty-five percent favored similar recesses in the future, while 45 percent did not. Responses are classified according to several dimensions and the questionnaire is appended. (DC)",

        "description":"In fall 1970, the liberal arts curriculum at Bronx Community College (New York) was revised to provide more flexibility for student program structuring. Analyses of cumulative student progress data for pre- and post-revision students indicate that the revision was successful in increasing persistence and graduation rates; it also seems to have led to higher student GPA's and fewer credits earned. An opinion survey sent to 200 liberal arts faculty members who had been at BCC continuously since fall 1968 yielded 46 responses. In general, faculty respondents felt that the revisions had weakened the structure and academic content of the curriculum; student motivation had not increased and the elimination of prerequisites allowed a higher proportion of inadequately prepared students  into the courses. A survey sent to students who had entered the liberal arts program in fall 1968 and who had continued to attend after fall 1970 indicated that the new flexibility operated mainly by enabling students to avoid taking unwanted courses rather than by enabling them to experiment in new areas. A large proportion of the respondents felt that they had not been sufficiently informed of the opportunities opened up by the revisions and had not been assisted in making use of the revisions in program planning.

The student is asked to indicate his or her ethnic group from among those groups listed on the card (American Indian, Black, Caucasian, Cuban-American, Puerto Rican, Mexican-American, Oriental-American, Other Spanish-Surnamed American, or Other). Each fall, a number of students report themselves in the &quot;Other&quot; category. In completing the card, the student is asked to specify the other ethnic group in which membership is claimed. Occasionally a student will make two responses to the ethnic question, indicating membership in one of the listed ethnic groups and also in the &quot;Other&quot; category. As a by-product  of the fall 1974 registration process, 337 student ethnic cards with single and double responses to the &quot;Other&quot; category were forwarded to the Office of Institutional Research and Evaluation; of these, 294 (83.7 percent) were single responses and 43 (12.8 percent) were double responses. Analyses reveal that only 13.6 percent of those students responding to the &quot;Other&quot; category truly belong in that category.

The first section reviews admissions requirements, concurrent high school-community college enrollments, re-entry procedures, residency requirements, and minimum course load requirements for veterans benefits and social security recipients. A section on fee structure reviews the establishment and use of student fees. A review of student financial aid policies reports  methods of needs determination, the eligibility of part-time students for financial aid, and EOPS student course load requirements. The report concludes that community colleges vary regarding the manner in which their fee structures, admission policies, and financial aid policies apply to part-time students; that community colleges attempt to be equitable in the way they meet the needs of full-time and part-time students, but that financial constraints often limit the extent to which part-time students can be served; and that a more detailed study of community college policies and procedures relating to part-time students is needed.

It notes the current drift of community college students away from the humanities and other transfer curricula and toward vocational and occupational training. Overall enrollment trends are noted, as are the characteristics of particular kinds of students to be served by two-year college humanities courses. Transfer, terminal, pragmatic, honors, adult, and minority students, senior citizens, working and married students, and part-time students are considered in separate sections. The impact of each of these student groups on humanities curricula is detailed. Suggestions for further study and an extensive bibliography are included. (DC)",

A questionnaire eliciting opinion on EL assessment methods and philosophy was distributed to 595 faculty members at 54 two- and four-year institutions. The questionnaire contained five statements from the behaviorist position and five from the cognitive constructionist position. Faculty were asked to respond using a six point modified Likert scale ranging from \"strong support\" to \"strong opposition.\" Usable responses were received from 114 respondents who were involved in the assessment of EL and 68 who were not. Results indicated that the faculty who assess EL tend to  take the cognitive constructionist position, while those who do not tend to take the behaviorist position. A literature review is included and the survey instrument is appended. (Author/DC)",

        "description":"The concept of impact, as it is treated in this report, is based on the notion of &quot;expected changes in student behavior and attitudes as contrasted to &quot;actual&quot; changes. Following a review of the literature on college impact and a discussion of its relevance to the two-year college, this document presents an empirical model for analysis of impact in the community college, isolates and identifies key variables that account for such impact, and presents guidelines for maximizing the positive impact of community colleges. The model for assessing impact is designed as an input-output model. The eight characteristics identified as factors related to community college impact are described as &quot;input characteristics&quot;; an &quot;expected output&quot; based on these factors can be determined through  observation and analysis of behavioral and attitudinal changes shown by matriculated students. The major conclusion is that the impact of a two-year college on its students is proportional to the degree of continuity between the college and the community; at present, community colleges have minimal impact on students because student and institutional value orientations are often nonintersecting and sometimes even conflict. The guidelines for maximizing positive impact detail methods of coordinating these disparate value orientations. A model for the assessment of community and institutional goals and a list of selected instruments to be used in such assessments are included. (Author/DC)",

All students had the same instructor, and all students were assigned traditional grades according to the same criteria; only the student and the Records Office knew of the student's choice of Pass/Fail or traditional grading. Results of comparing the grades of all 61 Pass/Fail students against those of all 61 traditionally graded students indicated no significant difference between the two groups. However, when the variables of sex, intelligence (IQ),  academic achievement (GPA), class status, course load, and college major (stratified random sample) were controlled, the course grade means were significantly different at the .05 level of confidence, suggesting that students who elect to take a course Pass/Fail may not be as motivated to learn as those who choose to be graded conventionally.

A response rate of 43 percent was obtained. Results identified 64.5 percent of the respondents as potential learners. Many of these were willing to learn in traditional way (30 percent), in traditional schools and colleges (43 percent), in the evenings (56 percent), and for at least one full semester (66 percent). The remainder expressed interest in new, nontraditional delivery systems not yet provided in the area. Because 74 percent desired some kind of credit for their work, the delivery system designed  to serve them must provide a means for crediting nontraditional types of learning. The major access barriers include time, cost, full-time attendance requirements, and home and job responsibilities. Most potential learners were interested in vocational subjects, hobbies and recreational subjects, and personal development subjects. Although most respondents held positive attitudes about the college, many felt inadequately informed about its activities. Recommendations are made for meeting the needs for nontraditional learning opportunities and for improvements in information services. The questionnaire is appended. (DC)",

Since the establishment of the college in 1946, the Board has had very few changes in membership; the trustees have served very long terms and reflect the white, rural outlook at the community's past. The community has since become suburban, with a large ethnic population. In January 1975, the Executive Board of the Faculty Association organized a 20-member Political Action Committee (PAC) to facilitate a plan for selecting candidates for faculty endoresment for the March 1975 elections, when three seats on the Board of Trustees would be open. PAC formed a coalition with the La Raza Faculty Association (LRFA) for the mutual endorsement of one  Chicano candidate chosen by LRFA and one chosen by PAC. They interviewed candidates, developed a campaign committee, obtained funding from the political arm of the California Teachers Association, surveyed trustees to determine present representation and philosophies, and surveyed faculty to determine their opinions of faculty involvement in political action. However, the PAC failed to gain wide faculty support or to sustain campaign participation, and the endorsed candidates did not win. Results of the faculty survey showed that most of the faculty did not favor the concept behind the PAC. The questionnaires are appended. (DC)",

Subjects were 54 black and 54 white kindergartens of high socioeconomic status. Sociodramatic play is defined as play in which a child takes on a role, elaborates a theme in cooperation with at least one other role player, and interacts with at least one other child both actively and verbally. Play ability was evaluated in terms of six elements: imitative role play, persistence, interaction, verbal communication, and make-believe in regard to objects and situations. Each group of four subjects (two boys and two girls) was studied for one 30-minute period in a special playroom with housekeeping, grocery store, and doctor's  office areas. Each child's mental ability was measured immediately after the play period using the Goodenough Drawing Test. Black subjects played significantly better than whites, but no significant relationship was found between IQ scores and level of sociodramatic play. (ED)",

Research at the Children's Unit of the Eastern Pennsylvania Psychiatric Institute (which focused on children's aggression and gender formation) is described. This research indicates that even \"good\" mothers, because of lack of formal and technical training for parenthood, too often do not understand their child's attachment to them and so are unable to handle even normal conflicts. Based on this assumption, some parameters of \"good-enough\" mothering are defined. Examples from clinical encounters with mother-child groups are used to support the contention that adequate education for parenthood must be  incorporated into high school curricula. (ED)",

First, child care and early education are discussed in their historical contexts from a social-systems point of view. After these general considerations, the scope of the needs of young children in Monroe County is analyzed, using the 1970 census, with consideration for both users and providers. Several previously conducted needs assessment surveys of specific user groups are summarized (RCA and Bloomington Hospital employers, personnel directors in local industry, and Head Start families). The procedures for data collection used in the present survey are described, the major effort being directed towards administration of questionnaires to  both directors and parents of children in full- and part-day centers and kindergarten. Results of the survey are given and alternative strategies for dealing with the issues raised by the survey are suggested.

        "description":"This paper describes a series of longitudinal experiments which dealt with the development of object awareness in infants, ages 6-18 months. The experiments were designed to document and evaluate Piaget's account of this development. The studies focused on two types of phenomena: (1) when infants first find an object hidden in one place, they will search at that place even when the object has been hidden at a second place; and (2) in terms of a system of levels, infants' responses to seeing one object disappear, and finding another in its place. Examination of the two types of phenomena generally supported Piaget's notion of an intermediate level of object awareness, one where infants sense a definite but diffuse connection between successive appearances of objects in time and  space. The need for clarification of Piaget's hypothesis concerning the nature of object awareness during this period is noted. (ED)",

A series of four dimensional tasks and a conservation task were administered to 25 kindergarten girls and 25 kindergarten boys. The dimensional tasks tested understanding of comparative and superlative terms along one and two dimensions and the ability to define the relevant dimension in a given situation. A scalogram analysis indicated the existence of a developmental sequence consisting of understanding relational terms along one dimension, defining the relevant dimension, coordinating relational terms along two dimensions, and conservation. The sequence was valid for girls, but was only a &quot;quasi-scale&quot; rather than a true sequence for boys due  to more variability in the boys' response pattern. (ED)",

The report addresses the following questions: (1) Was participation in Head Start a factor in preventing retention in grade and/or special class placement? (2) Were there differences between Head Start and non-Head Start children on achievement measures upon reaching the sixth grade level? (3) What was the efficiency of a battery of psychoeducational tests administered at the beginning of first grade in prediction of academic achievement in the sixth grade? and (4) Did this battery of tests assist in the discrimination between children who progressed normally through the grades and those who were retained or placed in special classes?  Preschool test results (from children exiting Head Start in 1966 and their non-Head Start counterparts) were compared to the results of the Lorge-Thorndike intelligence quotients and the Metropolitan Readiness Test (MRT) (for the same children in the sixth grade). Results showed that a significantly smaller percentage of Head Start children than non-Head Start children had been placed in special education classes or retained in grade; though there were no significant differences in academic achievement at the sixth grade level. Also demonstrated was the possibility predicting a high percentage of children who will fail to progress as expected in elementary schools; the MRT provided for a large percentage of this potential prediction.

The critique focuses on the dual aspects of interpretation and application for the three programs analyzed: (1) David Weikart's Cognitively Oriented Curriculum; (2) Celia S. Lavatelli's Early Childhood Curriculum: A Piaget Approach; and (3) Constance Kamii's and Rheta DeVries' Piaget for Early Education. Piaget's epistemology is reviewed with reference to his views on the nature of subject-object relationship, the construction of operations, the  nature of physical and logico-mathematical knowledge, and the representation of knowledge. Each of the three curricula is analyzed according to these epistemological foundations. (ED)",

Process and product modules used in conjunction with field work made up the curriculum. Teachers were trained to facilitate learning in both normal and handicapped children in regular classrooms. Procedures and instruments used for evaluating the program and the separate modules are discussed. The experimental  group (10 original trainees) and two control groups (10 students each from traditional early childhood and special education teacher preparation programs) were compared to evaluate the program's effectiveness. The trainees were found to perform equally as well as their student counterparts. Some conclusions relative to the Comfield Model's effectiveness are presented. Data tables are included. (ED)",

Individuals, organizations, and tribes have come to the decision that libraries and the information services which they offer are necessary to meet Indian goals. Although these goals may vary widely from improved access to education, cultural information, information on available social services, to leisure reading, they are all based in a component or institution designed to process information--a library. Eleven guides have been developed to summarize the state-of-the-art in Indian librarianship in a series of brief, practical guides. Each guide discusses basic policies, initial steps, or discreet activities essential to successful Indian library service. The guides present three  basic types of information: societal coping skills, basic considerations for implementation, and descriptions of services unique or critical to Indian libraries. Guide 1 briefly discusses establishing initial contacts with the Indian community. It emphasizes how to cope with societal differences in Indian communities. Definitions are given for library, information, and Indian community. Five sources for further reading are also cited. (NQ)",

Along with the tribes, individuals and organizations are also recognizing that libraries and the information services which they offer are necessary to meet Indian goals. The organization, staffing, and programming for Indian library services, while basically similar to library services everywhere, involve certain special problems and unique situations. This booklet, third in a series of guides designed to provide initial direction and alternatives to those planning or developing Indian library and information systems, discusses some basic considerations in library governance, interrelationships with governmental units, and staff considerations.

Many of these Indians belong to a lower socioeconomic sector and are often discriminated against in housing, education, employment, health services, and law enforcement. Away from the protections of their own cultures and repressed in the majority culture, they have a special need for reinforcement of self-esteem. Information and referral services can help provide solutions to their everyday needs, thus assisting them to become more productive members of society. The library can furnish a variety of Indian materials to help meet these varying needs. Guide 5, one of 11 guides designed to provide initial direction and alternatives to those planning or developing  Indian library and information systems, briefly discusses some basic considerations which need to be kept in mind when implementing library services for urban Indian populations. Among the topics are: library responsibility, role of Indian organizations, location of services, personnel, model services, and cooperation with schools and social services.

In its 4th year of operation, the project (funded under Elementary and Secondary Education Title III) involved 725 Indian students in grades K-3 at St. Charles Mission, Hotevilla, Sells, Rice, and Many Farms and in K-4 at Sacaton and Peach Springs. For the project's fourth evaluation, all the students were administered the pre and posttest SRA Reading Achievement tests and the DISTAR Mastery tests. A minimum of 2 visits were made to all sites, except Hotevilla, during the year. Some of the project's successes were; (1) significant gains were  attained at all schools; (2) changes in average grade level equivalence ranged from 4 to 7 months; and (3) in terms of national posttest norms, only 1 school achieved as high as the national median score of the 50th percentile. This report covers 3 basic areas of the evaluation: (1) reading performance by SRA (WRAT) and DISTAR Reading Mastery test; (2) development of reading objectives; and (3) cultural awareness activities.

Central to development of REP strategy (Rural Futures Development Strategy) are the following assumptions: (1) school improvements are longer lasting and more effective if those affected take part in the decision making process; (2) a comprehensive plan produces enduring improvements; (3) improvement of community communication, problem solving, and decision making skills increases the likelihood of positive action, local leadership, and  group motivation; (4) a &quot;process&quot; person (outside consultant) facilitates group work and enhances the potential for reaching goals; (5) group projection of a desirable future is a better 1st step than identification of problems and concerns; (6) consultative assistance (facilitation) is more positive when it builds independence rather than dependence. Based on these principles, REP resource materials, training plans, and products include guides for schools, school board development, school-community groups, the training of process facilitators, etc. (JC)",

Designed as regional in nature to allow for a sharper focus on the area's Athabascan culture, the workshop was attended by 15 teachers from Independent school districts, Bureau of Indian Affairs schools, and Alaska State Operated Schools. These teachers represented both elementary and secondary levels, various discipline areas (science, social studies, language arts), and new and seasoned teachers who were actually doing multicultural and community-oriented things as part of their regular, everyday curriculum. This report presents: (1) 12 papers presented  by the participants; (2) ideas and strategies brought out in conversation and summarized for easier reading; and (3) a listing of materials such as teacher and student references, Canadian materials, films, kits, newspapers, records, video tapes, funding sources, and Cross-Cultural Educational Development Program (X-CED) materials.

The practitioner has the responsibility of making its definition useful--precise and comprehensive. For Alaska, a useful definition of &quot;bilingual education&quot; must be flexible enough to meet the specific needs of each community. Two things must be considered: (1) the bilingual situation in a particular community and (2) the kind of language program appropriate to that situation. This paper explores the usefulness of various definitions of &quot;bilingual education&quot;, emphasizing their meaningfulness for multiple audiences, consumers as well as educational and political practitioners in Alaska's multilingual environment.

        "description":"In Fall 1971, the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs' (BIA) Bethel Agency implemented an experimental Yupik bilingual program into the primary grades of 3 lower Kuskokwim village day schools. Simultaneously the Alaska State-Operated School System (ASOSS) introduced Yupik bilingual programming in a kindergarten classroom at Bethel Elementary School. Both agencies shared certain program components (mainly in the areas of staff and materials development), and many of the concepts generated by the BIA were subsequently incorporated by the ASOSS bilingual program. This report presents the evaluation and research findings of the first 3 years of both the BIA and ASOSS programs. In some cases, data are given for only one of the agency programs; however, where program similarity justifies,  data are generalized to estimate conditions and outcomes for both agencies. Data range from formal language test data to impressionistic data where staff and community members were informally interviewed. An overview of bilingual education is given, defining its spectrum and listing the BIA and ASOSS programs and where on the spectrum they exist. The main program components (instruction, staff development, materials development, and community involvement) are analyzed by addressing prominent operational and theoretical questions which arose during the programs' first 3 years.

Among the reasons for increases in rural areas and small towns are: (1) decentralization of manufacturing and other industry; (2) increased settlement of retired people; (3) expansion of State colleges; (4) more recreation activity; and (5) apparent higher birth rate in nonmetro areas. Also, urban areas have become less appealing to many people, for under conditions of general affluence, low total population growth, easy transportation and communication, modernization of rural life, and urban population massings so large that the advantages of urban life are diminished, a downward shift to smaller communities may  seem both feasible and desirable. Much new thought, therefore, is needed on the probable course of future population distribution in the United States, uncolored either by value-laden residential fundamentalism or by outmoded analytical premises.

Since Nebraska had more one-teacher schools (626 in 1971-72) than any other state, 110 one-room schools with an enrollment of 10 or more students in grades 1 through 6 or 8 were selected. In April and May 1973, questionnaires were administered to 110 teachers and 1,405 students throughout the State. Two student questionnaires were used--one for grades 1-3 and one for grades 4-8. Teacher questionnaires consisted of 46 items, 5 of which were open-ended questions. Data were not obtained from kindergarten children, severely handicapped students, or absent students. Some of the findings were: (1) approximately 34  of the 110 schools had students tutoring other students on a regular basis; (2) teachers used peer tutoring primarily for the benefit of the tutees, to provide them with individual, academic help; (3) the large majority of tutees were in grades 1 through 5; (4) in the lower grades boys and girls were tutors equally often, while in the upper 4 grades girls were much more likely than boys to be tutors; and (5) 25 percent of the teachers selected students with weak self-confidence and 79 percent selected students of good achievement.

        "description":"Over 1,100 community and junior colleges are currently enrolling students in the United States. In Arizona, California, Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado where the proportion of the population is about 20 percent Spanish speaking, there are about 210 two-year colleges. Studies indicate that 75 percent of all Mexican Americans attending post-secondary education are enrolled in community colleges. In 1971, there were 121,897 students enrolled in Texas community colleges; of these, 17,893 (14.6 percent) were Mexican Americans. Yet, few 2-year colleges report any significant progress in bilingual-bicultural education. The El Paso Community College is one of the few which has achieved some degree of success in bilingual-bicultural programs. It has pursued an instructional improvement  phase which focuses on the development of a competency-based, learner-oriented model of instruction in which faculty development is essential. This paper discusses the learner-oriented model being developed at El Paso Community College. (NQ)",

        "description":"Utilizing data derived from numerous sources (institutions, Alaska Native organizations, Federal and State agencies, conferences, etc.), this descriptive study is divided into 6 chapters which trace the evolution of and the necessity for Alaska Native higher education. Following a detailed introduction, Chapter 2 describes the physical and environmental setting of Alaska and its various ethnic groups (Aleuts; Tlingits, Haidas, and Tsimshians; Eskimos; and Athabascans). Chapter 3 provides historical analysis (1741-1972) of the socio-political changes relative to Native educational development resulting from contact with Euro-American cultures (the Russian period, the American missions, the &quot;government missions&quot;, and the evolution and dismantlement of the Native and non-Native 2  school system). Chapter 4 details the influence of Statehood and the land claims movement on the evolution of the Alaska Native's need and/or desire for cultural survival and ethnic self-determination. Documenting the lack of Alaska Native participation in the social affairs of the State, Chapter 5 emphasizes the relationship between higher education and social participation via examination of: public and private institutions; higher education and the Alaska Native peoples; a profile of the Native college student; special institutional programs; the educational needs and the future of Alaska Native higher education.

Data were derived from &quot;North Central Quarterly&quot; reports. Examination of rural high school demographic setting and enrollment size included 1969 and 1974 comparisons of: (1) demographic setting of NCA high schools; (2) sample of 15 Iowa local school districts with population of major town under 5,000 or high school enrollment less than 500; (3) distribution of NCA high schools by enrollment groups; (4) mean enrollment of NCA high schools and grade groupings; (5) number and percent of NCA standard high schools by demographic setting and size of high school. Quality indicators examined included 1969 and 1974  comparisons of: (1) NCA high schools with enrollments of less than 200 with those of 200 to 499 in terms of enrollment, number of schools, average pupil/professional ratio, average number of full time guidance workers, and average per pupil library expenditure and (2) average annual salaries of principals and superintendents in schools of less than 500 enrollment and beginning teacher salaries of all NCA high schools. It was concluded that high schools of less than 500 constitute a significant group in the NCA, meet the same quality standards as larger schools, and reflect the &quot;ideal&quot; size. (JC)",

These processes at different times and in different social settings are shown to be related to each other through specific historic continuities and through the common neurological nature of mankind. Humans seem to be innately programmed to spontaneously generate symbols and mental structures through emotion-bearing communications within small social groups. Understanding these universal and innate human propensities helps us to understand why there are strong continuities in some dimensions of culture and massive changes in other dimensions while the cultural system as a whole  undergoes cultural evolution. Humans, viewed from the point of view of the ethology of human individuals, have kept reproducing very similar social-ideological structures while the broader cultural system has evolved to increasingly integrate a global society.

Unfortunately, \"rural\" and \"rural education\" are often discussed as if they were separate entities. Actually they are inextricably interwoven, for those very factors which describe rurality very much determine rural education. Documenting the still prevalent economic plight of rural populations, the 1967 report by the President's Commission on Rural Poverty details the following rural characteristics: relative isolation of communities; prevailing cultural level; relative population decline; scarcity of leadership; inadequate tax base; economically irrelevant political boundaries; shortage of well qualified personnel; and resistance to change. Such factors have perpetuated the  inadequacies of rural public services, particularly schools. The inability of rural areas to support educational programs is readily reflected in their: inadequate facilities and instructional materials; disproportionate numbers of unqualified teachers; high teacher turnover rates; lack of effective special services; higher dropout rates; inadequately prepared graduates; high unemployment and underemployment rates; and few taxable resources. As the U.S. can no longer afford these rural American losses, a combination of national will and increased human and financial resources is required to solve these problems. (JC)",

Two Texas school districts of equal characteristics and size, with heavy Chicano enrollments were selected. In one, the faculty and administration reflected the student composition; in the other, they did not. The sample consisted of: 15 Chicano students and their parents, 15 teachers, and 15 administrators and members of the community power structure. Similar procedures were employed with both school districts. By using questionnaires and interviews on these selected groups, certain factors associated with lack of academic achievement of Chicano children  were identified. In the process, the Chicano value system, culture, family, self-concept and actual scholastic achievement were examined vis-a-vis the Anglo child. The investigation uncovered significant differences in values, role-concepts, self and familial-concepts, as possible factors that influence the educational behavior and achievement of Chicano children. Findings led to the conclusion that lack of achievement among Chicano children is attributed to various sources of conflict between them and the school. (Author/NQ)",

Utilizing Holmberg's methodology of contextual mapping and strategy intervention, Southern Utah State College (SUSC) is participating as technical advisor in the clarification of social problems, the search for program funding, and the organization and administration of special developmental projects on the Kaibab Reservation in Arizona. Initiation of the Kamunts Project involved informal socializing, attendance at formal tribal meetings, consultations with the Kaibab Tribal Chairman and Planner, establishment of a pilot project, and development of a research library. The social problems  identified involve maintenance of the social and cultural continuity of the Kaibab community via prevention of outmigration. Interventive attempts to alter this situation include SUSC assistance in a restoration project on the reservation, establishment of a museum to house restoration finds, and coordination of the museum with a teaching facility for purposes of promoting bilingual approaches to Paiute myths. At this point (1975), the project is experiencing success except for the fact that it is very much in need of additional funds. (JC)",

Designated the second largest source of income, reservation factories are also described in some detail (the manufacturing of moccasins, American Indian souvenirs, quilts, and hair accessories). Reduction of the number of individuals living in substandard housing (less than 60 percent as of 1972), is presented as evidence of improved housing efforts on the  reservation, while a 26-bed hospital and almost total sanitation services (90 percent) serve as evidence of improved health services.

Based on criteria of: significance; researchability; relevance to group decisions, actions, and applicability; reference to relevant reports; conference proceedings; and canvassing of relevant individuals and groups; the priority problem areas throughout the Northeast were identified as follows: (1) land use; (2) community services; (3) economic development; (4) local government and finance; (5) housing; (6) processes and strategies. Environmental quality and human resources were identified as lower priority areas. Willingness of researchers and  administrators to fit research activities into a total program that best utilizes personnel and facilities was deemed vital. The recommended total research program called for coordination between extension specialists and decision makers, emphasizing regional, rather than local, application and procedure. Suggested vehicles for mobilization of RD research included Northeast Center-14 (a project through which department heads collectively view and coordinate research) and the Northeast Regional Center for Rural Development, which, if adequately funded, could serve to unify research efforts.

Student changes were measured by growth scores with the following four criterion measures: Test on Understanding Science; Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal; A Scale to Measure Attitude Towards Any School Subject; and Student Perception of Teacher Style. The sample used in this study consisted of 471 undergraduates enrolled during the 1971-1972 academic year in the course called \"Thought and Structure in Physical Science\" at the University of Illinois. Twenty-six independent predictors were selected. High school and college backgrounds in science and mathematics as well as subscores on selected parts of ACT were included among the academic predictors.  Dogmatism, flexibility, tolerance, responsibility, and intellectual efficiency were among the predictors identified as personal factors. The collected data were treated using analysis of variance, analysis of covariance, and multiple regression techniques. Among the findings were that consideration of the personal and instructor variables significantly increased the ability to predict student changes and that it was apparent that there were abilities which were significant in predicting student changes other than those measured by standard achievement and intelligence tests.

Sixty children were used in the study. Levels of cognitive development were evaluated using four learning tasks and moral development was assessed by presenting four conflicting situations to each subject for discussion purposes. Recorded personnel interviews were used for the purpose of evaluation. The outcome of this study tended to confirm the position taken by others that cognitive development parallels or precedes moral development in the process of intellectual growth. The data indicated that children at a higher level of cognitive development were either at a correspondingly higher level or at a lower level of moral development. The  levels of moral development were not shown to advance significantly over the levels of cognitive development. (Author/EB)",

        "description":"The research of Jean Piaget and his Genevan co-workers might lead one to believe that all adolescents are formal thinkers by the time they are 15 or 16 years of age. The studies reviewed by the author on formal thinking in the United States seem to support the contention that the majority of late adolescents and adults function at the concrete operational level and not at the formal operational level. The data collected and the conclusions arrived at by the researchers indicate that over 50 percent of the American population at age 16 and older function at the concrete operational level, thus contradicting Piaget's findings resulting from research with Genevan subjects. The discrepancy here is probably due to the subjects studied by Piaget. He appears to have chosen the more able  students in his studies on formal thought development, hence finding greater cognitive development than he possibly would have found had he studied a truly random sample. If the cognitive development of late adolescents and adults has been accurately inferred from the studies cited, then it appears that many of our high school and college science courses are inappropriate. Since a great deal of the subject matter taught in high school and college science courses is geared toward formal thinking, these courses are not suited for concrete operational thinkers who probably represent the majority of students. It seems that curriculum developers need to develop science programs that are more geared toward concrete operational thinking than are the existing programs. (Author/BR)",

The sample consisted of 27 elementary education undergraduate students engaged in a biology course specifically designed to meet their needs. Inter-item correlation coefficients were calculated for all criteria, cognitive and noncognitive. The results indicate a high correlation between test grades and scores from a checklist of affective behaviors. Students' affective behavior scores also correlated comparatively high with achievement on laboratory and extraclass assignments. However, results indicate that a student's preference for biology did not correspond to any significant degree to his achievement in the  course. (Author/BR)",

        "description":"This study investigated a problem within the theoretical structure of cognitive development proposed by Jean Piaget, and used the concepts of classification and projective spatial relationships to investigate the nature of attainment and sequencing of three corresponding logical and infralogical groupings according to the models proposed by Piaget. Three classification and three logico-mathematically corresponding projective geometry (perspective) tasks were administered in a randomized order through individual interviews to 108 children born during the years 1962, 1963 and 1964. Subjects were chosen randomly to provide six equal groups of 18 according to birth year and sex. The oral presentations and responses were tape-recorded and transcribed. Silent responses were verbalized  by the interviewer to facilitate transcription. Data were analyzed by using a test for scalibility; a chi-square one-sample test was used to test for differences in performance (age level, sex, between each age level on the projective spatial relationship tasks). The results indicate that cognitive processes undergo continuous development with growing differentiation and coordination until the processes become completely functional when the concrete operational period merges with the beginnings of formal operational thought at possibly thirteen or fourteen years of age: two or three years later than the transitional period suggested by Piaget. The reason for the age difference in performance on the upper level of the concrete operational tasks is not clear. (Author/BR)",

In 1973, five seminars were held in different parts of the developing world. Each seminar was limited to 20-25 participants selected from five to nine countries. The participants received a set of questions which focused on four topics concerning population: (1) Population Problems, (2) Population Policies or Responses and Their Effects, (3) Policy Administration: Actors and Constituent Groups, and (4) Policy Options. The participants were asked to write a brief memorandom in response to the questions. The memorandum was to serve as a common point of departure for discussion and to prepare the  participants to examine population policy in a broad context. All five seminars followed an agenda based on the questions. At the end of each seminar, participants were asked to complete an evaluation questionnaire. Most participants said that they had gained a broader understanding of population policy. This book contains an introduction, the results of the five seminars: South Asia Seminar, Middle East Seminar, Latin America-Commonwealth Caribbean Seminar, Africa Seminar, and Southeast Asia Seminar, a summary, and committee reflections.

Future-oriented supplemental teaching materials are proposed as the most viable alternative available for achieving literacy in science within the present school curriculum, with a minimum of investment and with little or no retraining of present personnel. The proposal to use the future as an organizing principle is based on the recognition that future-oriented rules and procedures are an indigenous part of science, and that future projections and plans are a crucial part of our current social structure. Reference to the educational utility of future-oriented learning exercises is also made. Selected  samples of future-oriented, teacher-based materials are included, along with several samples of student-run projects, also future-oriented. The benefits and costs are described in terms of social utility, added benefit to the scientific community, and fundamental benefits to students. Finally, research questions are posed which focus on the assessment of science literacy, as defined, along with additional basic questions about students' ability to deal with future-oriented topics as a function of cognitive age, sex differences and cultural differences.

No significant differences were found in either achievement or attitude. Most students indicated a preference for the discussion over the worksheet.

Some of the questions explored were: Will early experience change the preservice teacher's commitment to science teaching and his attitude toward the teacher preparation program? Will it change the preservice teacher's view of the role and nature of science? Will it change their view of students or affect the preservice teacher's major concerns about his abilities and needs as a teacher and cause the teachers to express a need for a broader science background? The group used consisted of 31 students (primarily sophomores) who were  pre- and posttested with the Nature of Science Scale, the Teaching Profession Questionnaire and the World Association Scale. The results indicated that this early experience did not significantly alter commitments to science teaching, but it did significantly change their attitudes toward their education and science coursework, as well as generate increased concern about junior high students and their reading problems. A significant change occurred in the preservice teacher's view of the nature of science away from the theoretical model and a trend toward the broader selection of background in the science fields was indicated.

The primary purpose of the investigation was to document some of the behavioral and cognitive effects of wait-time and to delineate the interrelationships between the various forms of wait-time. The secondary purpose of the investigation was to study the expected inverse relationship between teacher scores on the Pupil Control Ideology Form and duration of natural teacher reaction Wait-Time. Fifty-one preservice teachers were used in this study; 31 were trained to use Teacher Reaction Wait-Times of about 0.5 seconds and 2.0 seconds with inner city elementary school children, while 20 teachers instructing junior  high students were randomly assigned to use the shorter or longer wait-times while using an inquiry science lesson. The results indicate that teachers can be taught a technique whereby they can increase the amount of student-to-student interactions in small groups during science inquiry and can bring about an increase in the frequency with which students spontaneously make verbal contributions to the group. More robust science inquiry can be facilitated with the increased use of time-wait. (Author/BR)",

The nature trail is an important tool for teaching environmental awareness and appreciation. It provides experiences for observing nature firsthand with all senses employed. It is a resource that is available to the entire school and is applicable to all curriculum areas. The purpose of this booklet is to provide information for teachers, administrators and students on how they may plan and develop a nature trail at their school. Locating the trail, trail construction, trail interpretation, and maintenance are covered in section 1. Section 2 focuses on art, science-math, language arts, and social studies activities which could  evolve from classroom use of the nature trail. Section 3 provides ideas and examples of trail topics such as a marsh trail, historical trail, wood trail, and geology trail. Examples of outdoor demonstrations and charts are also included in this section.

The paper contains eight sections, a bibliography, and five appendices. Section one deals with the definition of attitudes and environmental attitudes. Section two presents a justification for the use of television spot announcements. Section three explains the two populations who provided experimental samples: (1) seventh- and eighth-grade students and (2) eleventh- and twelfth-grade students. The production of spot announcements and consideration of the use policies of stations are considered in section four. Section five reviews the selection of the evaluation instrument which satisfies six criteria:  objectivity, relevancy, validity, sensitivity, comparability, and utility. Section six considers the semantic differential, a combination of associational and scaling procedures for measuring attitudinal shifts. Section seven focuses on the experimental design. A discussion of semantic differential data is included in the last section. (Author/TK)",

Despite its excellent resources for agriculture, the basin suffers from a number of problems related to water and agriculture, such as: (1) precipitation varies during the growing season, stimulating the demand to irrigate; (2) only 40 percent of the land has been treated by proper farming methods; and (3) the basin lacks water recreation areas. This study focuses on these problems. Four separate study areas within the basin identified. A random sample of respondents was drawn from each survey area. This population responded to a questionnaire of 23 to 24 Likert-type attitude statements and a page of demographic questions. Following the surveys,  programs to test methods of communication were commenced in each of the four survey regions. After the communication projects, another random sample was drawn from each area to test net attitude change. A number of conclusions were drawn from this survey, including: (1) attitudes surveyed tended to be generally favorable and (2) an average of 35 percent of re-interview respondents per statement changed their attitude between surveys. Appendices are included. (TK)",

The following report describes the investigation undertaken by Oklahoma State University (LSU) to survey and determine what extent the Oklahoma Cooperative Extension service might be utilized to help alleviate the problems. The investigation focused on three primary objectives: (1) identification of felt problems in Oklahoma, (2) identification of obstacles to the solutions, and (3) assessment of county and community decision making processes to determine which environmental transfer  methods might be most effective. From this information the OSU team designed a pilot program for an Environmental Extension Service through the Oklahoma Cooperative Extension. Several recommendations arose from this investigation, such as: (1) federal agencies should support Environmental Extension Programs; (2) the Oklahoma Cooperative Extension should be involved in a pilot program; and (3) both federal and state agencies should support such a project with funds.

The study engages in a brief review of earlier research in order to examine the validity of two assumptions--that the construction and/or the use of a tactic that simplifies a learning task is one of the most critical prerequisites for successful performance, and that differences in elaborative facility and in preferences among particular kinds of elaborative tactics are responsbile for a major share of observed differences in learning proficiency. On the basis of these two assumptions, the study focuses on: (1) features of persons that can be established independent of the learning task on which performances are to be observed, such  as sex, chronological age, IQ, and socioeconomic status-ethnicity; and (2) characteristics of learners that are endogenous to the task whereby learning proficiency is estimated, i.e. individual variables in particular learning tasks. The results evaluated are considered to indicate that a learning task might be a better predictor of long-term school learning than a test of the IQ variety.

Authoritative opinions of speech differences between black ghetto and standard dialect were used as the basis for constructing test items that were subsequently administered to groups of disadvantaged black students and middle class white students. The criteria for item validity rested on the extent to which individual  items could discriminate between the groups. Ninety-six of the 123 items reached the five percent level of significance.

Students from three schools saw 12 films of six black professionals and six white professionals on a once-a-week basis. Controls who saw no films were drawn from each school. Another school saw only six black films on a weekly basis, while its control was a school from a similar nieghborhood which saw no films. Students who saw films changed significantly following the films in terms of their evaluation of white photographs, with lower socioeconomic males becoming more negative toward white faces following the films. Experimentals also changed  significantly in their rejection of attitudes of white superiority, while controls moved in the opposite direction, showing less racial pride over time. No differences between experimentals and controls appeared in terms of desired goals or predicted success. The results are held to support the hypothesis that the first change in terms of a more positive self-concept among Negroes may be a more negative attitude toward whites as they attempt to explode the myth of white superiority for themselves and redirect hostility previously turned inward toward self.

        "description":"Education vouchers are a means of providing money directly to parents enabling them to pay for their children's education at the school of their choice, public or private. Three important ground rules are part of the present proposal: (1) no school should be able to charge parents tuition in addition to the voucher amount, thus preventing discrimination against the poor; (2) all students would be given an unbiased chance for admission to schools of their choice; and, (3) all participating schools should provide parents with enough information to enable the latter to make an informed choice among schools for their children. Schools that enroll poor children should receive an extra incentive in the form of extra money. Racial discrimination would be forbidden. Parochial schools  could participate without violation of the United States Constitution because parents and not the government would choose where to spend the voucher funds; or, voucher funds could be limited to secular education expenses. The Office of Economic Opportunity is considering funding a five year demonstration project of education vouchers in some urban area. Exact details of a plan for local implementation must be worked out at the local level and with the Office of Economic Opportunity. (JM)",

        "description":"Relationships were studied between classroom racial balance (the evenness with which minority group students are distributed over classes in a grade) and the interracial attitudes of grade 3 students. Students took three attitude tests designed to measure different components of children's interracial attitudes: the Sociometric Choice Measure, the Classroom Preference Test, and The People Test. On the Sociometric Choice Measure, students most often nominated peers of their own race; on the Classroom Preference Test, students most often selected teachers and classmates of their own race; and, results for The People Test showed that both race and sex were used as criteria for the distances between stimulus figures--but that balance reduced the between figure distances deriving from  sex and race. On the first two measures, too, interracial attitudes were more favorable in balanced than in unbalanced classes. Results of the study are held to show that racial balance index are clearly related to students' interracial attitudes. It is suggested that this index may prove useful as a way of differentiating between more and less successful instances of school integration. Tables of test results are appended. (RJ)",

The second expectation is that vocational education must place all young people who do not go on to a 4-year college program on a rung of the employment ladder, including those who learn slowly. The third expectation of the public is that vocational education must respond to a situation in which: (1) High school continues to be the only transition to the world of work for 60 percent of our young people, (2) The number of jobs which the unskilled  can fill is rapidly declining, and (3) The number of jobs requiring a liberal arts education is increasing far less rapidly than the number demanding a technical skill.

Data were collected by a literature review, correspondence with administrators of prerelease programs, and questionnaires distributed to state and federal correctional institutions. Information on a variety of experimental programs was collected. One was the work-release concept which allows the inmate to be employed in a nearby community and return to the institution at night. Furloughs permit prisoners to visit a designated place or places for a period not to exceed 30 days and return to the institution at the end of that period, and  half-way houses provide a place to live and other types of assistance to ex-inmates immediately after their release from prison. Other types of experimental programs are open institutions, reception center parole, and intensive community treatment.

In the early 1960's the manpower information emphasis began to shift from improvement and expansion of data input to efficient management of data output. Factors responsible for this emphasis shift were: (1) rapid expansion of \"active manpower policy\" legislation, (2) increasing  heterogenity of manpower statistics sources, (3) interdisciplinary aspects, (4) introduction of planning, programing, and budgeting systems, and (5) labor market mechanisms. Information systems have been developed, but most are directed to the internal labor market of companies and government agencies. Only a few are nationwide, and these are limited to specialized and selected manpower groups. A more comprehensive nationwide data storage-retrieval system is feasible, but there are certain ethical and technological problems requiring solutions. (SB)",

After analysis of present manpower resources and future requirements, educational and training needs, training programs and opportunities, and personnel utilization and recruitment it was concluded that: (1) Total industry and government demands for engineers and scientists will probably exceed the supply for the next several years, (2) There is a continuing need for upgrading and updating professional skills through short-course training, and (3) Existing programs for the training of sewage treatment plant  operators are inadequate in both quality and quantity. Some corrective actions to be effected by the Federal Water Pollution Control Administration (FWPCA) include: (1) continue FWPCA financial support of programs for training graduate students in specific water pollution control disciplines, (2) encourage and assist states in placing greater emphasis on training, and (3) improve the conditions of employment for operators of waste treatment plants.

To accomplish these objectives, greater knowledge is needed concerning the participation, characteristics, and motivation of those dropouts who participate in vocational education. Of an estimated 14,258 Wisconsin male dropouts for 1966-67, this study identified only 600 dropouts or 4 percent who were enrolled in vocational education programs. A sample of 286 completed a forced-choice questionnaire to determine demographic characteristics (age, race, marital status, socioeconomic class), geographic mobility patterns, educational attainment, work experience, attitudes about vocational education, and achievement motivation. The sample represented  private voluntary vocational schools, public compulsory vocational plus basic schools, and public voluntary total education schools. The best explanation for the low percentage of enrollment is that not all available vocational programs are accessible to high school dropouts. Too often prohibitive educational or test requirements and tuition discourage dropout participation. (CH)",

Data were scored by both sets of weights to determine the percentage of males correctly classified according to occupation by each weighting scheme. The findings indicate that the chi-square weights are superior to the Kuder weights for distinguishing among similar occupations: optometrist, pediatrician, veterinarian, physical therapist, and X-ray technician. The total number of  subjects in similar occupations was 1,902. An improper scoring key was used to determine the percentages which were based on Kuder weights for dissimilar occupations; therefore the findings for dissimilar occupations were discounted. The dissimilar occupations were clinical psychologist, social case worker, optometrist, forester, and auto mechanic. Double cross-validation studies of the chi-square derived weights indicate that they are general in nature and not just indicative of the sample upon which the present study was based. (CH)",

Relevant works are designated in two categories: (1) the study of population characteristics and, (2) the description and evaluation of programs and practices. Studies within the former area are further categorized as investigations of performance and of life conditions. In the area of programs and practices, the focus of newer research is considered as emphasizing the role of the educational experience in producing the observed dysfunctions in performance. Research in the area of population characteristics is held to be rather well-designed and detailed. In contrast, the description and evaluation of educational programs and  practices for the disadvantaged are considered generally superficial.

The multiple, complex relations of governments on varying levels and the existence and independent sponsorship of important private association, industrial, academic and other libraries impose severe problems for any cooperative movement. A far-reaching investigation and a study in-depth of all the factors affecting interlibrary cooperation are essential as a first step in any cooperative program. Thus, this study was undertaken to: (1) assess needs for cooperative planning and action among the various types of libraries (public, Federal, university, school and special) in the metropolitan area and (2) prepare a design for subsequent research and demonstration in the areas of need. The  objective was to design needed studies not evaluate programs. Over 50 in-depth interviews with people knowledgeable in the field were conducted to assess needs and assign priorities to those needs. Chapter I establishes the background of the study. Chapter II summarizes the individual areas recommended for subsequent research in interlibrary cooperation and action. The interrelationships of the component research programs are analyzed and requirements for manpower, finances and phasing of research effort recommended. Chapter III serves as a guide for implementing the recommended research design in library cooperation. (NH)",

Two related parts give findings of questionnaire surveys and interviews in ten middle-sized New York State urban areas, and findings of a national study based on interviews, visits, and current literature. The national study indicates a general trend in American society toward applying knowledge to solve social problems and in social action. Specific movements in the use of continuing education by noneducational institutions are reported, along with its progress to a more central role in educational institutions. Developments in national continuing education associations are sketched, including both obstacles to cooperation and  trends toward common interests. An approach to common ground is suggested. Ten steps to improve the field of continuing education are recommended. It is concluded that continuing education needs a strategy for making a cumulative impact. Appendixes describe local survey methods and details of the results.

        "description":"This survey concentrated on evaluating the present structure of public school adult education (PSAE) in Massachusetts, adult access to education throughout the state, characteristics of local programs, and possible future directions. Analyses were made of the history, objectives, and policies of 100 local programs, followed by student body, curriculum, administrative and other personnel, recruitment, publicity, other adult education sponsors, financial support and budgeting, problems, and evaluation and planning. Major findings included enrollment of barely 1% of all undereducated adults, limited and nonsequential curriculums, leadership needs, and educational involvement of under 1/7 of the total adult population. Adult education needs were not being met at any level, and access  tended to be limited to those with more money, time, transportation, and education. It was suggested that, for $1,200,000 a year, a comprehensive system could be developed to coordinate existing state programs, restore and expand university extension (cut out in 1965), develop resource centers and teacher/administrator training programs, and aid curriculum development and research.

In some other countries there are inadequate private regulatory bodies (United Kingdom) or incomplete government supervision (Italy). Malpractices continue to flourish and in some countries (Italy, Austria, and Switzerland) it is easy for unregulated foreign schools to operate. In France there is no regulation and the need is felt badly. The Federal Republic of Germany is in the process of setting up a central authority for supervision. Although in Sweden there  is no supervision, standards are high. In Turkey, correspondence education is virtually a state monopoly; although, as yet, on a limited scale, it seems excellently organized. The harmonization of regulations governing correspondence education within the member states of the Council of Europe would improve each individual regulatory organization and protect them from infiltration from across borders by undesirable elements.

Some 204 volunteer literacy teachers were trained to teach in four pilot areas: Busega, Nansimo, Negezi, and Ihangiro. The focus of the project was to give cash crop farmers basic skills in reading, writing, and arithmetic, and experience in using these skills to solve their economic, social and cultural problems and to increase their participation in local, regional and national life. The period (May to October, 1969) was devoted to literacy classes; November, 1969 to April, 1970 (the period farmers were too busy) was used for agricultural demonstrations. Emphasis was placed on training and the role of teachers as leaders and professional workers. Some  of the conclusions reached are: the program as developed was inadequate; there should be no pressure to open a certain number of classes in certain number of places; Grade VII leavers would play a prominent part as literacy teachers; adequate measurement techniques of teacher performance should be developed; and the teacher's newsletter (Kufundisha Watu Wazima) should be continued.

Two groups of about 600 each were given multiple choice pretests based on programed materials. Alternatives were multiple choice programed texts, multiple choice marked format, essay format, and essay answered format. Performance and background data were obtained on all subjects. The multiple choice marked (MCM) format was chosen, and unprogramed portions of the material were programed accordingly. It was recommended that  the MCM format be used for subsequent editions of the self-study course, and that pictures and an attractive format be added. (The document includes pretests and posttests, guidelines for writing materials to be programed, descriptions of field test items, data codes, the experimental design, and 42 references.) (LY)",

It was concluded that small group methods can be effective for enhancing motivation for learning, developing positive attitudes toward later use of course materials, and improving problem solving skills. However, they were no more effective than lectures for transmitting information and concepts, although (when used in conjunction with lectures) the methods are helpful in increasing depth of understanding of the course content.

Low priority, weak centers of leadership, and a limited and confused mandate emerged as major obstacles to effectiveness. It was found that, on the basis of accepted cost benefit criteria, continuing education programs tend to cost relatively little and pay off rather well. Moreover, the potential market for basic education, high school equivalency, citizenship education, occupational training, staff training and career development for government personnel, and other forms of continuing education far exceeded current levels of activity. A policy declaration was suggested, followed by guidelines for  program planning and student recruitment, administrative and organizational changes (including creation of a new division), steps to strengthen the statewide continuing education system, a network of public relations officers, inservice and other training for state employees, and scholarships for continuing higher education.

Residential restrictions (if any), courses, institutes, and workshops on and off campus, staff training and development programs and activities, and responsibility for professional improvement programs were also investigated. Short term continuing education opportunities were plentiful in the region. All 13 states had some  program offerings, and there were opportunities to study in programs for regional, national, and international clientele.

The survey revealed great interest in a continuing education program, and some problems likely to be encountered. Two general kinds of expressed needs emerged: greater depth in basic professional skills, including training in skills not stressed in past professional curriculums; and desire for information on newly developing problem areas. Two subject areas (group process and management, administration and supervision) predominated. Other areas stressed were advanced practice in social casework, social work practice  with the disadvantaged, community organization and development, and special problems of adolescents. Classes, followed by conferences, attracted the most interest. Generally, professionals, supervisors, and executives urged classes for systematic coverage of major topics, and brief conferences for topics of current interest. There was also a demand for training of bachelor's level graduates performing social welfare tasks. No clear-cut views emerged on administrative details.

The prime purpose of this study was to describe the socioeconomic impact of the college on rural communities of New York State, particularly the New York State University College at Alfred (small village) and at Cortland (rural city, 19,181 pop.) and to predict institution-related inputs which were basic to this impact. The interaction and incidence of this input were studied relative to economic factors (purchases of food, clothing, furniture, amusement, and housing); to social factors (politics, local policy, and social ties); and enrollment and commutation of students. Some of the findings were: input for staff members varied with  town size in public colleges but was high in private colleges; the proportion of local students commuting varied with surrounding areas but dropped to zero at 35 miles; college purchasing dollars were diffused into the surrounding area particularly when a small town was near a large city; and the college has impact on the town; the town, on the region; and conversely regional development affects the town and the city.

During the three weeks of orientation, 97 students were introduced to the daily metropolitan newspaper which served as the stimulus material and were informed that in this non-traditional course they would be using office-type (IBM Executive Dictating) machines. During the fourth week, the rationale and objectives were explained. It was made clear that the degree of change in the students' speech would be limited to those deviations which actually constitute a handicap. All that is necessary to persuade a student to recognize and acknowledge that a problem exists is to have him recall  the number of times he was asked to repeat what he had said because his listener failed to understand him. (The instructor must first create a climate of respect for the student's culture, however, or this may invite disaster by making the student defensive.) The course work progressed from writing everything down before dictating, to deliberating before responding, to spontaneous response. As specific deviations were identified, special drills were designed for practice in standard pronunciation. Each student recorded at least twice weekly for auditing with the instructor. Evaluation of the tapes showed \"considerable progress.\" (AMM)",

        "description":"Chinese has been classified as an \"isolating\" language which expresses grammatical relation with few or no bound inflectional forms and many fixed syntactic constructions. The basis for this notion chiefly originated from the nature of Chinese monosyllabic structures and the relation of syntactic to morphological phenomena. Mandarin Chinese, however, does have bound grammatical morphemes, but their presence is less evident in the writing system than in connected speech. Chinese often uses various types of affixation as an important tool in morphological processes. The retroflexed suffix -r, described in this paper, is a characteristic feature of Mandarin Chinese and is one of the most important affixational devices in Mandarin morphological processes. It serves to indicate a  semantic change from the stem word and to change certain form classes into nominals, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Not only does it enrich the lexicon of the language, but it also colors connected speech more vividly. (Author/AMM)",

The two-year Asian language programs will be composed of a Pre-Speech Phase and an Active Phase, and will feature regular proficiency examinations. The lessons will be contextually based, experimentally relevant, and culturally informative. The personnel will consist of a professorial coordinator trained in aural-oral methodology and cross-cultural studies, and native master-drillers for the languages being taught.

A few contribute to the \"official\" character that English enjoys in our society or to the health and safety of the operation of certain institutions. These have continuing legal and political validity. (Discussed in detail are English literacy requirements in the light of state regulation, number of people affected, federal regulation, and early federal  practice; English literacy as a condition of voting; English literacy as a condition of business activity; English literacy in legal proceedings, English as the exclusive language of the American school system; and the special case of Puerto Rico.

The behaviorist trends applied to the audio-lingual habit theory were a major break-through for foreign language teaching, and skills ignored by the grammar-translation method were brought to the fore. Today, joint research in linguistics, sociology, and psychology has resulted in a much more complete and comprehensive statement as to the nature of language itself, the nature of learning a language, and the nature of language functioning within society.

        "description":"The author reviews some recent theories, experiments, and observations in psychology and psycholinguistics which challenge the basic assumptions of the audio-lingual method of foreign language teaching: Language learning is habit formation, requiring analogy rather than analysis; meaning can be learned only in the matrix of allusions to the culture in which the language is used; language should be heard and spoken before being read and written. The \"errorless habit formation\" of the audio-lingual approach is being replaced with the new theory of hypotheses construction. The importance of analysis is being realized, as is the necessity of personal and situational meaning in language materials. Every language has its set of sociolinguistic as well as linguistic rules, which are, by  themselves, a distinct means of communication. The study of bilingualism aids the analysis of the systematic nature of the functioning of sociolinguistic rules (which include alternation, sequencing, and co-occurrence rules). Teachers must instruct students in bilingual behavior and must establish a set of priorities and instruct according to these values. Sample intonation and word drills and grammar hypotheses, based on the vocabulary and structure in Lesson I of M.E. Gowland's \"Espanol Primer Curso,\" are appended. (AMM)",

        "description":"The author discusses the growing body of information in which can be found criteria for applying evaluation procedures to programs in TESOL (teaching English to speakers of other languages). One problem is that often educational goals are not stated explicitly or specifically; implicitly stated or implied goals are difficult to communicate to others or to analyze. Evaluation goals should be distinguished from the roles evaluation may play, which may be as part of (1) teaching training activity; (2) curriculum development; (3) field experiments in learning theories; (4) selection of materials; and (5) reward or punishment; e.g., in an executive training program. Evaluation may also have a role in on-going curriculum improvement raising such questions as \"Is the curriculum at this  point getting across the intended instructional objectives?\"\"Is it taking too large a proportion of the available time?\" Evaluation needs in TESOL are extremely varied, in terms of target population and objectives and the roles evaluation is asked to assume within situations. There is a need for people within the TESOL Association to become better informed in matters of evaluation. A Center of Evaluation of TESOL Programs should be established by the TESOL Association as a \"matter of urgency and self-interest.\" (AMM)",

        "description":"This paper discusses the interpretation of data on two types of phonological change: change in language over time in the culture, and change in the development of the individual speaker; and examines the position that these two sorts of change interact in a certain way in relation to phonological structure. If one conceives of phonology as a finite set of ordered rules which relate surface syntactic structure to the phonetic descriptions of a language, there are three obvious potential ways for it to change: a rule can be added or deleted, changed, or reordered. Assumed is that phonological rules present certain stable characteristics of the individual's perceptual-motor operations and provide the natural central units for the processing of language sounds. The changes present in\"phonological drift\" have been thought to represent the typical contribution of children during initial language acquisition; they are not found in adults, who are less able to reconstruct basic aspects of their phonological system. The typically adult form of sound change, rule addition or deletion, is not found in children, who are built so that they organize rather than add. Adults have much more greater control over the form of the language. The program of psycholinguistic investigation sketched here for phonology needs to be carried out for other parts of the grammar as well. (Author/AMM)",

        "description":"The situation in the U.S. is different from that in England, France and other European countries: in each of those countries there is something that is known as the standard language, and a number of dialects apart from the standard language. There is also a rather close consensus on what the standard dialect is (especially on phonological lines). The situation in the U.S. is more complicated regarding standard speech. Several regional varieties exist, and within these are social varieties. There are, in addition, groups of people who speak a variety of English heavily enlarded with some other language. The most critical problem is the Negro in the large city slums whose speech is marked by striking phonological differences. The individual speaker will have to choose whether he  wants to substitute the speech habits of the dominant culture for the habits of his own nonstandard dialect. The choice should be made available to him; he should not be made to live imprisoned with the nonstandard dialect all his life through lack of opportunity to move out of it into the standard dialect if he deems the move advantageous. More research, such as noted briefly here, is needed in analyzing white and Negro speech, before the standard dialect can be effectively taught. (Author/AMM)",

        "description":"Language arts teachers cannot handle the problems of the disadvantaged children of the ghetto because they cannot understand the language of the children well enough to evaluate the abilities of the children or create activities which would improve the quality of language experience for the child. It is possible to provide language arts teachers for ghetto schools with an academic experience which has immediate applications in the classroom. Thorough linguistic knowledge is the primary requisite for a sound language arts teacher-training program. Two courses would give minimum preparation in this area: one dealing with the nature of language and one on urban dialects. Standard English should be taught; the student must be given the language skills which will enable him to  alternate between the dialect of his peers, his home, his teachers, and his books. The language arts teacher in the ghetto school should (1) be familiar with ghetto culture; (2) study black English, but not necessarily as a means of communication with his students or the community; (3) learn about the family and community structures; (4) study the effects of poverty; and (5) study the peer group relations and different learning styles of ghetto children. A successful ghetto teacher must be resourceful, have magnetism, possess self-knowledge, and reflect love. (AMM)",

        "description":"An experimental program designed to develop oral language (English) was started in the San Antonio Independent School District in 1964 and included 28 first grade classrooms of culturally deprived urban Spanish-speaking children. Classrooms were designated as Oral-Aural English, with intensive English one hour daily; Oral-Aural Spanish, with intensive Spanish one hour daily; and Non Oral Aural (which was merged with O-AE and O-AS after two years. Ott's study, 1967, showed superior gains made by the experimental groups in the first grade, but these findings were not predictive of continued superiority through the intermediate grades. The author's study (her doctoral dissertation, University of Texas at Austin, January 1969, of which the present paper is an abstract) was designed  to analyze the cumulative effects of instruction on children receiving continuous treatment over a period of years. Conclusions remain unexplained as to why the scores of children receiving Spanish treatment excelled the other treatment groups when the criterion was English proficiency. A possible reason is that hearing one's own language amplifies the phonemic and syntactical contrasts between English and Spanish, thus making it easire for Spanish speakers to learn English. (AMM)",

It takes a teacher's full time just to keep up with the jargon. Many language teachers, particularly those trained in English as a second language, have come to have a certain faith in the audio-lingual technique in language teaching. That technique has been challenged; learning psychologists and psycholinguists have demonstrated that it is based upon a faulty hypothesis. Not only is the ESL teacher often accidentally assigned and inadequately prepared, but he  is expected to perform miracles. All these problems, which have not been solved by a national organization, cannot be solved by a local professional organization, but certain activities on the part of a local organization should help: a local newsletter, an annual bibliography of materials, a current listing of academic programs, and a listing of skilled professionals who can serve as consultants on a local level. Other activities that an affiliate organization can undertake to maintain or upgrade the professional status of ESL teachers are also pointed out. (Author/AMM)",

Four broad categories of bilingual programs are (1) Transitional Bilingualism, in which Spanish is used in the early grades to help pupils \"adjust to school\" and/or \"master subject matter\" until their skill in English is developed; (2) Monoliterate Bilingualism, which aims to develop both languages for aural-oral skills, but is not concerned with literacy skills in the mother tongue; (3) Partial Bilingualism, which seeks fluency and literacy in both languages, but generally restricts literacy in the mother tongue to subjects related to the ethnic group and its heritage; and (4) Full Bilingualism, which aims to develop all skills in both languages in all domains. (The  author feels that a fully balanced bilingual speech community may be a theoretical impossibility.) Vitally needed are (1) a survey establishing language and varieties employed by both parents and children, by societal domain of function; (2) a rough estimate of the relative performance level in each language, by societal domain; (3) an indication of community and school staff attitudes toward the existing languages and varieties and toward their present allocation to domains; and (4) an indication of community and school staff attitudes toward changing the existing language situation.

Plans for a followup study are discussed. The differences between the 1967 evaluative orientation report and the  1969 program are indicated by the fact that there were changes in virtually every phase of the program.

The first model involves the use of an optimum set of predictors and one equation derived from a regression analysis on first semester grade average in predicting the subsequent semester indices. In the second model, an optimum set of predictors and a new equation are derived for each semester average, individually. For the third model, each semester's optimum set and equation are determined individually, but prior semester averages are not included. In the first model predictive efficiency declines sharply from semester to semester. The second model predictions remained stable over the four semesters.  Statistical comparison between the second and third models shows that the inclusion of prior semester averages in the prediction battery strongly increased the predictive efficiency beyond that level attained for each sample's first semester average.

Testing of companions included: (1) the California Psychological Inventory; (2) Edwards' Personnel Schedule; and (3) the Mooney Problem Checklist.  A descriptive picture of the companions was utilized to see what kind of student would volunteer and to match companions and friends (those receiving help). \"The Good Friend Test\", an outgrowth of this program, and a short information form were the only responsibilities of the friends.

Major emphasis was devoted to measuring psychological factors such as self image, social relationships, attitudes toward school, and acceptance of responsibility for school achievement. Findings are discussed and a theoretical framework and goals for treating the problem are presented. The goals are viewed not as peculiar for underachievers, but as significant for education generally. The second paper concerns the school's investigation into the behavior of underachievers, its dissatisfaction with  previous rating scales, and its subsequent development and standardization of the Student Behavior Inventory which in its final form identified four significant factors: (1) aggression; (2) alienation; (3) anxiety; and (4) activity. The final paper redefines the role of the counselor in terms of the School's philosophy. The emphasis is on teacher-counselor cooperation in the creation of acceptance and openness in the school setting. (TL)",

The evaluation was drawn in the context of a community undergoing rapid social change, viz. the urban ghetto. The comprehensive community mental health approach was viewed as part of the white response to the increasing militancy of the minority people who inhabit the ghetto. Three interrelated questions are the focus of the analysis: (1) does the \"mental health\" effort serve to divert community resources from more meaningful efforts? (2) does the employment of neighborhood leaders in \"paraprofessional\" jobs serve to alienate these leaders from their community, thereby weakening the neighborhood power base? and (3) are federally funded programs free to confront  the basic oppressive institutions in our society? On all three counts the author concludes that community mental health serves a repressive function by diverting community energies from their primary task, their own freedom. The intropsychic approach in an oppressed community mystifies, pacifies, and continues the oppression of the individual. (TL)",

Having pointed up the shortcomings of the behavioral model, the author concludes that it is not strictly a behavioral model, but one which should be helpful in evaluating and revising current approaches to counselor education. The second paper specifies what the author considers to be the most important ingredients for successful workshops, institutes or short courses: (1) limited topic; (2) use of multiple media; and  (3) close, informal relationships with the participants. The final paper explores current difficulties in counseling research and focuses on the lack of definition of counseling and the acceptance of a too inclusive model which cannot even be utilized without years of prior research.

        "description":"Schoggen's description of environmental force units (EFU), actions or constraints upon a child, was the focus of this study. Since those EFU's under investigation conflicted with the child's immediate intentions and desires, they are referred to as conflict EFU's. The study asks how specific characteristics of preschool settings affect the natural occurrence of environmental constraints and children's adaptations to them. A Montessori class, a University Nursery School and two Head Start classes comprised the observed settings. The classification scheme devised by Wolfson and Jackson was used to describe conflictual situations. Fourteen modes of adaption are discussed. Several variables were studied and the findings are extensively presented. The author concludes that despite the  high occurrance of conflict EFU in the school environments studied, behavioral changes are effected gradually and temperately, which is in agreement with previous studies done by Fawls (1963) and Schoggen (1963).

        "description":"Previous research has found little or no relationship between student instructional ratings and numerous academic and personal variables. This study sought to determine if such ratings are related to student and instructor psychological types. Undergraduate engineering students (297) and nine instructors were administered the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator which is a personality classifier based on self-reporting. In addition, students responded to the Student Instructional Rating Report (SIRR) which provides a composite profile of five categories: (1) Instructor Involvement; (2) Student Interest; (3) Student-Instructor Interaction; (4) Course Demands; and (5) Course Organization. Various analyses of the data were described. They revealed no significant differences in student  instructional ratings among student types. There were, however, significant differences in student ratings among faculty types for three of the SIRR categories: (1) Instructor Involvement; (2) Student Interest; and (3) Student-Instructor Interaction. The paper concludes by emphasizing the potential influence of personal behavior variables among instructors in determining student reaction to classroom instruction. Implications are discussed.

These are: (1) empathy; (2) warmth; and (3) genuineness. All were considered validly measurable. A pilot training project, which focused only on empathy, is described. The results suggest a significant difference between pre- and post-scores in the levels of empathy for both an experimental and a control group. A followup project paired 66 college dorm counselors randomly to deal with specified problems common to their area and had them role play the different problems. They were grouped as follows: (1) those who received competent first-hand training focusing on empathy; (2) those who observed the training sessions via video tape;  and (3) those who went through a project which included case review and discussion. No significant differences were found between the groups in improvement in empathy, warmth, or genuineness. In other words, the findings did not corroborate those of the first study.

Undecided students at Brigham Young University were selected to attend College Orientation 96, a course designed to help them choose their major. Three experimental groups received educational-occupational information and/or self-analysis information under different conditions. A control group took the vocational course during the second half of the semester. All were tested at the beginning and end of the treatment period with: (1) a self-report instrument, indicating their level of development toward a college major choice; (2) Crite's Vocational Development Inventory  Attitude Scale; and (3) the Harren Q-Sort which placed students at one of four stages of development toward an occupational choice. Results and considerations for further research are extensively discussed.

No significant differences were found between the groups for theory grades or final grades. Each student had completed the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire, but the results indicated that the influence of group assignment on the practice grades did not vary with the students personality characteristics.

        "description":"The history of reform and the origins of unrest in America are briefly reviewed. Concurrent reform streams of the past are examined in terms of an emerging awareness of the relationship between racism and poverty and social environment. The mental health and social welfare movements paralleled this recognition, but did not lead the new reform. There were no fundamental changes in practice until the civil rights revolution shocked them into awareness. Recently, these groups have viewed poverty and racism as the major mental health problems. This paper emphasizes the need, in the light of history and research, for consciously directed social change. Environment, it is contended, must be altered. New frames of mental health practices now rest on the interdependence of psychological  and social matters. The paper concludes that reform has effected a new climate and, resultantly, some new institutional forms. It also questions whether the commitment to improve the quality of life and seek the objectives of social reform can be broadened into a national one. (TL)",

Admitting the varied pressures of modern society, he nevertheless believes it is the individual's fault when he fails to glean as much from lif e as he deserves, and it is his responsibility to do something about it. The rather innocuous events and happenings which gradually but surely erode our feelings of confidence and self-worth and make people the way they are, are considered: (1) the home; (2) churches; (3) schools; (4) marriage; (5) occupations; and (6) advertising. All are offenders against mental health and the sources of unfounded guilt feelings. The paper concludes with a brief  listing of what people can do about this major mental health problem. Suggestions include: (1) deciding that one has control over his behavior; (2) accepting oneself as less than perfect; (3) having fun; (4) developing a mutual confidential relationship with someone; and (5) setting realistic personal goals.

Specifically, three questions are discussed: (1) do counselors have a responsibility? (2) What have counselors done in education? and (3) how might the counselor and teacher make a contribution? In answer to the first, counselors do have an important responsibility and contribution to make in education in attempting to assist others to become members of a society which provides greater human nourishment. In answer to the second question, even though it appears that little has been done in preventive programs for mental health in education, results of experimental programs are  certainly encouraging. Prevention is the key concept when answering the third question. Safe, non-threatening relationships should be offered to students. Guided group experiences can be offered by the counselor. Curricular materials should be developed related to psychological health. Both counselors and teachers should be concerned about helping individuals in their total development. (Author/KJ)",

Four major aspects of the counselor's professional development and practice were covered in these studies: (1) his perceived role and function within public and private rehabilitation agencies; (2) a series of investigations based on a multivariate system model of the state agency counselor providing clients services; (3) a pilot study testing methods of relating counselor effectiveness to his university training; and (4) two sociological studies of rehabilitation counseling as a profession with emphasis on career patterns of graduate students in the field and movement of individuals into  the field as a second career. Comments by a qualified discussant follow each presentation. Also recorded are written and oral group reactions with respect to: (1) implications of each study for counselor practice; (2) implications of each study for counselor training; (3) suggestions for further research; and (4) other applications of the presented data.

Studies by Peterson and Brown, Harper, Brown and Pfister are included, each being concerned with the teaching requirement for counselors. The University of Minnesota's program is set up to prepare counselors who have no teaching experience. To date, five candidates have completed the program. Included in the program of two years of graduate study are a counseling theory course, practicum, and internship. The internship is spent in a public school setting with an in school supervisor who could give immediate feedback. Interns were encouraged to bring guidance into the classroom, and had to teach a four week unit on  identity. Evaluation at this time is difficult. All graduates from the programs have been offered second year contracts and superiors attest to the satisfactoriness of these counselors and their work. While many of the counselors have self doubts, they feel that they have a good working relationship with students and teachers. Tentative feelings about the program are that there is no need for previous teaching experience to be an effective counselor, provided the training offered is adequate.

A questionnaire on residential life was sent to 4000 resident students. The study includes four tables regarding 24 hour parietals by comparing: (1) male-female problems; (2) differences among classes; (3) sex and class year; and (4) hall and suite living.

These charts compare: (1) male-female responses; (2) class differences; (3) sex and class year responses; and (4) male and female hall, suite and coed living arrangements. Some results of the survey are: (1) female students experience more problems than male students with open visitation; (2) differences exist  among classes; (3) differences exist among female classes; (4) students in coed housing have more problems with hall arrangements than with suites; (5) more females than males feel parietals should be continued, and (6) more seniors oppose open visitation than any other class.

Accepting the fact that the problems of the political scene and gross underfunding were uncontrollable, focus was put on devising a service comparable to those utilized by middle class populations. A team comprised of professionals and unprofessionals was expected to share primary responsibility for a client and his family throughout their entire contact with the service. Varied, multiple and experimental treatment procedures were used. The approaches included: (1) a medication clinic; (2) a learning disability evaluation clinic; (3) activity groups for young latency-age boys and pre-adolescent girls; and (4) behavior modification  guidance to families.

These are described in terms of the persons they should serve. The remainder of the paper deals with the continuity in patient care which would ideally be the coordination of all mental health resources. It is defined as having the right kind of care at the right time. Two dimensions are considered: (1) the relations between organizations; and (2)  articulating roles within and between organizations. Sources of resistance to collaboration among services are mentioned. A sanction to mandate such collaboration must come from some community power center.

No single generalization is made, but the results include the students' reasons for entering college: (1) training for a vocation; (2) being better able to cope with life; (3) becoming more  educated; and (4) achieving success. Their expectations are also recorded: (1) anticipating change in the environment; (2) learning how to adjust to the change; (3) hoping for understanding professors; and (4) expecting to reduce their disorientation.

An analysis of 44 interviews, 22 of which led to premature termination on the part of the client, revealed an astoundingly different pattern of counselor responses to which the two groups were exposed. Clients who completed counseling were exposed to counselors who were active, empathetic, confronting, concrete, and positive. Counselors of the groups who terminated early were passive, detached, unempathetic, and negative. The over-all difference in response pattern for the two groups yielded a Mahalanobis D-square of 107.94 which was significant at the .001 level of  confidence. (Author)",

Personal characteristics of the women in a non-credit exploration course included: (1) average age of 40; (2) most were married and had children. The most significant change of interests before and after enrolling occurred with the group of women who, upon entering the course, were undecided as to their goals. The adult woman's academic achievement was noticeable above that of typically aged undergraduates. The counseling conducted with these women was reality-based. Several stages were readily apparent: (1)  readiness stage; (2) the exploration stage; (3) the action stage. The broader program at Ohio State University consists of more than described above. Basically, a pre-admission service is provided, supportive services for enrolled women is given, and counseling for typically aged students is available to inform them on changing life styles of women.

One successful approach has been the adoption of a social-psychological model of interview analysis which attempts to specify within-interview conditions which facilitate client behavior change. The criteria and procedure for developing such a system is briefly presented and the fidelity of the Hill Interaction Matrix to them elaborated. The paper attempts to provide four types of data about the Matrix: (1) that relative to its measurement characteristics; (2) the uses which have been made of it in individual counseling research, specifically the studies of Lee, Helervik, and Boyd; (3) problems involving its use, primary among which was the training of  raters and all of which concerned aspects of the rating system; and (4) suggested extensions of the current scoring procedures. The conclusion holds that the Hill Interaction Matrix fulfills the conditions necessary for instruments of its type better than any other scale currently available. (TL)",

With such a definition of paraprofessional roles necessarily comes a redefinition of  educator roles. The concerns and fears of both groups are aired.

A general hypothesis is proposed which states that the salience of an individual's concept of reciprocity in a particular situation is related to the cooperative and moral behavior of the individual in that situation. A certain type of cooperation game is proposed as a paradigm for investigating this hypothesis and for teaching the concept of reciprocity to children of late childhood ages. A major concern of the experimental studies will be to describe the development of cooperative and competitive abilities in late childhood, ages five to ten. A question of particular interest is whether or not children become more adept with  age at resolving conflicts of interesting situations where cooperation is required for goal attainment. Another important object of these studies will be to examine the effects of various prior game experiences upon subsequent interaction. A total of three experiments relevant to these issues are reported and two experiments are proposed in order to provide evidence for other hypotheses and to the matters discussed above. (Author/KJ)",

A multi-manipulation single organism design was employed with all subjects enabling both individual and group analysis. A study room equipped with an adjacent observation room enabled visual and audio monitoring of student study behavior. Academic materials were available to students in the study room exclusively and records of duration and distribution of student study time were made by an observer having a one-way mirror. Daily testing produced consistent rates of study behavior with low absenteeism from the study room, while intermittent testing produced sporatic bursts of study behavior and  frequent instances of absenteeism. Scalloping of study behavior rates occurred during the intermittent testing condition. Results suggest that daily testing supports more consistent study patterns than do intermittent testing programs. (Author)",

Apart from examining the relevant research literature, findings are presented which support the hypothesis that those non-disabled who have external control orientations are more threatened by physical disabilities (vis., internal disorder, cosmetic disorders, sensory disorders, and blindness). Evidence in support of the notion that internally controlled persons view emotional disorders as more debilitating than physical disabilities is also presented. Discussion is primarily restricted to three major disability categories: (1) social disadvantagement; (2) physical disability; and (3) emotional disorders. (Author)",

Sixteen kindergarten and 16 fourth grade subjects were trained to criterion on a Kendler-type task, whereupon each subject was presented a pair of new instances which contrasted only in the original cues of the original relevant dimension. Fourth graders selected significantly more positive than negative cue instances on the transfer task, indicating they had indeed abstracted attributes from instances. Kindergarteners, however, selected precisely half of either cue instance, indicating failure to abstract the criterial attribute. Results contradict an assumption common to concept-shift studies. Experiment II was  designed to show whether subjects attend to the dimensionality of a discriminated attribute in a concept-shift task. The subjects were 20 kindergarteners and 20 fourth graders assigned randomly by age group to an intra-dimensional or to an extra-dimensional shift, where dimensions were the same as in original learning, but all the cues were new. The subjects at both age levels performed significantly better on the intra-dimensional shift, supporting an attention-to-dimensionality hypothesis. Results were related to the concept-shift literature. (Author)",

The task involved the P-A recall of noun 4-tuples, for which the subject was instructed whether to learn four nouns as one unit or as three separate S-R pairs. Imagery was found to increase total recall, the number of 4-tuples from which nouns were recalled and the organization of recall, with imagery  subjects recalling approximately four times as many nouns as repetition subjects. Unitized-imagery instructions resulted in the highest organization of recall, and it is suggested that imagery is potentially a very effective memory organizer.

This report provides findings from an analysis of the frames of aspirational reference of 281 sophomores from an all-Negro high school located in a low income ward of Houston, Texas. Robert Merton's idea of \"frame of aspirational reference\" was operationalized to include indicators of goal level for occupation, income, education, and place of residence and an indicator of hierarchial goal importance. It was hypothesized that the male and female respondents would demonstrate similarly high level frames of aspirational reference. It was concluded from the findings that the boys and girls studied did maintain a  consistently high level frame of reference. In addition it was observed that very few of the respondents had low level aspirations and that boys and girls maintained identical hierarchies of goal importance. Pertaining to sex differences, it was observed that boys tended to hold slightly higher educational and income goals to demonstrate a higher level of consistency across goal levels in their frame of reference. Relevant implications were drawn. (Author)",

Nine of these eighteen subjects were assigned to the treatment group and nine to the wait-list control group on the basis of a free class hour at program time. Treatment consisted of seven disensitization and counseling sessions. The treatment and control groups did not differ significantly in initial Grade Point Average or scores on the A.C.T. Test. Both groups improved G.P.A. the program quarter. But only the treatment group  demonstrated a statistically higher improvement.

Jensen found that sentence construction as a mediator facilitated learning of paired associates, except when kindergarteners were used as subjects. The purpose of the present study is to determine whether the failure of the mediators to facilitate the performance of young children is due to the fact that they do not know what a \"sentence\" is, or because they are unable to \"mediate\" when mediators are provided. The influence of experiential factors in language development was measured by using children from two different social classes. Also studied is the ability to transfer mediation strategy. Subjects were 32 kindergarten boys randomly selected from a predominantly white  lower class urban school and a middle class white suburban school. The testing procedures are extensively described. Results gleaned from the study suggest that: (1) a mediation condition was more facilitating for middle class subjects; (2) lower class subjects exhibited a different strategy in approaching learning problems and were less proficient in generating sentences; and (3) providing mediators for young subjects does affect the learning of paired associates. Further study is suggested. (TL)",

This report examines one facet of those traditional services, inpatient specialty consultation, in the form of 100 consecutive initial requests for child psychiatry consultative assistance in the clinical setting of a large children's hospital. Analysis of the data in the usual categories (age, sex, race, fee, service, and diagnosis) would strongly suggest that the consultative process is highly complex and only partially, at best, responsive to the needs of patients. Clusters of other significant variables which alter the process include attitudes of the patient and his family, the consultant, the consulee and other staff members, hospital institutional practices, and community and social  influences. It would perhaps be more colorful to conclude that inpatient psychiatric consultation for children constitutes a symptom of the national non-system of health care delivery. Accuracy would require rather the conclusion that there is after all a kind of system, but that it is largely hidden, inefficient and too often hypocritical. (Author)",

Specifically, this study concerns the relationship between social class and the rate of processing of visual information in young children. Although various sources of slowness in learning are mentioned, this study focused only on basic cognitive processes, viz. the duration of time required by the child's perceptual system to process visual information. Subjects were 30 first graders from an advantaged (middle-upperclass) school and 30 first graders from a disadvantaged (lower class) school. A Berbrans two-field tachistoscope was used for estimating the processing rate. Techniques developed by Gilbert for controlling image persistence (based on the masking  effect of a second visual stimulus) were modified in order to make possible more precise measurement and control. The entire measurement procedure is fully elaborated. The study concludes that: (1) young children of low social class can be tested using the tachistoscope; (2) the four stimuli used (circle, star, square, and triangle) were appropriate for testing young children; and (3) children from a low socioeconomic background do exhibit slower processing rates.

By the end of the first semester, the consultant had supplemented his role by participations in discussions on curriculum and teaching methods, student-faculty communication and decision making, and decision-sharing with the administration. He then sent a  questionnaire out to teachers asking for their reactions to consultation. Several negative responses were noted. The second semester of consultation was spent working with administration and teachers involved in special projects. He also set up a one-day convocation to discuss problems of the school's population transition. In the third semester, the consultant will continue to provide assistance to the administration but will shift his focus to more long term consultative work in depth with selected groups of teachers.

Subjects were two matched groups, the first being 27 students who held work-study jobs for the entire semester and carried 12 semester hours. The control group was composed of 27 students who did not hold jobs during the first semester. Results showed that the first semester mean GPA of the work-study group was insignificantly higher than that of the control group. However, it is quite possible that some extraneous factors counterbalanced any detrimental effects of the job, such as more personal attention which could  instill a sense of responsibility for work-study students, and the need to develop better study habits. Further research is needed on the effects of attitudinal and motivational variables on the classroom performance of the working student. (KJ)",

There were nine criteria derived from three criterion devices which encompassed two problem solving simulations and a self assessment device. Conclusions were: (1) no one strategy proved optimal; (2) social reinforcement did have an effect upon some problem solving behaviors examined; (3) no training medium was found completely effective; (4)  audiotape and written booklet procedures were not significantly different in their effect; (5) the oral lecture was no more effective than the baseline control treatment; and (6) the measures may have lacked the necessary sensitivity to discriminate between problem solvers.

The second includes six behavioral divergent production abilities, concerned with the generation of behavioral ideas in quantity and variety. There were 22 tests designed to measure univocally those six DBX abilities. In order to determine the distinctness of these hypothesized abilities from behavioral cognition abilities on the one hand and from semantic divergent production abilities on the other, three of the former and four of the latter were represented by tests, plus the ability CMA, to represent  the verbal IQ. Analysis revealed that DBX abilities could be demonstrated as distinct from one another, from behavioral cognition abilities, from semantic production abilities, and from IQ. (Author/EK)",

At the end of the school year, each student in the project and an equal number of non-project students were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding the school's disciplinary system and the counseling effort. The project students were likely to feel inadequate in interpersonal relationships yet they were found to accept personal responsibility for school problems. Following counseling the typical project student was  likely to show better attitudes toward the school and discipline. Counseling was considered to be of more personal value by the student than the discipline. They appreciated, more than the control group, the help of a counselor. (KJ)",

In Study Three, an attempt was made to demonstrate LWA in another laboratory task, in which subjects were asked to make a series of choices among four different cards. Study Four attempted to demonstrate the generality of LWA through the use of a totally unstructured interview. It was concluded that LWA in laboratory verbal conditioning does take place under appropriate circumstances, when reinforcement appears to be a natural part of  the situation and the subject does not have a learning \"set\". It appears that this phenomenon can also occur in a naturalistic setting. The findings support a behavioral rather than a cognitive approach to an understanding of verbal conditioning. (Author/KJ)",

The social demand approach, useful only for reference purposes, attempts to forecast and assess consumer demand for education. Manpower forecasting tries to insure an output of the educational system to meet future economic demands, but provides mere approximations for medium-and shortrun goals. The cost-benefit approach, which will be most utilized in the future, attempts to insure either maximization of some objective function, or minimization of resources used to achieve a certain goal. Although sometimes inaccurate, ratios are essential to this approach. These three approaches will be used until replaced by more reliable tools, but in the final analysis the  decision-making function for educational resource allocation will remain political.

        "description":"In this era of rapid social change, educational administrators have discovered that new approaches to problem solving and decision making are needed. Systems analysis could afford a promising approach to administrative problems by providing a number of systematic techniques designed to sharpen administrative decision making, enhance efficiency, and increase the probability of educational program effectiveness. Several system models for rational decision making have been developed by business, military, and industrial organizations. Each of these models depends upon an operational definition of the desired result, a specification of the processes designed to achieve that result, and evaluative techniques to assess the success of each process. School districts and administrators  would benefit from the implementation of one or more of the rationalistic decision-making techniques such as planning-programing-budgeting system, critical path analysis, or operations analysis. Once goals are chosen, these techniques aid in proper resource allocation to effect those goals. (RA)",

Nine examples of decision-making situations are presented.

Cases include not only a priori decision-making schemes but evaluation schemes as well. A summary of the nine cases offers specific recommendations about methods that can be used for generating and processing the kind of \"data types\" required for educational decision  making.

The models presented are derived primarily from an indepth study of exemplary projects in 20 school districts, and are currently operational. The report includes models for the team conference system, two counseling programs in which school-based specialists serve all elementary school children in the district, a summer counseling program designed to assist in the transition from elementary school to junior high school, a program for prekindergarten children, several inservice training programs, and programs using auxiliary personnel and volunteers. It is suggested that effective pupil services must be part of a  coordinated program operated on a district-wide basis. Models and guides are provided for organizing, administering, and staffing a pupil services department in a structure that stresses the interprofessional approach. The close interrelationship between pupil services and instruction is stressed as is the necessity for involving all staff personnel--including principals and teachers--to ensure that pupil services are within the mainstream of the total educational program.

Composite scores for a control group comprised of a 3-year sample of 1,353 elementary and 3,726 secondary non-Title I pupils were also analyzed. Multiple regression analysis of the data--based on high, average, and low ability groupings of participants--failed to indicate the effectiveness of a gross achievement measure across grade level and time for Title I programs. However, the study distinguished  achievement for test and control groups as related especially to per pupil cost and achievement of specific objectives by grade level.

A longitudinal study of Texas public school students was undertaken to isolate factors that would predict academic achievement in high school. Three dimensions of antecedent behavior consistently appear as dimensions of successful intellectual activity: (1) convergent thinking, the ability to give a culturally appropriate response; (2) divergent thinking, the ability to devise new forms and ideas; and (3) symbol aptitude, the ability to recognize and manipulate  symbols. The appropriate model for the process of cultivating talented behavior is the dyadic interaction model, which treats the human person as a function of successive reciprocal stimulations between any two of the elements person, culture, and significant others. Extensive multiple regression analysis supports the contention that a small set of variables postulated to be basic dimensions of human behavior are successful in predicting high school academic achievement, and that these predictor variables retain stability across several samples.

These 54 children were assigned to one of the following groups: training, which participated in an individualized, structured perceptual motor program twice a week for 4 1/2 months; Hawthorne, which met with the trainer but played table games; and control. Achievement and intelligence tests were given. The hypothesized improvement in perceptual motor abilities did not manifest itself, although children under 10 years of age in the training group scored significantly higher on the PMS than did controls of like age. Nor did hypothesized improvement in intellectual performance, or achievement result. However, all  three groups improved significantly on PMS and achievement test scores; and training and Hawthorne groups showed significantly improved IQ scores. Thus, evidence suggested a correlation between perceptual motor ability and the variables of intelligence and achievement. (Author/JD)",

Results demonstrated that more emphasis was being placed upon the identification of children with hearing loss than upon the education and continued reevaluation of these children. Site visits confirmed the impression that there was a lack of understanding of the special educational needs of hard of hearing children. State departments were generally unable to affect identification or educational programs. Schools for the deaf were frequently required, by default, to accept hard of hearing children, but only infrequently made special  provisions for them. Clinics identified their chief function as providing identification and communication skills development services for preschool children. Recommendations were made involving educational, leadership, and research needs. (Author/JD)",

Mathematical learning of operations was equally facilitated by inductive and deductive modes of presentation. Both area and topical curriculum organization were equally effective, regardless of the mode of presentation used; however, exact repetition better facilitated learning at the  comprehension level when implemented by the inductive mode, while varied repetition was more effective when implemented deductively.

Results indicated that the centers as a group adequately informed their visitors about the demonstrated program, convinced them of the programs' merits, and caused a minority of visitors, who were already interested and willing to change, to try out something demonstrated. However, this trial was often of a limited nature, partly because the visitors saw their local situation as different from that of the demonstration school. Thus, the demonstration visit was seen as a small influence among other more powerful ones that existed in the visitor's situation, such as problems of cost, facilities, staff, and scheduling. As such it faded with time  but still had a desirable influence on a small number of visitors. (Author)",

        "description":"Various attempts have been made in the past to improve the quality of American education by individualizing instruction. The most common method of individualizing instruction has been by varying the rate of progress or the type of assignment. Perhaps a more important and little used method is that of adapting education to individual differences with respect to the goals of the educational program. An effective program for individualizing instruction must be based on extensive additional psychological research and development in (1) formulating the functions of an educational system, (2) achieving the individual's educational goals, (3) monitoring the individual's progress, (4) formulating goals and planning individual development, and (5) preparing the teacher for individualizing  education. Using the knowledge now available, a program known as Project PLAN (Program for Learning in Accordance with Needs) is being developed and tested. Project PLAN attempts not only to utilize knowledge about the learning process itself and about instructional materials, but also to help the individual student to know his strengths and weaknesses and, with the help of guidance and counseling, to select his educational objectives.

In order to compare the relative effectiveness of different methods of instruction, it is also useful to know something about the retention effects of various instructional treatments. Interpretation of the effect different teaching methods have on retention must be based, not merely on performance on the delayed posttest, but on the relationship of the performances on the immediate and the delayed posttests. An example of research involving four instructional treatments and two repeated measures (posttests) with no pretests is discussed as an application of repeated measures analysis to the study of retention.  The equations necessary for determining certain critical factors in the analysis are demonstrated. The location of significant differences, calculatio n of the slopes of retention curves, and tests for assumptions of homogeneity of variance are also illustrated. A reference list is appended.

The program was then administered during periods of four consecutive days to 450 freshman students who were randomly assigned to a group using one of 18 versions of the program. Criterion measures consisted of four daily unit tests, a post-program comprehensive test, and a delayed retention test; items in each test required either the reproduction of medical terms or the definition of medical terms. Findings from both daily and comprehensive tests showed that overt response was superior to covert response and that reading responses was definitely a function of the  reproduction accuracy required on criterion items, for reproduction of medical terms. Also, while variations in frame size resulted in no significant difference among the groups for these same two tests, the variation of number of responses required per frame produced a significant effect in favor of multiple responses when test items required medical term responses.

        "description":"Speech intelligibility was tested in three classroom type spaces, one of 700 square feet, and two of 200 square feet, using student listeners and recorded test material. One of the latter two classrooms was fully carpeted. The test material used was Modified Rhyme Test (MRT) tapes, presented via tape reproducer and loudspeaker. Also investigated were the expected signal attenuation over distance in these classroom spaces and the effect of added noise on speech perception. Based on statistical analysis of the results of the tests, the following conclusions were drawn: the MRT tapes are a valuable research tool in determining speech intelligibility using live observers; there are no differences between the test lists; at the same level of presentation, there is no difference in  speech intelligibility for female versus male speakers; and the signal attenuation in typical classroom spaces is a straight logarithmic function and approaches free field conditions in classrooms with large amounts of acoustical absorption on the floor and ceiling. From these results, a set of acoustic guidelines were drawn that can lead to significant improvement in speech perception in actual classrooms. (Author)",

A total of 144 college students were randomly assigned to a stress, or nonstress group, and to one of three response modes: constructed response with, and without reinforcement, or to a reading group. The learning materials consisted of a linear program dealing with the area of heart disease. The program contained material both familiar and unfamiliar to students. Posttests on both types of content were  administered immediately after the program, and the data were analyzed by multiple linear regression. A strong positive relationship between facilitating anxiety and achievement on the technical program was found. Facilitating anxiety also interacted with stress and response mode for technical material. Debilitating anxiety failed to interact with any of the variables for technical material, though an interaction with stress for familiar materials was found. (Author/SP)",

The game is constructed in modules that can be linked together in a variety of ways to achieve a different decision configuration for different class needs and a changing configuration over time to parallel the progression of the class. During the course of the project, a business environment was simulated with a mathematical model. The model was programed in FORTRAN IV, installed on a time sharing computer system, and documented for high school participants and a game administrator. The model was carefully tested prior to a full administration in a high school economics class. It was found that the model developed had the advantages of  stability, rationality, and controllability, although it was found to be too competitive in the marketplace allowing the results of teams' decisions to be extremely separated.

Various tables of statistical data show: (1) expenditures by the federal government in education, (2) expenditures by states and municipalities, (3) the portion of the 1960-67 Brazilian national budget projected for education and culture, (4) an index system of percentages of those expenses incurred during 1960-67, (5) a comparison of Brazil's expenditures for education with other countries,  (6) a breakdown of private vs. public contributions, (7) student enrollments in elementary, secondary, and higher education systems, and (8) per capita costs in each of these categories between 1960 and 1967. Conclusions drawn indicate that public costs climbed from 9.2% in 1960 to 11.9% in 1968 to an estimated 13.2% for 1970.

The establishment of uniform assessment procedures of foreign language levels, procedures for placement of college freshmen, and the development of standardized testing practices are viewed as goals of an articulated state-wide language program. Discussion of the Modern language Association and the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages testing programs stresses the ability to communicate in the target language. Specific criteria for testing programs focus on the establishment of levels; proposed areas of competence to be measured, definition of norms, and the application  of these results to articulation measures are examined.

Both sections investigate the selectivity in recruitment of the groups studied, including secondary school attendance, teaching roles, perspectives of occupational opportunities, and job preferences. Discussion of Form-4 pupils in 1961 focuses primarily on personal orientation to future education, jobs, and career aspects. This group of male African students is ultimately traced to their jobs and occupational status as of 1968. The aim of Part 2 is to help understand some of the little-recognized, central features of the early stages in the development of a nation's  teaching force. Analysis includes examination of teachers' attitudes toward, and perception of, their situation and job alternatives, and the relationships of those attitudes and perceptions to reading patterns and social origins. Frequent use of statistical tables is made throughout the study. For Volume 2 of the report see FL 001 835. (Author/RL)",

The mystery of determining the significance of percentile rank or \"norm\" tables to be used in the score interpretation of a particular test is dispelled in a discussion of how percentile ranks were developed.

The study assumes that current policies concerning student admissions, distribution of enrollments, and the form and structure of higher education will not change drastically in the near future. It examines in detail the University of California, the California State Colleges, and the public Junior Colleges and focuses on those measures which these systems alone, or in combination can take to accommodate increasing enrollments through more efficient use and development of existing facilities. Attention is directed to the following methods: (1) redirection of excess demand at one or more campuses or colleges within a segment  to other campuses or colleges of the same segment with available physical capacity; (2) increasing the planned annual growth of colleges or campuses which have not yet reached their planned maximum enrollment ceilings; and (3) increasing the number of students to be accommodated on a given campus or college by (a) increasing the projected size of the summer term; (b) extending the instructional program into evening hours and Saturday classes, and (c) adding additional facilities.

The Course Evaluation Program was a cooperative enterprise involving students, faculty, and administration. The questionnaires were processed by the Computer Center and analyzed by the Center for the Study of Higher Education. Results were obtained from 73 percent of the courses taught in the fall semester. Results indicated that a significantly larger percentage of students taking graduate courses reacted favorably to most items than did students taking courses at the undergraduate level.

This crisis will probably be met by (1) increased state allocations; (2) increased tuition; (3) deferment of student costs until he is out of school; (4) specialized federal assistance both to the institutions and the students. There is general agreement on the following points: (1) students will have to have more money to go  to college; (2) institutions are going to have to have more money; (3) it is in the national interest to maintain financially and educationally viable private colleges and universities; and (4) students should have as free a choice as possible with respect to their choice of college.

The proper credentials are those determined by Middle America, and those on the outside, the minorities, must accept these credentials and ways to obtain them before they are allowed \"in.\"\"Who should go to college?\" is a Middle America question, and because of political pressures Middle America is no longer prepared to tell anyone he should not try to go. The burden of proof has thus shifted from those trying to get in, to those who would keep them out. Being \"in\" is not the only issue; institutions of higher education are out of touch with the new knowledge and the new society of the young. Though, in the areas of law, medicine, architecture, and science, society is  used as a laboratory, the social science and humanities sectors, those subjects which bear most directly upon a person's search for himself in the context of his time, have ignored the world around them. This failure has led to much of the disruption on the streets and campuses. Colleges have become places where young people are being prepared for one version of life, while removing them from life during the preparation. It is essential that institutional forms be changed in order to move rapidly to a higher standard of excellence compatible with a society committed to a higher standard of civilization. (AF)",

PPBS has several advantages over conventional accounting systems, which still would be needed for day to day operations. First, it relates cost to output; second, it permits an analysis of the effects of changing existing programs or launching new programs by identifying marginal costs; and third, it allows institutions to develop plans and present requests for funding in a manner which justifies financial requests in terms of outputs rather than inputs. Some of the problems associated with PPBS are that (1) cost-benefit analysis is vital to PPBS and the benefits or quality of individual  programs remains a matter of subjective judgment; (2) educational institutions could fall into the trap of technocracy in which economic analysts control decisions by virtue of the cost data they are able or willing to supply; and (3) the cost of the operation may not be justified by the magnitude or kinds of decisions made on the basis of the new information. Though no panacea, PPBS can promote better management of the scarce available resources. (AF)",

One fear is that systems analysis will increase the need for centralized authority and highly structured activity, thus contributing to further alienation and dehumanization. A second objection pertains to the increased requirement for specifying objectives and subsequently measuring the performance and outputs. A corollary concern is that unintended effects of the educational process may go unnoticed by the rigid systems which is designed to handle only major factors. Another concern is that systems analysts will impose their values on the institution through their design of various managment systems. A major problem is the cost involved in the whole area of scientific management  applied to higher education. And finally, there is the danger of substituting technique for sound, wise planners. In order to make effective use of systems analysis, it is important that planners remember the interlocking relations of systems, that administrators be involved in developing the systems, and that administrators remember the primary function of institutions of higher education is learning and student development.

The question is whether the state (society) has a stake in educational policy which might rightfully exceed the collective desires and interests of the autonomous institutions. The creation of the State coordinating agencies does infringe upon the autonomy of existing institutions, but only insofar as these institutions have imposed upon or ignored the public interest, and in that case, state interference has been desirable. Examples are: (1) the creation of public colleges in States where private colleges have long prevented the establishment of such institutions; (2) the creation of junior or senior colleges in  States where the big State universities had preempted the choice locations with small branches that were expensive to attend; or (3) instituting diversity in States where the university system has tried to maintain its PhD granting monopoly. In other instances, State interference has prevented State or teachers colleges from emulating the State university, thus preserving diversity, and in some States, the State board's control over admission policies has insured more equal opportunity and less elitism. State interference has generally been limited to major policies, and has only rarely impaired specific institutional autonomy. (AF)",

Students have traditionally entered the university with the understanding that they have to take certain courses, and that their attendance at the institution depends on their academic performance as judged by the faculty. For ghetto students, this is practically a guarantee for failure. Under a really open admissions policy, the student should have the opportunity to have a series of experiences that he considers desirable for himself at that time, without requirements,  grades, or accreditation. When the student decides that he wants to prepare for a specific profession or degree, he can readily transfer to a credit program. The non-credit program could be staffed by the nonacademic personnel from the community. Learning to take responsibility for one's own learning is the central aspect of individual growth and this will be fostered by a policy which allows students to help determine what is relevant to their education. Such a policy will demand institutional reorganization into smaller units, such as cluster colleges. (AF)",

The law curriculum is attacked for being oriented toward subject matter likely to produce retainers, and not to the quality of life for the citizen and consumer. Law teachers are accused of assuming a \"hard nosed\" stance in their teaching, debunking whatever passions students bring to the subject matter. Law schools are urged to adopt new teaching methods, such as audio visual techniques, clinical experience and teaching machines. Others argue for the abolishment of the \"boring\" third year, and still others advocate abandoning the concept of the legal profession as a learned profession by developing relatively short, specialized training for specific legal tasks. All of these suggestions have many inherent  disadvantages and provide no real answers to the problems confronting society. Two more useful changes would be to (1) discard the ideology of the case method. A class needs not only the challenge of problems, but the example, from the teacher, of problems successfully solved. (2) Increase the role and importance of the subjects of jurisprudence and the legal profession in the curriculum. The crisis of confidence challenges the legitimacy of the existing legal order and must be met by legal education on its own terms. (AF)",

Graduate institutions are being attacked for not producing competent teachers, undergraduate institutions are criticized for lack of relevance. The traditional functions of the undergraduate school have been remedial, liberal and in some cases professional education. The functions of the graduate school have been to define the standards for competence in the various disciplines and professions, and to prepare people to practice these disciplines and professions. In the graduate school of arts and sciences there has been increasing emphasis on the Ph.D. degree. The procession from general to professional education is an unduly rigid concept. The whole sequence of higher  education and more particularly the relation between the college on the one hand and the graduate and professional school on the other should be reconsidered; graduate and professional training could begin in the junior or senior year. In the graduate school a new degree for persons interested in a teaching career should be created, so that the Ph.D. is for those interested in research, or teaching and research. Specialization between institutions in their degree programs would avoid making one of these degrees the less desirable one. (AF)",

The University of Wisconsin at Green Bay started operations in 1969 and is totally focussed on man and the environment, and on the concept of a communiversity. This means a socially responsible university relating to a socially responsible community. Its educational program differs in many ways from the traditional one. (1) There is true reciprocal relationship between the university and the surrounding community. (2) Teaching, research, and community outreach meld into a single  intellectual function. (3) The focus on ecology and communiversity requires extensive and frequent contact between faculty and students outside as well as inside the classroom. (4) The UWGB approach requires considerable student initiative in learning. (5) The university is organized along pan-disciplinary and ecological problem lines; disciplines and professions are secondary. Students select an environmental problem that forms the center of his intellectual interests and then chooses courses in the various disciplines that contribute to his thinking and understanding of that problem.

Of those schools that did not use the GSFLT, 11 indicated they planned to do so in the future, 22 did not, and 44 were undecided. Ninety-six of the  institutions had a graduate school-wide foreign language requirement for advanced level degrees, and 96 did not.

The Ph.D. degree as the sole legitimate degree for college teaching is outmoded, yet the evidence suggests that most of the state colleges are trying to pattern themselves after the great research universities, instead of developing programs more suitable to the teaching needs of the liberal arts and community colleges, where most of their graduate students teach. A new teaching degree, as an alternative to the Ph.D. is needed, not because there is a shortage of Ph.D.'s, but  because there is a surplus of inadequately trained college teachers. The Doctor of Arts should become the standard degree for college teaching. Some institutions have already established such programs. No institution should do so unless it is willing to accord the D.A. degree equal status with the Ph.D. For this reason many prestigious universities are reluctant to set up programs. The strongest of the state colleges and regional universities should offer the D.A. degree, which should be under the jurisdiction of the arts and science faculty, take three years, be interdisciplinary in nature, and teach the students something about teaching and higher education.

Part II proposes a strategy of cross-commitment to three developments: (1) a year of national service; (2) greater protection of teaching from research; and (3) new measures to advance equality of opportunity in higher education. Part III explores the relationship among: (1) selectivity; (2) standards; (3) balance between technical and liberal arts education; and (4) the organizational structure of colleges and universities. Specifically, the focus is on the conditions under which admission criteria can be changed to advance equality of opportunity with little loss  in quality of education.

Building on data provided during a previous study on success of transfer students after an initial semester of work, this study follows their performance during the next three and one-half years. Initially, the students are characterized in terms of sex, age, prior academic background and achievement, H.A.C.C. academic performance, and curricula pursued. Then, the colleges to which students transferred are described, and the curriculum they took compared to that taken at H.A.C.C. Next, student achievement and persistence at the transfer institution is reviewed. Some of the results and conclusions  are: 71 per cent of the students in the study earned baccalaureate degrees by the end of the fall 1969 semester; many students' initial quarter performance was affected by the transfer, but subsequently improved; and students at Pennsylvania state colleges, older students, students who ranked high in their high school classes, and women students earned proportionately more degrees than counterpart groups.

Students in seven English classes were randomly assigned to write on one of two topics at the beginning of the semester, and asked to write on the other topic at the end of the semester. Evaluation proceeded by mixing pre- and post-writing samples, and then distributing them for grading, in accordance with a 22-item rating sheet. Samples were identified by a student code number that did not indicate whether they were pre- or post-writing samples. The &quot;t&quot; ratio for related sample means was used to investigate any significant differences between mean scores, and  writing strengths and weaknesses for pre- and post-writing samples were compared. Also, 49 of the 87 students studied did not provide a post-writing sample because of withdrawal or other absence. Their writing strengths and weaknesses were compared with those who took both the pre- and post-tests. Finally, the students who did improve their scores were compared with those who did not. While the research procedures and scoring system indicate that the students as a group did not learn to write better, such factors as student absences, motivation, and measuring instrument validity will be further investigated through a replication of the study.

Identifying important factors such as means of financing, student needs, community interests, and commitment of local people to educational programs involving outsiders (some of whom are of different race or background), the study was begun in Clinton County, New York. Potential students, local community residents, and community leaders were the subjects of the survey and the major sources of data gathered by survey research techniques. Results indicated that the development of an experimental college program in Clinton County or in other upstate rural areas is a workable idea with  potential benefits both to the area in which it would be established, and to rural and urban students. However, the high per-student cost would require financial support from somewhere outside the rural area. Benefits to New York City students coming into this area have not been explored; however, a high degree of interest among Negro and Puerto Rican students was clearly demonstrated. The experimental concept received strong endorsement from them all. No large degree of prejudice in this rural, predominantly white area could be discovered by any of the instruments used in the study. (Author/JO)",

The work values--defined by Eyde (1962)--are expressed needs for: dominance-recognition, economic success, independence, interesting activity, mastery-achievement, and social status. Demographic variables linked with work values are marital status, age, educational attainment, current employment status, career pattern, socio-economic status, and field of work. Tabulations comparing work values with the demographic variables indicate that the central reason women work is for mastery-achievement, and that this reason is closely followed by social need fulfillment. Another  important work value, one closely associated with social opportunities, is the interest generated by the activity. The value of independence appears relatively moderate compared with the others. On the other hand, the two least important work values indicated were the achievement of dominance or recognition, and economic success. (JO)",

        "description":"This recent study investigates sabbatical leave policy for administrators in 80 California Junior Colleges. Except for a few newly-formed colleges or those having boards generally unfavorable to the idea, most of the colleges responding to the survey indicated some type of policy for granting such leaves. Justification for these leaves ranges from personal study, travel, or research, to the use of this time for mental and physical rehabilitation. The duration of leave varied from two months to a year, though most seem to favor two or three months. Compensation is based on a variety of criteria, including comparable teacher's salary, and administrative pay less a certain percentage. For a year's absence, a majority of colleges provide 50 per cent pay (although a few go as high as  75 per cent for a year), and full pay for a semester. Administrative hardships created by the individual's absence appear to be the major obstruction to granting sabbaticals. Presently, only six of the responding colleges that indicate a policy of providing leave for a quarter to a year's duration state that they have granted administrators leave under these policies. The trend, however, based on comments made, indicates an increase in the number of administrators to be granted sabbaticals in the next few years. (JO)",

This position paper sees the CIS technology as a way to extend and reinforce basic teacher-student relationships, and outlines the advantages to be gained through its use. It proposes a change in the current California State Education Code to permit needed development of these systems in the California junior colleges. Basically, the modification calls for a change in the Average Daily Attendance (ADA) apportionment for students enrolled in the CIS classes, an apportionment currently based on the total number of student contact hours  (hours during which students are under immediate supervision of a certificated teacher). The change would involve defining &quot;immediate supervision&quot; for CIS programs under the Code as student participation under the coordination and evaluation of certificated college instructors, and determining CIS contact hours directly from enrollment and credit earned. As proposed, these changes are intended not to increase state financial support, but to remove an impediment to more effective and efficient instructional systems.

The advantages found by students in the program include a new feeling of community involvement, a greater sense of relevance of the college experience to career goals, and a high degree of financial security  permitting regular college attendance. The two benefits most often cited by employers participating in the program are the opportunity to recruit young, college-trained employees, and the ability to get full-time coverage of work assignments.

        "description":"A learning model emphasizing objective-based instruction and learning style flexibility was tested in conjunction with a combined English 101-Social Science 101 course at Miami-Dade Junior College, Florida. During the spring 1970 semester, an experimental group of 34 students was provided weekly with objectives and the following five learning style options: lecture, small-group discussion, directed study, programed instruction, or community involvement. Objectives were presented behaviorally in the form of a study guide, specifically indicating the work required to obtain a particular letter grade (A, B, or C). The student could thus select both learning style and objectives to be pursued. Affective evidence gained from weekly attitudinal questionnaires, optional attendance  figures, and student-teacher communication indicated positive acceptance of the approach. Comparison of the experimental and control group performance at the end of the semester showed the following results: (1) experimental group students earned a C or better 20 per cent more frequently than the control group in the English classes; (2) experimental group students earned a C or better 10 per cent more frequently than the control group in the Social Science classes; and (3) on selected portions of the Educational Testing Service Cooperative English Test (Forms 1A and 1B), administered on a pre- and post-test basis, the experimental group did not gain as much as the control group.

Its objectives included determining if these peer counselors could influence the academic success and motivation of socio-economically disadvantaged students to complete the 2-year program, and if they might ultimately help recruit youths into the program. Short-term program evaluation was carried out by comparing scholarship and persistence statistics for three groups: (A) the socio-economically disadvantaged students who received counseling by the student advisors; (B) a comparison group of socio-economically disadvantaged students who failed to respond to the invitation to be counseled; and (C) a comparison group of fall 1967 entrants. Results after the first  semester of the program showed: (1) group A students persisted at a statistically significant higher rate (99 per cent) than did group B (81 per cent) and group C (88 per cent); (2) group A students performed at a higher academic level than group C students, and at an almost identical level with group B students (who had demonstrated a higher aptitude for college work on the entrance examination); and (3) 90 per cent of the group A students rated the program as good or excellent, as did 100 per cent of the student counselors. Results after the second semester revealed that subsequent persistence and academic performance effects are not as apparent after the first semester.

        "description":"Recent attempts by the Federal Government, industry, and community groups to concern themselves with school accountability suggest that unless the educational community begins to develop effective and meaningful evaluative criteria, external agencies may do it for them. This paper describes the current status of the evaluation of teaching effectiveness, and suggests guidelines for developing a more comprehensive evaluative program. To begin with, a criterion-referenced approach to evaluation is suggested, with greater emphasis placed on the product rather than on the process of teaching. On this basis, changes in learner behavior are seen as the ultimate or most important measurement criterion. After discussing recent efforts to establish effective evaluation schemes and the  obstacles which these schemes must overcome, an approach to the problem is outlined. This approach calls for a commitment by faculty and administrators to develop behavioral measures of the individual instructor's and school's effectiveness; the development of applicable pre- and post-test measures of effectiveness; program implementation; behavioral definition of skills necessary for success in various occupations and professions; and finally, the combination of course, curricular, and institutional objectives into a general set of goals for which both instructor and administrator can be held accountable. A brief description of efforts at John Tyler Community College (Virginia) toward these goals concludes the discussion. (JO)",

Freshmen entering business administration, electrical technology, nursing, and secretarial science curricula at the two schools were surveyed during their orientation week and 18 months later. Findings indicate that entering freshmen had: (1) similar demographic characteristics; (2) much the same expectations for environmental press; (3) highly similar personality profiles; and (4) similar levels of dogmatism. Demographic characteristics of freshmen who subsequently dropped out did not differ significantly from those who continued;  however, institutional environmental press did differ, with support of intellectual pursuits and adult treatment of students being greater in the junior college. Based on the above, there was no clear indication that either type of institution was more effective for a specific type of student. In addition, while students had a choice between two different intellectual but similar non-intellectual climates, selective sorting based on personality-need profiles did not occur in terms of attraction to one institution or the other.

The report of the working party contains: (1) discussion, (2) conclusions and (3) plans and perspectives. The present use of computers for documentation and information is discussed and it is noted that, in education, no international (world-wide) or regional (European) system exists but rather only isolated national projects. The development of international systems in other fields has demonstrated the possibility of applying computer techniques to  multi-national and multi-lingual documentation and information. Some of these international systems are described briefly as examples. The working party proposes a short-term plan (to 1975), a medium-term plan and long-term perspectives. The rapid advance of communications technology and the growing interdependence of research and development in all fields imply the possibility of a merger of documentation and information systems covering specific fields into an all-embracing system for the transfer of data, voice and images.

In spite of an experimental situation that was something of an ordeal, some meaningful data was generated. The main area investigated in this study was the evoked-response indices of temporal processing, that is, the recordable response of visual cortex to single flashes and pairs of flashes. The flash pairs were presented with varying inter-flash intervals. Stimuli consisted of pulses of light provided by a Grass PS-2 photostimulator. Dependent measures of subject responding were derived from monopolar recordings that were taken from the right occipital region centered between midline and ear. Computer memory was fed to a Mosley X-Y plotter, which  provided permanent ink records of the data. Several findings are reported but the main conclusions concern relations between children and adults regarding the visual evoked response: (1) the time required between successive stimuli for the emergence of coherent cortical responses is longer in children than in adults and (2) backward masking or inter-stimulus interference is much more pronounced in children.

The subjects were a group of 600 children drawn from first through fifth grade. They were placed in a situation in which they could give recently-won money to the March of Dimes. While in this situation, the children observed the model giving them advice (to give, not to give, or neutral) and responding to the situation himself (giving or not giving). Every possible combination of preaching and practicing was used, so that there were altruistic models, greedy models, and inconsistent models. Data was collected concerning (1) the subjects' giving behavior, (2) the  subjects' ratings of the model, and (3) the subjects' advice to other children. The results revealed that behavioral example affected the children's behavior but not their advice to other children, while the model's exhortations affected the children's advice but not their behavior. Both the model's behavior and his exhortations affected the children's judgment of him, but the relationship between the variables appears to be additive. (MH)",

A Parent Awareness Program was developed for use with two groups of Head Start mothers over a 27-week and a 17-week period, respectively. Specific objectives were that mothers would (1) become more aware of the needs and feelings of others, (2) develop a greater awareness of themselves, including an understanding of their strengths, assets, and the effect of their behavior on others, and (3) learn explicit techniques to improve communication skills that would in turn result in better interpersonal relationships. Two Parent Educators took the role of facilitators for the informal group discussions in helping the mothers try  out new ways of handling problems and of expressing themselves in the group session. Focuses of the discussions included parent-child relationships; methods of discipline; communication skills; self-knowledge; marital status; heterosexual relationships; drug, alcohol, and glue-sniffing addiction; and racial feelings. When appropriate, the Parent Educators introduced audio-visual media, handouts, and role-playing exercises to expand discussion. The sustained level of participation and the favorable reactions to the program reported by the parents and staff indicated that a parent awareness program is feasible for this population.

The work of these two researchers leads to the conclusion that differences between graphic expressions of children of the same age reflect differences in the children's mode of information processing. Specifically, this study sought to test the following hypotheses: (1) the subjects' cognitive style, as measured by the Conceptual Style Test (CST), and his mode of perceiving as measured by the Children's Embedded Figures Test (CEFT), will correlate significantly with specific criteria of his graphic expressions, and (2) analytical scores on the CST, CEFT, and graphic expressions (Drawings I, II, and III and Sophistication of Body Concept) will increase as subjects advance in grade.  Affirmation of the second hypothesis would indicate a developmental trend from a global (field-dependent) mode of information processing to an analytical (field-independent) mode. The tests were administered to 114 boys, two of each grade level, from grades 2 through 6. The results, obtained from testing of sub-hypotheses, indicate general support for the second hypothesis and partial support for the first. The specific data are discussed in relation to conceptual style, perceptual mode, and graphic expression. Specific recommendations for further study of cognitive styles are made. (Author/MH)",

        "description":"This paper suggests that the main reason for the failure of many children to learn to read may be that reading programs often require the child to begin reading before he has developed oral language skills. By 3 years of age the child has acquired almost all the linguistic rules needed to produce basic, or kernel, sentences, which consist of subject, auxiliary, and predicate. Language programs for young children should work with the two major aspects of linguistic activity: competence (internalized knowledge, or rules of grammar), and performance (the use the child makes of that knowledge when speaking.) Transformational grammar may be used as a tool to expand the child's language; this is discussed in terms of Jacobs' (1968) writing on deep structure and surface structure. A  first principle of language teachers is to listen to and respect the language the deprived child brings with him to the classroom, then extend his ability to communicate by addition of a new social dialect. Teachers must know how to assess the child's linguistic skills, identifying areas of competence and performance, so that individualized instruction may be planned. Classes should stress student involvement and utilization of the child's own sentence patterns, as a means for the teacher to direct the child's own discovery of transformations of more complex speech patterns.

        "description":"The principles of the Montessori theory of inner discipline are discussed and evaluated through examination of the writings of and about Maria Montessori. The principles are also discussed in relation to available empirical and descriptive research concerning discipline. The principles of inner discipline may be summarized as follows: The child is a man deserving of respect. He has an inner power which forces his expansion, and his will leads him to develop his abilities. The teacher acts as a loving observer of the child, who does not impart what is hers but rather develops that which is within the child. The teacher prepares the environment in which concentration can be begun and carried out, and in which obedience can be cultivated through the gentle training of the will. Once  the child has begun to concentrate, the teacher does not interrupt him. Discipline is an on-going process dependent on personal freedom. It is brought about through an inner force developed in the child by spontaneous interest in and concentration on an external object (work). The child thus learns to move about actively and purposefully rather than wildly or apathetically. He finds his satisfaction in the need to produce and perfect his own work; this is his inherent and only reward, a reward which eliminates the need for punishment. (Author/NH)",

It was further hypothesized that children who learned to follow instructions involving a new rule would be superior at discovering this rule in a concept identification or inductive learning problem. Sixty Head Start 4-year-olds who could follow directions but did not know the components to be taught were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups: (1) learned the new rule, (2) learned new attributes, (3) learned both rule and attributes, and (4) control. Results of pre- and  post-tests on concept utilization and concept identification indicated that the experimental groups performed better than the control group if and only if the children had learned both components before or during the experiment.

The John F. Kennedy Child Development Center has a plan to avoid moving professionals to observe a child or to having a child's family move to an interdisciplinary evaluation center. The plan is based on the use of videotape recording (VTR) in the child's own home situation. It causes little inconvenience to the family, is more unobtrusive than a group of observers, and makes it possible for a team of specialists miles away to observe directly the dynamics of the family and the behavior of the child. These standard samples of a child's behavioral repertoire  can accompany regular written protocols and can record the administration of developmental tests. Evaluation and diagnostic sessions can involve the professionals at the center, the VTR, and professionals in the child's locale, who can participate by means of a long-distance amplified telephone. The training impact of a university-affiliated center's operation would therefore be extended. (MH)",

It is suggested that on the basis of research findings, the rationale and techniques for constructing a curriculum based on the development of an  individualized instruction program are quite appropriate for the design of an IES curriculum arranged according to a series of developmental levels. It is specifically recommended that the infant's environment be carefully and scientifically structured through the use of autotelic stimulation.

The evidence indicates that verbal comprehension relates highly to intelligence test scores, to reading achievement, and to academic and occupational success, suggesting that education should begin during or before the period of early, rapid language development. However, because environmental stimulation during later years profoundly influences intellectual functioning, education must be a continuing process. In fact, data indicates that IQ scores increase during intensive intellectual stimulation and  decrease when such stimulation is terminated. There is, therefore, a need for family-centered programs designed to increase the educational quality of family interaction throughout the period of child development. Parent training programs have been successful in improving parental behavior. Parents should be recognized as the most influential educators of their own children and provided with teaching skills.

In the first exploratory study of the series, two stimulus patterns were placed over the cribs of 15 infants for the infants to look at and be familiar with. One pattern was stationary and one moved. Following 4 to 5 weeks of exposure, each baby's preference for one of the patterns was assessed. Next, each of the familiar patterns was presented simultaneously with an unfamiliar one and then  reversed, and a record of the direction of the infant's gaze was kept. Results favored the hypothesis of attentional preference for the familiar pattern. The general strategy used in this study is to be further refined in the author's subsequent studies. (DR)",

The implications of a medical model include assessment of both intended and possible outcomes, and frequent monitoring of participants' feelings and  program processes. An example of such research is the Head Start longitudinal study of disadvantaged children being carried on by Educational Testing Service. Included is a description of some of the problems encountered in this project. (MH)",

        "description":"There is a clear need in our country today for early education programs aimed at accelerating the cognitive development of disadvantaged children. Another need is for centers to care for the children of working mothers. Our traditional nursery schools have deemphasized early cognitive development while day care programs have been focused on deprived children and inadequate parents. There are some marginally successful compensatory preschool programs under Head Start impetus, but these programs have little in common with conventional preschool education. The popular conceptions of preschool education and day care have little to do with meeting the child's cognitive needs or his mother's need for self-esteem. What we need today is a new program design that combines temporal  flexibility with known effective child care and educational practices. It is recommended that these new blends of early education and child care be developed to avoid identification with indigence and maternal ineptness. Those programs should provide incentives for mothers to become involved so that through training, they achieve self determination. It is further recommended that researchers be funded to continue to search for the most effective techniques of early education. (MH)",

        "description":"The current interest in an educational technology that stresses adaptation to individual student differences has resulted in such individualized systems as Individually Prescribed Instruction (IPI) and Computer Assisted Instruction (CAI). However, such systems are not the answer to an avoidance of standardization of students. No one has yet resolved the basic dilemma between the cost in time-and-effort efficiency and the demands of test theory for validity and reliability of tests. This dilemma means that while good teaching items should have a low error factor in order to elicit the correct response and then reinforce it, good diagnostic items (needed for individualization) should not have a low error factor. Thus, good teaching items meet criteria incompatible with those met by  good diagnostic items. This problem is not insurmountable, but none of the existing programs of individualized instruction have solved it. The most persuasive point against the existing programs is that they are individualized only in terms of what the student brings to the lesson; they still result in the production of uniformity.

The emphasis of the curriculum is on the development of information processing skills, rather than on the learning of specific information. The curriculum is implemented in the form of a sequentially programmed, structured instructional program. The skill development objectives follow the basic stages in the processing of information and are categorized under either Sensory skills, Abstracting and Mediating skills, or Response skills. Sensory skills include all the processes of successful input and decoding of environmental stimuli, involving the orienting skill, the discriminatory skill, the relational skill, and the sequential skill. The DARCEE curriculum also develops the  Abstracting and Mediating skills. These skills comprise the Organization process, the areas of which have been designated as Basic Concept Development Association, Classification Sequencing, and Critical Thinking. The Response or Output skills concentrated on by the DARCEE curriculum are those of fine eye-hand coordination and verbalization. The content of the curriculum is ordered into interrelated units whose themes were chosen because they would be of interest to children. The need for a change in attitudes and curricula in our public school systems is stressed. (MH)",

In this study, one of the interviewer's assistants wrote a detailed description of five minutes of the child's behavior while another assistant took Polaroid pictures of the child at the same time. In the afternoon, the interviewer took each child aside and asked him to describe what he was doing in the pictures. The children spoke freely and easily with the interviewer about the pictures and their own activity.  Data collected in this manner and from other techniques were used to compare the Follow-Through classrooms of Teacher A (child-directed individualized learning) and Teacher B (teacher-directed group instruction). The children in Teacher A's class valued \"other activities\" (block play, water play, listening to records) more than \"doing what the teacher likes\" and \"doing\" traditional academic tasks, while Teacher B's students did not. Also, the language used by Teacher A's students was more differentiated and varied than that used by the other class. (MH)",

Through this process, a  verbal causal reasoning factor, including the 5 component subskills of chance, skepticism, perspectives, completing &quot;because&quot; statements, and detecting incongruous causal relations, was identified. Other results fail to support both Piaget's theory that preoperational thought leads to precausal explanations and Piaget and Inhelder's theory of the unitary nature of logical thinking.

Normal children seem to acquire their native language by this process, rather than by eliminating specific mistakes. Preschool language develops in stages, and knowledge of where syntactic change is likely to occur should be used in planning and evaluation of early education programs. It is useful to know why certain syntactic constructions are to open to change in the preschool years. For example, three processes are involved in the production of elaborated noun phrases. They are (1) surface syntactic structure, (2) deep structure, and (3) syntactic transformations. These aspects of processing language can be facilitated by  instruction in perceptual-motor skills, by use of referential cues in the language situation, and by role playing with serious communicational intent. Current language curricula combine these aspects in unsystematic ways, so that it is not clear what processes have been affected when a change takes place in a child's grammatical construction. Ultimately, language programs should be directed to the individual's specific language needs. Cognitive facilitation is not necessarily to be expected but is dependent upon the particular features included in each program. (NH)",

Controlled test situations should be established in which the child receives minimal cues from the situation itself. Children should clearly understand the meanings of the words used, and test items should be constructed so correct answers cannot be given unless the child comprehends the syntax being tested. The child is verbally instructed on what to do with toy test materials such as boy and girl dolls, blocks, toy animals, marbles, sticks, and clay. Problems are set up in terms of levels of difficulty. First level items include  testing children's understanding of active sentences singular/plural nouns, and possessive noun inflection. Second level items include negative/affirmative statements, and questions, singular/plural with noun and verb inflections, and adjectival modification. Third level problems test for understanding of negative affix, reflexivization, comparatives, passives, and self-embedded sentences.

Language training stimulated infants to imitate actions and sounds, identify and name objects, verbalize needs, use picture books, develop elaborative language,  and use internal dialogue. Concept training stimulated infants to understand concepts of body image, space, number, time, and classification. On initial testing both groups of infants were average in intelligence and motoric development, but below their chronological age in language and concept development, and in interpretation of symbolic representation. Posttests showed that the experimental group had consistently higher scores on IQ, language, and conceptual development tests. There were no significant differences in sensory-motor development.

It is noted that the majority of Asian countries had a high incidence of dropouts during the first three to four grades. It is also noted that most countries reported more incidence of dropouts in rural areas than in urban areas and that more dropouts were attributable to girls than to boys. The report lists factors which are contributory to the high rate of dropout and retardation, and 14 suggested remedial measures to minimize the wastage are  listed.

The techniques used for gathering data on the 544 seniors (330 white and 214 black) in 20 high schools were questionnaires and group interviews. It was found that the majority of the male seniors, both black and white, planned to enter professional, semi-skilled, or skilled occupations, while 4 out of 10 of the females, both black and white, planned for a professional occupation. Seven out of 10 of all males planned to  continue their education, while more black females than white planned on additional education after high school. All male respondents' plans for residence were similar, while more black females than white females planned on urban living. Black males wanted to marry younger, but all male respondents wanted from 2 to 4 children. The white female expected to marry younger than the black female and desired 5 or more children as opposed to only 2 children expected by the black female. (LS)",

The purpose was to determine if the migrant child is adequately cared for when he enters the urban area and if the educational institutions adequately provide for him. It was believed that the study would also give a picture of the approximate number of migrant children entering other urban areas of New York State. Interviews were conducted among approximately 433 migrant families. Teachers of the migrant children were also interviewed, and contacts were made with local agencies that provided aid to families. General findings are reported in terms of demographic data,  and the migrant child's school grades (reading and mathematics), behavior, and attendance.

These tempos are determined by measuring latency time (time lapse) from stimulus to first response and recording the number of errors made. In this 1968 study, 6 null hypotheses were tested using 18 migrant children aged from 4.5 to 14.2 years. Purpose of the study was to determine what effect, if any, the A Blocks treatment (a sub-unit of the Attribute Games and Problems unit) has on conceptual tempo. Of more specific interest was the effect of treatment upon enhancing reflectivity through modification of an impulsive tempo in migrant children. Control and treatment groups were set  up wherein the examiner-teacher was permitted to guide the treatment group through a part of the A Blocks test; however, control group students had no directed activity but were allowed to converse with the examiner during the activity. It appears that if one's goal is to increase latency time between stimulus and initial response, the method used with the control group generates the most positive trend. The general conclusion was that the A Blocks portion of the Attribute Games and Problems unit does not enhance reflectivity of migrant children as measured by latency time and number of errors.

A century later, higher education became available. In 1905, legislation was enacted that served as a milestone of progress for the growth of education. Separation from Denmark, which was leading Greenland in its programs, was a problem, particularly with respect to language differences. Reforms instigated in 1950 were designed to link the 2 countries more closely, and efforts were made to overcome the difficulties of having 2 languages. Problems today include population increase, a lack of Greenlandic-speaking teachers and tutors, and a lack of suitable textbooks. Also of major concern are administration of the growing educational  system, curriculum design, vocational training needs, and an increased demand for higher education. Much progress can be cited, but there is much yet to be done. [Not available in hard copy due to marginal legibility of original document.] (BD)",

In keeping with this, the present study hypothesized that degree of identification with Mexican American subculture is inversely related to desire for upward intergenerational mobility. Ethnic identification was indicated by an index of the use of Spanish in a variety of situations, and aspiration for intergenerational mobility was measured through cross-classification of the respondent's long-run occupational aspirations with job of main breadwinner in his family. Comparative analysis of &quot;upwardly  mobile&quot; and &quot;nonmobile&quot; respondents (by ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and sex) as well as comparison of ethnicity scores (by degree of mobility projected for each socioeconomic type by sex) did not support the hypothesis. A concluding discussion is presented of a number of alternatives and their theoretical implications as to whether language usage and occupational achievement could be possible indicators of Mexican American ethnicity.

The first of the 3 sections of the book deals with those behavioral goals of particular significance for teachers working with nursery, kindergarten, and beginning first-grade children. The second section emphasizes desirable goals to be attained during initial reading instruction for the first through third grades. A third section concentrates on those language behaviors desirable for effective performance from the fourth through sixth grades. Each listing of goals is accompanied by a group of suggested ways of working toward these goals. A color-coordinated section is included which contains games and activities to facilitate  meeting the needs of a child's particular problem. The last section also includes a list of some sounds and language patterns which are difficult for the migrant child for whom English is a second language. (AN)",

The objectives of both extension divisions include providing opportunities for migrant women and youths to learn by doing projects which help them improve their self-confidence, leadership abilities, and home and family living. A summer program set up to carry out these objectives was designed. Youths were offered a 6-week program in food, clothing, arts and crafts, recreation, and conservation, while adults took part in an 8-week session on grooming, foods and nutrition, storage techniques, and clothing construction. Volunteer workers helped fill staff needs, along with 2 extension  home economists and the director of Migrant Family Clinic. The program effort was reported to be extremely successful, and it was suggested that a continual effort to cross cultural, racial, economic, and geographic lines would hasten better understanding between migrants and the community.

The illustrative  case suggests the type of content necessary, and the case commentary serves to assist the planner in making the presentation of his plan qualitatively and quantitatively better. The illustrative case in this volume has as its general objectives the improvement of reading skills of elementary school children, the training of teachers to improve teaching of reading, and the provision of an exemplary plan for improving reading in a rural isolated setting. A list of language materials and a bibliography are appended. (LS)",

The decade of the 1960's is noted to be the significant period in bringing to the attention of educators and the American public the educational problems facing the Indian American. Some of the factors reported to be the underlying causes for the educational retardation of the Indian children include (1) the Federal Government's policy of coercive assimilation which has resulted in disorganization of the Indian communities, (2) a lack of self-fulfillment of Indian students at every age level, (3) the negative self-images of the Indian students, and (4) a lack of understanding of cultural differences on the part of many schools.  The study cites the efforts of some schools to combat this problem through implementation of programs that are bicultural and bilingual in nature.

In this experiment 10 subjects from upper-division education courses, all volunteers, received various types of preliminary training with letter stimuli; then all subjects learned a word reading task and a sentence reading task. The letters, words, and sentences were graphically, as well as aurally, meaningless. The results of this experiment indicated that transfer phenomena in stimulus-compound paradigms were generally consistent with phenomena in more conventional paridigms. This implies, says the author, that a generalized theory of transfer of associative learning is feasible and that this theory could be  instrumental in the development of more efficient methods of reading instruction.

This material is supplemented by special worksheets and record-like discs which are prepared by the research and development center at the University of Pittsburgh. Stage one emphasizes reading readiness and prereading activities. The objective  of the decoding stage is to have children translate printed symbols into meaningful sounds.

Of the studies reviewed, 12 investigations supported the hypothesis that perceptual-motor development programs enhance reading achievement. The reviewer concluded that the effectiveness of perceptual-motor development programs in improving reading ability can neither be confirmed nor denied. In general, perceptual-motor programs employing a wide variety of experiences appear to show promise with underachieving intermediate-grade students and  preschool children. The effectiveness of Delacato- and Frostig-type programs is doubtful. The inclusion of individualized perceptual-motor programs for kindergarten and primary-grade children in physical education classes is developmentally appropriate.

It was also found that reading comprehension had a higher correlation with listening than with IQ, mental age, or sex. Students with IQ's above 110 had slight differences between listening and reading; those with IQ's below 110 were far superior in listening.

The predictor variables for total group first-grade achievement found to be significant at or above the .05 level were sex, mother's education, teachers' predictions, reading percentile, the Numbers and Matching subtests of the Metropolitan Readiness Tests, the Visual 3 subtest of the Gesell Developmental Tests, Complete-a-Man, and the Digit Span subtest of the  Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC). For second-grade total group achievement, the predictor variables were teachers' predictions, socioeconomic status, reading raw score, teachers' see peer rating, and the Information subtest of the Metropolitan. Predictor variables for sex and for socioeconomic levels also are reported. Results of the WISC indicated that the Full Scale, Verbal, and Performance IQ scores were not significant predictors of reading success. Tables are included. (CM)",

The ratio of boys to girls was approximately 7 to 1, the mean age was about 10.5 years, and the mean IQ was about 98. The Metropolitan Reading Test (Upper Primary) and a diagnostic battery of informal instruments were administered. Despite the grade retention of over 75 percent of the pupils and the generally favorable educational and environmental conditions, they were reading on the average about 2 years below their actual grade placement. The 10  instructors who provided the clinic tutoring identified for each pupil factors which may have contributed to the reading disability. Factors associated with general immaturity and emotional problems were prevalent for most pupils; family pathology was third in importance. It was reported that the incidence of the condition of developmental dyslexia among the regional school population sampled in this study was less than 1 percent. Tables and references are included.

The major purpose of experiments one, two, and four was to examine variables that may influence the frequency and nature of IAR's and to clarify the role of IAR's in learning and retention. Experiment three was designed to explore a second variable, the effects of instructions to pronounce words during learning on subsequent recognition performance. The subjects of the first two experiments were students at Northwestern  University; children from prekindergarten through fourth grade were the subjects in the third and fourth experiments. Results indicated that associative encoding processes were modified by variation of the semantic context of the to-be-remembered word, that the perceived situational frequency of a word was critical in the recognition decision, that advance information had little effect on encoding but did affect the recognition-decision process, and that recognition performance was best when words were overtly pronounced.

Three variables were used: vocabulary level, degree of consensual response to meaning, and response to organization when it was added to the reading material. Systematically combining the three levels of response produced eight categories of subjects who showed reading comprehension difficulty. The eight categories were (1) overall reading skill deficient; (2) language deficient; (3) idiosyncratic responder; (4) nonorganizer; (5) language deficient and nonorganizer; (6) idiosyncratic responder and nonorganizer; (7) skill deficient, language deficient, and nonorganizer; and (8) no apparent difficulty. The model was applied to selected and matched good and  poor readers, and 40 of the 48 subjects could be categorized adequately.

        "description":"The independent reading behavior of 150 achieving fifth graders was investigated. Attention was directed toward the quality and variety of choice as well as to the number of books read. These variables were intercorrelated with standardized achievement tests, IQ, and a number of noncognitive and demographic variables. Indices of quantity, variety, and quality were derived from (1) records of library usage, (2) the child's own record of books read, and (3) time records of out-of-school activities. Correspondence across data sources supported validity. Significant findings suggested that (1) quantity of reading was related positively to reading efficiency, intelligence, socioeconomic class, and attitude toward reading, (2) avid readers were characterized by distinctive personality  patterns which were different for boys and girls, (3) variety of reading increased as a function of quantity, and (4) quality of reading was negatively related to quantity, efficiency, IQ, and reading attitude. It was concluded that efficient readers do not necessarily attain the broad pattern of reading maturity as conceptualized by Gray and Rogers, and that standardized tests are an inadequate measure of the quality and variety of independent reading.

Two methods for analyzing electronic weapon systems were developed, one method for the operator task and one for the maintenance task. These methods were then used to establish the content of a training program for the operation and maintenance of the M33 Antiaircraft Fire Control System. A 12-week (400 academic hours) experimental training program was administered to a group of students who were matched in background with a group of students from the standard 30-week (1000 academic hours) M33 repairman course sequence. After graduation from  their respective courses, 20 students from the experimental group and 17 students from the standard group were tested as rapairmen. They were tested on their ability to energize, adjust, and trouble shoot the individual parts of the M33 system. Both groups of students scored equally well on this performance test. The researchers concluded that considerable training time can be saved, with no loss in performance skill, using a training course based on the methods developed in this research. (LC)",

The previous study, Technical Report #38, succeeded in teaching conservation of numerousness to small groups of kindergarten children, in a middle-class community. The purpose of the present study was to determine if the typical classroom teacher, in schools differing in socio-economic levels, could successfully use the lessons developed in the previous study to effect conservation of numerousness with kindergarten children. Four questions were considered - (1) can the typical classroom teacher teach the conservation lessons as successfully as a specially trained expert, (2) is the treatment of greater value for pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, (3) is the treatment  of greater value for younger kindergarten children than for older ones, and (4) do younger children from disadvantaged backgrounds, who may have more cognitive flexibility, benefit more from the lessons? The \"Test of Conservation of Numerousness\" was presented to 484 kindergarten students partitioned into a control and two experimental groups.

This was followed by a two-week summer session in which they were prepared to teach other teachers. Results of the evaluation  indicate that: (1) one semester inservice course produced a change in the teacher's style of teaching science, (2) the major constraint limiting the full implementation of the new elementary science programs was the quantity of equipment and materials needed, and (3) principals became involved in implementation only if specific efforts were made to get them involved.

The 18 laboratory experiences in this unit, as in all I-CLS units, are inquiry related and designed primarily to develop an understanding of how a scientist expects his world to behave. The format for each laboratory experience is as follows: Introduction, Materials and Equipment,  Collecting Data, and Follow-up. (BR)",

The sourcebook is divided into two major sections: a population bibliography and a guide to population organizations and programs. It also includes a glossory of common demographic terms. The bibliography introduces the layman to general works on population and then, in some 50 categories and subcategories, offers a broad spectrum of more specialized but non-technical treatments. The 430 entries are arranged alphabetically by author, with information on  the publisher, date and place of publication, length of work and retail price. Out-of-print books of particular merit are identified. The second section presents a basic picture of graduate-level university population centers in the United States, the location and resources of non-university population libraries open to outside researchers, the major private U.

The materials were used in 21 fifth grade classrooms in four Oregon school districts. The classes were divided into three treatment groups which were distributed among the schools. Treatment 1 consisted of students who read at one of five levels as determined by an individual formal reading inventory. Treatment 2 students read at one of five levels as determined by a group informal reading inventory. Treatment 3 students read at only the middle level of the five levels supplied by the publishers. Analysis of variance revealed no significant differences in achievement on criterion tests  items among the treatment groups. The results indicate that the informal reading inventory will place students 1.3 years lower in the materials used in this study than would the Metropolitan Reading Achievement tests. Data on teacher rating indicated that teacher effectiveness was a valid area for further research. (BR)",

Approximately 60 classes near Madison, Wisconsin, participated in the study. Tests were administered at four times during the year to a random sample of students to provide a profile of performance change. As a result of these tests, changes were made in the television presentations. It was concluded that item-sampling had the following advantages over traditional achievement testing: (1) more detailed information is provided, (2) planning and review are more effective, (3) transient aspects become evident, (4) revision is more effectively  accomplished, and (5) it is more economical of time and money.

Sixty-six high school students were taught a restricted statement of one of three strategies of varying generality. Twenty-two of these students served as a control group. All subjects were tested on six problems which were based on a variant of the game \"NIM\". The first two problems were within the scope of the most specific strategy, the second two were within the scope of more general strategies, and the last two were within the scope of the most general strategy. Results indicate that restricted rule statements may provide an adequate basis for generalization. Also, performance on the  second problem of each pair was contingent on performance on the corresponding first problems indicating that what is learned may be determined by performance on single test items and used to predict performance on additional similar-scope problems.

        "description":"In the planning phase of this ESEA Title III Project, a learning unit was developed to serve as an outline for the first draft of the model. The field-lab approach is stressed in the belief that the &quot;real world&quot; offers a unique learning opportunity, since it includes the &quot;how&quot; of living as well as the inquiry process of decision-making in the selection of solutions to problems. The curriculum content is centered around one specific problem: How does man provide for and conserve an indispensable resource --water? The scope of instruction is outlined in terms of specific concepts and generalizations, and instructional behavioral objectives. The inquiry teaching strategy is discussed with reference to the cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy (cognitive and affective domains). A  teacher background booklet provides descriptive material on the field-lab: the Quabbin Reservoir System in Massachusetts. Bibliographies are included for activities, teacher resources, student books, and the references used in the model development. The revised version of the Test for Concept Learning and Identification of the Cognitive Process (SO 000 085) is appended. SO 000 069 and SO 000 070 describe Curriculum Model #2 and the general R-L-L Curriculum Model. (SBE)",

The teacher-directed Taba Model has been modified and combined with the R-L-L Model and is based on the theory that learning is a continuous process; 5) Evaluation through feedback of the learning  experiences in terms of their function in the process of conceptualization; 6) A test for concept development. Reflecting concern with the &quot;real world,&quot; each model is designed as a learning unit which utilizes the community as a laboratory.

Subjects were five classes selected from a program viewed by both teachers and pupils as process-oriented; five from a program viewed by both teachers and pupils as content oriented. Ten hours of class discussion (five in each program) were audio-taped. Raters coded questions according to the Teacher-Pupil Question Inventory (TPQI). The TPQI has nine categories, seven of which are based on the Bloom taxonomy and the formulations of Sanders; the remaining two classifications, affective and procedural, include non-cognitive questions. Data obtained were treated by a mixed model ANOVA design. Data analysis showed: 1) No significant  difference between programs in the mean numbers of questions asked. 2) Over-all, memory, interpretation, and procedure questions (lower level cognitive processes) were asked most frequently by both teachers and students. 3) The teachers asked three times as many questions as the students. 4) None of the interactions was significant. Further research is needed to ascertain why higher cognitive levels of questions in the process-oriented programs were not asked. (Author/DJB)",

Considerable field work takes the classroom into the city for visits to organizations, interviews, photographs,  community; surveys, participation in community meetings and political life, and data gathering on housing, jobs, and education. Observation and data are recorded, analyzed, and reported to the class.

The HSGP has utilized new findings in learning theory and studies of the structure of knowledge. (1) The college teacher, who is a subject specialist, produces better instructional materials if aided by specialists in such processes of teaching as concept formation and use, value and motive formation, analysis of objectives, epistemological analysis, and programming. (2) Concept-orientation should be foremost; that is, information should be used only to the extent necessary to teach geographical concepts. (3) A wide variety of instructional media,  offering diverse perceptual experiences to the students' senses, increases the probability that interest will be maintained and that concepts will be learned, concept formation being a non-verbal process. (4) Inquiry learning underlies all of the other strategies, since it is in sensing and solving problems that students learn. Implications of adopting these strategies, as well as possible obstacles to their adoption, are also discussed. This paper will be published in Journal of Geography, December 1970. (DJB)",

The resultant scores are useful only for measuring the suitability of the format and type of task for testing retarded children. These scores can determine the following: 1) whether or not retarded children have the prerequisite perceptual, verbal and motor skills to perform the tasks; 2) how many pretraining items are needed in order to make this procedure useable; 3) how the test procedure relates to age and other student characteristics. If this technique is successful it will be used in a forthcoming Social Competence Assessment Profile (SCAP) which is specifically designed for measuring the social  learning of retarded children. P-SCAP test procedures give the children an opportunity to manipulate some educational pictures in a game-like situation.

No attempt is made to recommend teaching methods or activities, but the author urges supplementation of elementary and secondary social studies courses and materials, most of which overlook or distort the role of blacks in American history. The first part of the manual, Survey of Afro-American History, is divided into 16 historical periods paralleling similar divisions in American history courses, e.g.: The African Past; Black Power During the Reconstruction Period; Depression and the New Deal; Black Nationalism. Each section surveys its period with an emphasis on Afro-Americans, and notes three  to five related specialized works. The second part comprises a 40-page topical bibliography to aid teachers and librarians in adding to their Afro-American studies materials. It covers bibliographies, teacher guides, biographies, general histories and documentary collections, African history and culture, contemporary issues, black art, children's books, newspapers and periodicals, films and filmsetips, sound recordings, and organizations and publishers.

These questions have to do with: 1) trends in the societal environment creating pressures for changes in social studies/social science education; 2) major trends of present and future change in the lifespace of the young; 3) possible future curriculum and student transactions; 4) helps and hindrances in achieving goals; 5) what first steps to take now. Listing ten societal trends and images of the future, and six trends in the lifespace of the young, the author extrapolates from them to describe elementary and secondary schools of the future. He  considers these glimpses of future curriculum and teaching activities relevant to present-day planning, suggests problems and potentialities of trends toward change, and discusses possible first steps toward change in social science education, which will play a core role in school programs and the lives of the young.

Phase 1 of the Curriculum was distributed and the system for evaluation was explained. During this period the project could determine the amount of time teachers had available to devote to the curriculum evaluation process and the most suitable format for collecting the evaluative data within that time. The Teachers' Evaluation Sheet was used as an early and temporary evaluation format primarily concerned with gathering qualitative information on: content, background information, readiness assessment, pre-evaluation of social knowledge, and general teaching principles and strategies. Evaluation  Booklets (171) were returned; the teachers' comments on each section and each activity in the curriculum were tabulated to provide a summary of how teachers viewed Phase 1.

Statistical analysis of test results for 62 undergraduate music majors at the University of Wisconsin and 38 experienced secondary choral teachers in the state of Wisconsin indicated that there was no significant difference in the performance of the two groups, but that those teachers with 6 to 10 years of teaching experience did significantly better than the undergraduate music majors. It was also noted that  subjects holding masters degrees (usually the same as those with 6 to 10 years of experience) performed better on the PED test than juniors, seniors, and bachelors degree holders, and that students who maintained an A average in 2 years of music theory did significantly better on the test than other students. These findings suggest that although teaching experience does not seem to contribute to improving competency in pitch error detection, graduate study and a good grasp of music theory may be related to this competency.

Evaluation will function as a mechanism for gathering feedback information to be used to guide and adjust the variables of the learning environment. Instruction will consist of cooperatively selected experience ranging from individual self instruction to mass instruction in groups of from two to several hundred. As children participate more directly in some of the activities of the  community and as community involvement in the school increases, currently existing gaps in perception and expectation will be narrowed.

Rationale and procedures are described for the development of specifications based on actual teaching behavior. Classification of the specifications is based on the Taxonomy of Educational Objectives. Each of the 224 desired behaviors in the main listing is  classified according to the highest level of cognitive and affective development necessary for optimum performance in specific positions. Cognitive level categories are: 1) knowledge, 2) comprehension, 3) application, 4) analysis, 5) synthesis, and 6) evaluation. Affective level categories are: 1) receiving, 2) responding, 3) valuing, 4) organization, and 5) characterization. Sub-groups within the 224-item list are Cognitive Processes, Psychology, Pedagogy, Philosophy, Religion, Media, Guidance and Counseling, and Social Foundations of Education.

A PM entitled &quot;Magnetism, Electricity, Heat and Microscopic Viewing in Science Instruction&quot; was prepared which described performance behaviors and a variety of learning activities that would enable a student to acquire them: a laboratory practicum, attendant readings, individual and small group instruction sessions. The 17 senior student subjects were given copies of the PM and of a laboratory handbook written to guide them in the laboratory practicum. Each was responsible for selecting the learning activities that would best help him to acquire each performance behavior. Subjects evaluated the program by answering six specific  questions regarding number of activities completed, amount of reading, number of small group sessions attended, size of learning stations, and organization of the handbook and of the program. Analysis and interpretation of the data led to these conclusions: (1) all students in the trial group reacted positively toward the program; (2) interest was generated in the laboratory practicum, 15 of the 17 completing all activities described in the handbook; (3) the PM permitted students to work individually, with indication that individual differences were met as students worked at a rate according to their abilities and desires.

The modules offer students a wide range of options and provide instructors greater flexibility and manageability and subject matter presentations. Before the new program was initiated students took three semester-long foundations courses: school and society, learning, and human development. Three years ago a staff and student committee began inventory of subject matter and development of the new program in which students may choose from among one-credit modular units in the same three foundations areas. Although a total of six to nine credits is still required, only one unit or credit must be completed in  each of the three areas. Two attitude surveys were administered by the committee (to 122 teachers completing their internship and to 266 students during their module orientation) to obtain an overview on what modular content might be and when modules might be offered relative to student teaching methods courses. Administrative concerns which are still being explored in the formative stage of the program include the danger of over fractionation, the need for continuity across modules, and the problem of disseminating information to prospective teachers about what to expect from modules, which to choose, and when to enroll.

Tape recordings of 50 supervisor-teacher conferences were collected. They were analyzed by use of a 15-category interaction system developed by Blumberg using behavioral categories developed by Flanders and Bales. The 50 recordings were tallied and transferred to individual matrixes and a composite matrix producing data which was analyzed by several methods, e.g., percentage comparisons of various combinations of column totals and area analyses to identify extended use of particular kinds of behavior. The resultant data gave rise to a number of questions  about the nature of supervisor-teacher interaction, problemsolving styles of supervisors, the productivity of supervision, and the assumptions that underly it. It was concluded that the methodology carries with it the seeds of a training for supervisor behavior change.

The Commission also states its opposition to a return to litigation as a means of enforcing desegregation rather than administrative enforcement through Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It emphasizes the traditional role of the school as a socializing force and takes exception to the President's comment that it is asking too much of the school to play this role. The Commission also discusses the ideas of busing and\"neighborhood schools,\" noting that the important factor is the quality of the education that children receive, and not where they are educated or how they get there.

Two approaches were used, one involving an analysis of forces judged to have had an important impact on education in the 1960s, and the other based on the perceptions of superintendents and professors about trends and needs in preparation. Six currently significant forces shaping educational organization and leadership were identified as: the federal thrust in education; the Negro protest movement; the changing character of the business education interface; the increase in teacher militancy; the diffusion of special management technologies in education; and the growth of research and development in education. The literature on administration  preparation was reviewed and a questionnaire administered to a sample of 180 chief school officers and personnel in 46 University Council for Educational Administration member universities, to determine the characteristics of current preparatory programs, changes made in the past 5 years, perceived strengths and weaknesses in the programs, and desirable changes for the next decade. Data from both the force analyses and the survey were analyzed to determine the major change needed. Recommendations were developed for program content and structure, recruitment and selection, instructional approaches, field related experiences, program evaluation and development, and departmental functions and staffing.

He conducted research on educational testing and methods of test analysis, and audited several graduate courses in statistics. Reading activity was concentrated on general education in American universities, statistical analysis, and the Rasch method of test analysis. The year's experience led to the development of several ideas for further defining the as yet ambiguous role of a postdoctoral fellow within the host institution. Establishing informal contacts with faculty members, auditing graduate classes, working  closely with one particular faculty member, associating oneself with a research project, or teaching for one semester are some of the possible approaches toward optimizing the benefits of a postdoctoral experience.

Funds were made available to individual faculty members in education and related fields to cover released time, research assistance, clerical assistance, and consultants. Proposals from individuals were reviewed by the R. and D. Committee and acted upon by the Coordinator of Educational Research and 29 individual satellite grants were awarded. (Summaries of these projects, including the amount of the grant, purpose, procedure, and follow-up report, are included.) Faculty members were encouraged to upgrade their research capabilities to a point where they could compete for their own  research funds from other sources of funding. Five research grant applications have been submitted, with three more in preparation; four grants totalling $88,782 have been awarded; five publications based on research projects have appeared and six more are planned. A major advantage of the project was the quick accessibility of funds, which facilitated planning and the hiring of assistants; projects could be initiated while major funding was being sought and reinforcing data for applications provided. A continuing program is recommended to provide \"underwriting\" money and modest research activities, and to insure the continued commitment of the University to educational research. (MBM)",

It was hypothesized that training conditions which provide the most information regarding inquiring questions and which require the fewest steps to induce this behavior, produce greater behavior change than those which provide less information and require more steps to induce criterion behavior; also that training by model imitation produces greater behavioral change as measured by teacher performance in  microteaching situations than does problem solving training; and that problem solving training with fewer steps to solution produces greater behavior change than that with more steps. Seven treatment groups and two control groups were used, with a total of 118 subjects. The results supported a null hypothesis since the increased use of the desired behavior displayed by the treatment groups was not significantly different from the control group. Trainee behavior tended to change in the direction predicted by the information processing model used. Data suggest that training methods were differentially effective for trainees who scored high or low on the initial pretest. (Author/MBM)",

Among the implications for teacher education are these: Prospective teachers need to gain part of their own liberal arts and professional education through the new medium and need to become familiar with the available elementary and secondary level programs. Regarding the fulfillment of the dream of applying computers to the solution of educational problems, we have at present a dual failure: the awful problem of getting operational and the low quality of too many present approaches to CAI (computer assisted instruction). The great failure is at the conceptual level, most existent  programs not even attempting to fulfill the basic potential that the computer offers. The need is for those working with traditional CAI programs to develop a new concept in which the material we present is not nearly as important as the learner's ability to make alternative choices, to raise intelligent questions, and to seek responses to them by calling for and applying available and pertinent data. The companies involved in developing new generations of hardware must accept responsibility for the development and use of software for educational purposes, including either agreement on a common language or provision of translators so that programs may be usable on more than one system.

        "author":["Clark, Michael C."],
        "description":"Computer technology per se is not a solution to the problem of the current \"crisis in content\" in teacher education programs. Computer assisted instruction (CAI) is defined as the on-line interaction of a student with a computer program for purposes of instruction. The drill-and-practice and tutorial CAI programs serve merely as a medium for presenting assigned content, doing little to make content more relevant to the learner. However, the CAI simulation programs can be more than just media manipulation. With appropriate content they can increase the trainee's concern level, thus functioning as compressed experience, bringing the learner's perception of his needs more in line with the content of educational psychology courses. Computer managed instruction (CMI), which utilizes  the powerful information storage, manipulation, and retrieval capabilities of the computer for such purposes as the diagnosis of learner deficiencies, prescription of instructional tasks, record keeping, etc., appears to open up other vast changes in teacher education programs by attempting to relate the program more effectively to the learner. Flexible (highly individualized) self-paced, modular, performance curriculum programs then become possible so that CAI in its narrower definition can be reconsidered. Finally, the advent of CAI-CMI and other computer techniques into the public schools necessitates their introduction as a content area into the teacher education curriculum. (JS)",

Forty undergraduate teacher trainees, who had previously been administered the Test Anxiety Questionnaire for division into high anxious and low anxious groups, were required to teach a student on a concept formation task. The student to be taught was a confederate whose performance was determined a priori and was the same for all teachers. Each teacher was set to expect a certain level of performance by his &quot;student&quot; through instructions regarding the difficulty of  the task and the competence of his student. A 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design was employed with two levels each of anxiety, student competence, and task difficulty. Teachers were assigned randomly within each anxiety level to the four conditions. Each teacher presented the concept through a series of stimulus cards he gave to the student (behind a screen). Upon receiving each student response card he exercised his option of five responses in the form of reward and punishment tokens. Positive and negative reinforcements of teachers were analyzed separately. Data after analyses of variance came out as predicted but not significantly so. (Implications are discussed.) (JS)",

The program is planned for five semesters, at one-half time or nine college units per semester. At the end of the second semester students begin to take paid partnership and other part-time teaching positions when each student is ready and when positions become available in cooperating schools. Professional training consists of self-directed learning experiences aimed at the achievement of a behaviorally defined goal  stated in a &quot;goals paper&quot; written before entry into the program. Students organize their learning experiences in weekly conferences with the program director, who has the authority and resources necessary to provide these experiences. Teachers receive New York State certification upon completion of the program. Future plans include a 30-minute documentary on the program to be ready in September 1970, an extensive evaluation of the program and its graduates, and the possible development of an MTPT school, using personnel already trained in the program.

Group 1 received traditional supervision: classroom visits from the university supervisor, each followed by a conference to reexamine the student teacher's behavior. Group 2 received traditional supervision supplemented by viewings and discussion of selected films and video tape recordings of experienced teachers using the teaching strategy. Group 3 received traditional supervision supplemented by viewings of  video tape recordings of their own teaching behavior. A rating of each subject's teaching performance was obtained from a 20-minute video taped post-lab discussion session. The degree of inductive indirect strategy exhibited was measured with the Teaching Strategies Observation Differential (TSOD) (SE008 655) by four trained raters, two randomly assigned to view each tape. Overall results of the study were not statistically compelling although group norms on the criterion measure follow the hypothesized trend.

All Ss then read and were tested on a 300-word prose passage. Simple and multiple  inferential statistical comparisons of the mean scores on OL and transfer tests for eleven treatment and control groups revealed that deductive learning was superior to inductive in OL and transfer tests; training on identifying attributes improved performance on transfer tests but not on OL; receiving practice in classifying, with and without strategy, did not significantly improve performance. Results suggest that teaching selection strategies does not readily improve performance on complex classification tasks; deductive approaches to learning concepts are more efficient in original learning and in transfer; prior training on the elements of a concept is a potent variable effective in facilitation transfer.

An introductory section discusses developments in communication analysis. The Miniaturized Total Interaction Analysis System (Mini-TIA) is described as an extension of the Flanders and Galloway techniques which 1) uses time sampling techniques with matrix data interpretation, 2) features reciprocal categories, 3) maintains a reasonable limit on the number of categories for economy and efficiency, and 4) directs observer focus to reception as well as transmission of communication events. A table presents the Mini-TIA categories, seven verbal categories each  subdivided into two categories according to the nature of the nonverbal events that parallel the verbal events. Recording with the Mini-TIA system is described, and the major matrix zones are depicted. An observer reliability study is reported in which 39 of 52 preservice teachers trained to use the system achieved a reliability level of .60 or higher, demonstrating that the system is functional and can be taught to observers who can record interaction reliably. Another study is reported which explored the relationship between Mini-TIA data and learner perception of classroom events (as measured by an adjectival checklist), concluding that further study of that relationship is needed.

For the 1969-70 academic year 15 junior or senior elementary or secondary teacher candidates have been selected to participate in a 10-week term of study in Sierra Leone, West Africa. During the autumn term preceding the field study, they will study the culture, government, and educational system of Sierra Leone. While in Africa they will work with Sierra Leone teachers as teacher aides, attend some classes for teachers in a college or university, and prepare a research project on a topic related to education, social  values, or culture of Sierre Leone. On return to Otterbein they will summarize their experiences and relate them to teaching situations they are likely to experience. The college supervisor who will work with the students in Africa will also conduct the seminars preceding and following the field experience term. While the primary objective is to prepare teachers better, it is expected that students not participating will also benefit through formal classroom sharing and informal student conversation. Evaluation will be an integral part of the $26,000-a-year program which is planned for 3 years of operation subject to annual evaluation. (JS)",

        "description":"An experiment was conducted to determine if the use of rules to guide revisions has generalizable effects across programs and programers. The hypothesis was that pupil achievement would be greater for instructional programs revised according to specified rules than for unrevised programs. Each of 10 programers produced a self-instructional sequence for fifth graders. The 50-frame programs including pretest and 10-item posttests were to take approximately one hour to complete. After each was administered to two fifth graders the first draft programs with technical performance data were randomly distributed to the programers with a set of rules for use in revision. Then 64 fifth graders were randomly assigned to receive either a first draft or revised program. Scores were averaged  for each condition, first draft or revision, for each program and the mean for each program per condition provided the unit of analysis. A t test based on the paired observation model was employed using the S's mean performance per condition, matched by program, as the entry. An omega square value to test the strength of association was computed. It was inferred from the results that empirical revision based on rules pays off modestly, i.e., instructions can be provided so that the efforts expanded in revision will have some effect on the obtained levels of pupil performance. Confidence limits for the difference were calculated so that cost of revision could be assessed. [Not available in hardcopy due to marginal legibility of original document.] (JS)",

And if multiple rating styles are found, what are their characteristics? Rated events were 10-minute segments from videotapes of high school classes in four different subjects. The 50-minute composite videotape was viewed by 83 subjects (teachers, teacher trainees, school administrators, and graduate students) using a 21-item questionnaire synthesized from a variety of sources to sample three aspects of teaching behavior: intended  objectives, teaching style, and interpersonal climate. The data from ratings of the four classrooms with the 21 scales formed an 83 x 21 x 4 data array. Two analyses were performed on the extended matrix: principal component analysis of covariances and correlations between rows. Additional analytical procedures were employed to characterize generalized rating styles. Conclusions are methodological rather than substantive: The analytical procedures offer the possibility of providing more information about the quality of ratings than is provided by more traditional reliability estimation procedures, and provide a basis for selecting raters having rating styles of particular interest.

Questionnaire respondents indicated that they consider the TEAM Project program an improvement over existing programs and are using certain parts of it. External and internal criteria disclosed several weaknesses such as the lack of a sound philosophy of the nature of teaching, poor selection of source materials, and inadequate attention given to the type of learning activities to be utilized in presenting  the content included in the various topics. Several strengths also appeared. They include the use of an organizing center, the use of teacher behaviors as a basis for the program, and the guideline that the natural dynamics of the teaching-learning situation should serve as the organizational framework for teacher education programs.

The hierarchy was divided into several different linear and scrambled versions according to the amount of memory and information reorganization required to learn the material. The linear and scrambled versions were then administered to two groups of 80 high school students. Factoral analysis of results showed a significant difference in achievement between students using the linear version and those using a scrambled version for  the lower degrees of memory requirement. However, there was no difference in achievement at the higher levels of memory requirement. Conclusions were that sequence does have an effect in programed instruction when a certain optimal memory load is not exceeded, and that further research should be done on the learning mechanisms involved in programed instruction.

The analysis showed that blacks attained lower levels than nonblacks both in income and prestige, principally as a result of lower growth rates rather than substantially lower starting points. There is a relatively small continuous effect of education on income, slightly smaller for blacks than for nonblacks, but high incomes for blacks are less stable than for nonblacks. Black and nonblack distribution of prestige remain in the same  relative position. The analysis shows that the father's education and occupation and the mother's education all show independent effects on the son's educational attainment. For blacks and mother's education is of greater importance than the other two background characteristics, while among nonblacks the three characteristics are of approximately equal weight. There is a much stronger relationship between the occupation of father and that of son for nonblacks than for blacks. (Author/MBM)",

The study also investigated the length of time necessary to demonstrate marked changes in behavior and the effect of social reinforcement on non-target class members. Subjects were six eighth-grade classes. Three students in each class were identified by the teacher as disruptive (target students) and were the object of social reinforcement techniques. Teacher and student behavior was observed and recorded during a baseline period of several weeks, and then teachers were instructed in the principles of social reinforcement. Further observations were made during a random sequence of varied-length control and experimental  conditions. Analysis of student behavior revealed a significant change in the behavior of both target and non-target students during experimental conditions. There was also a significant difference between short and long time periods. It is concluded that social reinforcemend can improve the classroom behavior of economically disadvantaged adolescents.

The primary method used was the mailed survey, with some interviews, and a second questionnaire was sent to a sample of the respondents to the first, asking them to list the specific types of information needed, indicate where they have been able to obtain it, and show how useful it had been in helping them to make a decision.  Results showed that the search for information is often disorganized. Larger school districts have generally adopted more innovations than smaller ones, and have better access to information, the preferred source being direct contact with personnel in other districts, supplemented by the extensive use of printed material, professional libraries, and information services. Clarity and conciseness are regarded as of primary importance. In higher education institutions special information is frequently obtained from institutions involved in similar changes, while some have set up long range planning and research activities. (MBM)",

Its aim is to help trainers familiarize teachers with the theory and proper use of the Reinforced Readiness Requisites (RRR) program, a series of 145 lessons designed to give standard kindergarten and first grade entry and reading readiness skills to Mexican-American and Indian children. The RRR program is based on tangible rewards and group cooperation. In the initial stage of the one-year program, children are given toys if the class as a whole meets performance criteria in a lesson. Later the toys are replaced by tokens, and then the tokens are also phased out. The booklet contains an explanation of the theory behind the program; questions for group discussion; scenarios for role playing; storyboards and scripts of two  slide presentations--one on the program content and the other on the reinforcement techniques; three sample lessons; and a nine-category classroom observation schedule . An appendix contains a list of media materials and written handouts which accompany the RRR teacher training program. (RT)",

The four hypotheses tested were: 1) There will be a significant change in teacher behavior when there is change in student behavior. 2) Teacher behavior will be significantly more positive during periods of positive rather than negative student behavior. 3) Teacher behavior will be significantly more positive during periods of positive rather than natural student behavior. 4) Teacher behavior will be significantly more positive during periods of natural rather than negative student behavior. Twenty-four college teachers were used as subjects and were  not the assigned teacher of the 24 undergraduate and graduate education classes in which the experiment took place, nor did they know that an experiment was being conducted. Verbal and nonverbal aspects of teacher behavior were measured, using the Flanders Interaction Analysis instrument and the Visual Observational Schedule of Teacher Behaviors. These instruments, with the statistical analyses of observations, are included in the document. The results of all the analyses were consistent, supporting hypotheses one, two, and four, and not supporting hypothesis three. (MBM)",

The context areas were: 1) clinical experiences in health and recreation, 2) clinical-tutorial experiences in measurement, 3) individualized teaching, 4) supervised teaching. The project was evaluated by means of participant comments, pre- and post-tests of participants and a control group on the Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory (MTAI), and rating of participants and controls on an Individualized Teaching Analysis (ITA) schedule developed especially for this project. Student comments  were overwhelmingly favorable, and the MTAI and ITA scores indicated that project participants had a significantly more positive attitude toward teaching and used significantly more individualized teaching procedures than the control group. Aspects of the project under study for inclusion in the regular teacher education program include small seminars, independent study, a behavioral approach, and team teaching by faculty.

Although authorities believe that context clues are best used in combination with other methods of word identification, such as phonetic analysis and word form, no hierarchy of difficulty among the many exercises for teaching context clues is known. Subsequently, to measure the degree of difficulty of six different word recognition techniques found in literature, students in grades 3-10 of 11 schools were given six different exercise forms. The results indicated that the more clues given a reader, the more easily he could identify a word. The easiest form provided phonetic and configuration clues with the context clues, while the most difficult form indicated only the  omission of a word. Students, regardless of sex, intelligence, comprehension, or vocabulary and grade level, used the same clues to determine the suitable word. The exercises developed can also be used for teaching context clues in the classroom. (JM)",

Based on these categories, a SOK Module can be developed, for example, to teach literature using the pragmatic (audience-oriented) point of view.

Audio tapes illustrating various kinds of language performance are being collected from selected students at each grade level. These tapes include individual responses made in a teacher-student interview session, informal conversation with peers, discussion with classmates on an assigned topic, and presentation of a narrative.

Eight 30-second silent intervals at natural pauses in the speech gave the students time to respond during the stimulus speech. The subjects completed semantic-differential pre- and post-tests on Malcolm X. Two control groups responded only to the pre- and post-tests--group A without hearing the speech, group B hearing it uninterrupted. Eight scaled evaluative sets were used to determine attitude toward the speaker (i.e., reputable, kind, educated, selfish). Although post-test results for the experimental group and control group B were  remarkably similar (thus negating the possibility of experimental disruptive effects), results obtained from the experimental group during the speech's eight intervals revealed significant shifts in the group's attitude toward the speaker. Informed statements can be made about when changes occurred, at what rate, and in relationship to what speech content. It was concluded that this process analysis of communication presents a fuller, truer description of audience reactions than the traditional static methods of evaluation. (MF)",

They need to foster in their students an interest in and a perspective on language, its history, and the human and social attitudes which language reflects. Stress should be placed on the fundamentals of spelling, on the reasons behind punctuation rules, on writing clarity and conciseness, and on the usefulness of parallelism and subordination for accurate, fluent self-expression. These techniques of composition, however, will be of little value unless the student-writer has something worthwhile to say and has coherently ordered his ideas. (MF)",

The students were divided into groups of five, were trained in methods of group discussion (aided by video tapes to prepare them for profitable analysis of each others' work), and were given personal journals for daily free writing. Students were then asked to write something for the group, and fruitful discussion ensued on the differences between private and public writing, feel for audience, and choice of language and incidents. Units on memory writing, sensory writing, and dramatic writing were taught to develop ability to utilize detail and skills in observation and close textual analysis. The  workshop captured the imagination and enthusiasm of most students (with 45 completing the majority of assignments), although the teachers' initial overemphasis on mechanics and the students' inability to revise created problems. Individual instruction via tape recordings was recommended for teaching proper selling and punctuation. (MF)",

Teachers enrich and supplement children's experiences by collecting objects for the students' examination, using various media, fostering classroom projects, or reading imaginative literature aloud. They avoid textbooks and formal lessons, teach mechanics only upon request, and rarely place grades or extensive comments upon the papers. Instead, the children's work is dignified through inclusion in class booklets or wall displays. English children,  although they informally master mechanics as well as American students, manifest a more spontaneous eagerness to write than their American counterparts, and they produce numerous works of high quality with style and coherence derived from the integrity of their imaginations and perceptions.

This produced a framework of concepts from which a curriculum unit was developed, embodying tactile and visual classroom activities. \"The City as an Act of Will,\"\"The Awareness of Space as Experience,\" and \"Stimulus Movements Systems\" were key themes in the unit which received supportive review from the American Institute of Planners and the Architects Institute of America. A re-development problem was given to an experimental group of students and to two  control groups, to be performed in the presence of a qualified jury consisting of one professional art educator, one professional planner, and one architect. A consensus of the jurors upheld the hypotheses of the study, which were that the experimental students would be more apt to relate form to function and would tend to defend their proposals from a wider frame of reference and be stronger on rebuttal than the control groups. Further curriculum development and teacher education in this area was recommended. (A demonstration lesson is included.) (Author/MF)",

Training sessions--lectures supported by overhead transparencies, study of prepared instructional materials, and  panel presentations--were preceded and followed by tests which revealed that participants improved in ability to state musical behaviors in selected categories and to identify component parts of musical behaviors. Significant shifts of attitude by participants about the subject matter of the sessions were also revealed. (Seventeen tables concerning the background, abilities, attitudes, evaluations, and recommendations of participants are included.) (Author/JM)",

This is discussed in terms of the capacity of the mode to reveal the relationships among decoy options and the effects of partial information, misinformation and guessing. Tests were administered to two groups of subjects and scored according to each of the three treatment modes, classical, weighted choice, and elimination. In addition, subjects were asked to indicate their confidence in the correctness of each answer. Thus, treatment, confidence, and knowledge scores were computed for each subject and a Gulliksen-Wilks regression test was performed on the data to compare the validity and  reliability of the three scoring modes. The results generally support the hypothesized superiority of the elimination scores. Elimination produced higher validities and reliabilities and less guessing than either of the other two treatments. Although the design did not permit a definitive comparison of elimination and confidence scores, there was some evidence that elimination scores were at least as valid as confidence scores.

If the decision involves selecting some fixed quota from the high (or low) end of an available competence continuum, then norm-referenced measurement is indicated. If, however, the decision involves certifying the attainment of some \"a priori\" standard of competence whether in some practitioner field or in some tool-skill academic field, then criterion-referenced measurement is indicated. In short, the choice between these two strategies should reflect the relative importance of quotas and standards in these decisions.

Analysis of the test results revealed a moderate to insignificant relationship between scores on a CLEP exam and the amount of course work in the related field. UW performance was higher than the national norm. CLEP performance was related positively to college grades and reflected the application of traditional scholastic abilities. Analysis also inferred correlation  between performance on a CLEP exam and experience in the related curriculum. CLEP Humanities and Social Sciences-History are almost totally described by a verbal component, whereas CLEP Natural Sciences shows significant loadings on problem solving, verbal, and quantitative factors in that order.

Teacher awareness of student IQ appeared not to influence, to a statistically significant degree, her ratings of students overall achievement relative to one another. It did, however, appear to influence (p .05) the IQ scores she assigned to her students. When the score reported to the teacher was considerably discrepant (10 points or more) from that which she estimated for the student, a second estimate of the child's IQ score appeared to change considerably. The manner in which IQ test results were communicated to teachers appeared to have  no significant influence on their estimates of students' scores. However, it did appear to influence their estimates of the students' overall achievement relative to one another. The results indicate that the procedure of changing teacher expectancy must be thoroughly investigated. (Author/GS)",

Several indices are collected: (1) The instructor's objectives and test questions, classified using the Taxonomy of Intellectual Abilities, an adaptation of Bloom's Taxonomy. This provides one index of intended and actual cognitive emphasis of the course. (2) The Cognitive Activities Rating Scale (CARS), also based on Bloom's Taxonomy, lists class activities calling for each kind of  thinking operation. The teacher responds to CARS in terms of &quot;Ideal&quot; class activities. Students respond in terms of the most characteristic course activities. Comparison reveals the congruence of intent and practice. Studies support the accuracy, validity, and reliability of each step in the procedure. A teacher can use the CCP in modifying practices, expectations, and his perception of the instructional process. It should not, however, be used to evaluate teachers since many other teaching dimensions not contained in the CCP are needed for this purpose. CCP, first used with college classes, has been modified for grades six and above in the Illinois Gifted Program Evaluation. (AUTHOR/GS)",

Factors of testing which increase a test's memory load and consequently interfere with comprehension are discussed. It is hypothesized that a test which strains the short-term memory capacity of a child is functioning as an unintended screen to eliminate subjects with inferior memory capacities and does not adequately measure the intended ability. A number of tests randomly selected are examined in terms of three ways in which memory capacities can be overloaded in a test. In conclusion, since there does not appear to be a high correlation between memory skills and the other skills involved in the learning processes, it is  recommended that memory skills be measured as such and that the other skills be assessed independently of the memory screen.

This technique orders subjects on the basis of the similarity of responses of adjacent individuals, not on the basis of the number of times each individual marks the answer keyed as &quot;correct.&quot; The technique is offered as an alternative method for ordering a list of students on the basis of test scores. SRA is based on the theory of minimum inversions; i.e., if the number of matched responses decreases as subjects are further removed from one another in the list, no inversions will occur. However, when subjects A and B, adjacent to one another in the  list, have fewer matched responses than A and C who are not adjacent, then an inversion occurs. The technique is designed to order the subjects so that only a minimum number of inversions can occur. The theory upon which SRA is based is discussed and a computer program for the technique is presented. (Author/ES)",

The Comprehensive Achievement Monitoring (CAM) system can, however, be adapted to meet the information needs at different levels. Several experimental programs in which CAM models have been developed and implemented are described. Included are the use of CAM in research and development, demonstration projects in which CAM is utilized for course revision in convention classroom instruction, CAM combinations with other evaluative techniques for the purpose of evaluation of the work of individual students, and the  use of CAM and small computers to evaluate student progress and assign students to instructional treatments. Finally, the support activities of the State Education Department to local school districts in the areas of program evaluation and management of the instructional process are outlined. (DG)",

One of these new methods, Comprehensive Achievement Monitoring (CAM), designed to monitor the effects of educational innovation, may also be used to stimulate change in the classroom. Traditional classroom testing frequently does not detect possible incongruencies between the teacher's expectations and the students' performance. CAM methodology, however, provides for gathering information about both pre- and post-instruction achievement together with systematic monitoring during the course, all directly related to course objectives. The teacher is offered several types of information which can be used to identify discrepancies between expected achievement and  actual performance and thus provide a motivation to change. Specific definition of expectations, both implicit and explicit, and specific information about performance, as provided by CAM, are essential. Without them the influence on the teacher to change will be slight. (DG)",

The black teacher spoke in a Negro dialect, and the white teacher spoke in a standard or general American dialect. Three tests were administered to measure: (1) concept acceptance, persuasiveness, and source credibility; (2) retention of information; and, (3) racial identity (unrelated to content of presentation). Statistical data were inconclusive. Although black and white students clearly identified with their  respective racial groups, the difference in reference groups have no significant effect on interaction between race of subjects and perceived race of narrator when retention, attitude toward content of narration, or source credibility were the criteria.

But, the use of race in a nonscholarly fashion is held to be professionally inadequate and often detrimental to black Americans. For years, researchers using race to make comparison s between black and white Americans have reportedly based their findings on differences in group means, implying that racial groups are quite different. The example presented in this study uses data on the employment status, arithmetic grade level, and various measures of intelligence (the latter two presented as pre- and post-training measures) collected at the Muskegon Area Skill Training Center. It is contended that one methodology (comparison  of differences between means) demonstrated that a group of white youth and a group of black youth were quite different, while a second methodology (cluster analysis) using the same data on the same youth groups showed that the white group and the black group were quite similar. Following these results, the obligations and responsibilities of researchers are considered to have added significance, especially in view of the current trend toward a divided America. (RJ)",

The answers to this question might imply differences in our approach to improving the education of all children, particularly those we call the disadvantaged, for many of whom school is now a frustrating and unrewarding experience. Dealing with children as individuals is not the greatest problem. It is in our concern about the fact that, when we do so, we have a differentiated educational program, and children of different socially identifiable groups may not be proportionately represented in different  programs. Many environmentally caused differences can be minimized or eliminated, given the resources and the will of society. The differences that remain are a challenge for public education. It is the responsibility of educators to create a diversity of instructional arrangements best suited to the full range of educational differences. (Author/JM)",

Various suggested intensities of participation include: employment-information, dialogue-advice giving, shared authority, and control. The acceptance of citizen participation as a goal may facilitate discussion of the options for participation, while experimentally trying to learn which of the currently exercised options  best achieve certain kinds of goals. Federal policy may be contributing to separation rather than integration through the allocation of responses to competing community structures. Black communities given control resources do not have the option of using these resources for integration, and may have to \"win\" them from other communities of poor people.

The data, except for Brazil, were gathered in a university context. The Brazil sample was 118; U.S.A, 136; and, for the North American Indian, 49. One instrument used to measure Interracial Sensitivity was of the projective, Thematic Apperception Test design. The other instrument measured Racial Definition. To prevent sensitizing the subject, the second instrument was always given after the first. There was no measurable difference found in both the perception and definition of race in different cultures and subcultures. Racial sensitivity was found to be not  scalable. There were no significant effects associated with urbanization which had been thought to sharpen racial sensitivity and consciousness. This study suggests the emergence of some socially significant new trends in patterns of racial response. [Not available in hard copy due to marginal legibility of original document.] (JM)",

Of the entrants nearly one-third enrolled at University Center, approximately one-fourth at Brooklyn College, and almost one-fifth at City College. Hunter, Lehman, and Queens Colleges admitted approximately 10 per cent or less; York College admitted three per cent. Sixty per cent were Negroes born in the U.S.A.; more than one-fourth were Puerto Rican; and six per cent were native-born whites. The remaining ten per cent were foreign-born students. More than half of the class were females. However, American- and foreign-born Negroes had a female majority. Puerto Rican entrants were evenly divided  and all other groups had more than 60 per cent males. Forty-three per cent had high school academic diplomas and 30 per cent had general diplomas. Of the remainder, 15 per cent had vocational, eight per cent commercial, three per cent equivalency, and one per cent technical diplomas. The entire class had an average high school average of 74.

Minority group enrollment constituted approximately four-fifths of the total population of CDP students, while fewer than one-fifth of the regularly matriculated City University students were from comparable deprived groups. Of the first two entering classes, 202 CDP students obtained their degrees at community colleges by January, 1968; most of these students (178) eventually went on to senior colleges. Even for students not earning degrees, research data suggests other personal gains result from exposure to college experience; data indicated that the majority of CDP  participants were committed to the goal of higher education and had positive attitudes toward college. Many of the students who left the program resumed their education or expected to resume it at a later date. Finally, exposure to the CDP experience increased the possibility that students will transmit positive attitudes toward higher education to their families, to the communities from which they came, and to the general public.

        "description":"Although the break-up of the unresponsive school bureaucracy in New York will be a move toward greater accountability, the basic question is: will this raise achievement levels? Its possible advantagees include: the increase in both the operating efficiency of the schools and the responsiveness of schools to the lay public; increased student fate control following from increased parent control; and, the release of creative energies following the synthesis of community and school. The possible dangers include the establishment of a number of small, inefficient bureaucracies, and the abandonment of school integration as a paramount goal. The latter may decrease fate control by emphasizing the child's dependence on his social origins for his educational opportunities. An alternative  to both the extreme neighborhood schools policy and the complete integration policy which would preserve and enhance educational quality is typified by the More Effective Schools program. Decentralization must proceed, but a strong central agency will always be needed. (JM)",

        "description":"This paper analyzes the differences in the relative roles that family social background and family process variables play in the development of achievement and motivation at the individual and at the aggregate or school level. The particular data analysis model employed treated the attributes of the school a student attended as if they were his own attributes. Although this allowed correlations to be generated which formed the bases for regression and commonality analyses, it resulted in difficulties in interpreting the amounts of variability found for each source of variation. Although data was collected on grade levels one, three, six, nine, and twelve, the most reliabile results were for ninth graders. There is a pronounced tendency for students of similar social background to  go to school together. This tendency is also pronounced for \"Achievement,\" but not for \"Motivation.\" In explaining the behavior of students and schools the same relative roles are played by the social background and family process sets of variables for expectations, attitude toward life, and study habits but not for educational plans and achievement. Differences in these relative roles at the individual and aggregate level may occur because already large relationships between social background and other variables are further accentuated when students are allocated schools on the basis of social background.

It is felt that inadequate and biased attention has been given to immigration, slavery, resistance to slavery, Reconstruction, segregation, black self awareness and protest, the discrepancies between American ideals and discrimination, non-Western cultures, and the phenomenon of race as a biological and cultural variable. The use of supplementary audio visual materials, and teacher self examination of personal  attitudes toward race and knowledge of minority groups in America are recommended.

Experimental groups comprised four subjects of the same sex and grade level. Groups representing all Negro were used; all variables were completely crossed. The subjects were 48 male and 48 female seventh and eighth graders from an urban junior high school in Florida. Each sex group was half white and half black in number. The procedure gave the subject fifteen opportunities to conform to the unanimous and incorrect judgment by what appeared to be the other three members of his group. The test related to the area of three different geometric figures drawn on each of 25 different cards. The group appeared  to label the smallest figure as having the largest area. Preliminary analyses provided some evidence that in this population conformity is negatively related to intelligence. Additionally, the ethnic group by source of pressure interaction was the only significant source of variance. Whites conformed more to white peers than to black peers, and the whites conformed more to whites than did Negroes to Negroes.

The staff was ethnically mixed, with varying degrees of educational background and work experience. They were chosen not only for their training competence but also for their ability to relate to a diverse participant group. The basic learning technique was the T-group. Following the first session, the participants were divided into three groups which remained intact for the full four days. The groups generally included  about ten people. Some attempt was made to mix the groups according to race, sex, age, and classification. Two trainers were assigned per group.

The community advisory committee is one strategy which involves community people in program planning in the role of consultants.

Together they intensely study community  problems in an open public forum to achieve creative solutions.

The objective of the conference was to have consultants and participants pool ideas in an effort to improve the education of that student who is the child of the migratory laborer. After the problem areas were defined and the needs of the migrant ascertained, each consultant was requested to prepare a paper relating his area of expertise to one particular aspect of the problems confronting the migratory child.

This cleavage which exists in other industrialized Northern states, border states and certain cities in the South is responsible for general social unrest as well as racial riots in the high schools. The findings of this report contend that racial isolation is harmful for the educational development of affected students. The school is described as a socioeconomic unit which exerts tremendous influence on students. The educational, economic, and social disadvantagement of black students, as well as of other minority group students, is exacerbated and compounded by the segregated school setting. Suggestions are presented for enhancing the  potentially facilitating effects of desegregation. Methods include arranging a social class balance in the classroom, making selective changes in the new kinds of intergroup activities.

The subjects were sixty black inner city and suburban white lower middle class  students. Haller and Miller's Occupational Aspiration Scale was used to measure the students' levels of vocational aspirations.

The study also provides a broad perspective within which to place school construction decisions by analyzing goals, stakeholders' positions, and implementation actions. The main portion of the study highlights how the possible choice between two \"construction\" alternatives (educational parks and mini-schools) is influenced by other crucial urban education policy issues, and the effects of the latter upon the alternatives. In the context of the current situation where major city school systems are in precarious relationship with their environment (parents, civil rights groups, black militants, teachers' unions, and students), questions of  financing, construction, and location of new schools are considered to be interwoven with educational issues (transactional patterns, evidence on probable effects of specific programs, school integration as affecting transactional patterns, and community control), and are analyzed as such in the study. The study concludes that neither of the two facility innovations examined--educational parks and mini-schools--offer much promise to education, and that, despite the skepticism developed in the study relating to community control, the latter would be the choice among the potential driving forces for change to combine with new construction.

The subjects in the tutorial group were forty 16 year-old boys. The control group comprised 28 high school boys closely resembling the tutorial sample. The program emphasized reading and mathematics, with some attention given to art and physical education. School related attitudes of the two groups were measured with a semantic differential devised specifically for this study. Analysis of the data revealed that: (1) in the last three years of school, there was essentially no difference in the scholastic achievement of the two groups tested; (2) at the end of the  program (senior year in high school) the tutorial group's school related attitudes were significantly more positive than those of the control group; (3) for the tutorial group, positive attitudes toward school were not significantly related to intelligence; and, (4) after high school, 82 percent of the tutorial group and 18 perecent of the control group began college. The findings are considered to suggest that attitudinal side effects of educational enrichment programs may have a discernible effect on subsequent striving. (RJ)",

Among the recommendations suggested are: (1) development of a model to bring such cooperative programs to the attention of all citizens; (2) expansion of teacher training programs by schools of education to include appreciation of urban-suburban problems; and, (3) establishment of a national committee on goals for urban-suburban education in order to take care of research on and the funding of such programs.

There was a high correlation between ward in-camp attitudes and reactions and differences in staff orientation and administrative policy. Data from interviews with administrative personnel and non-administrative staff questionnaires revealed wide differences between camps with respect to camp treatment goals, patterns of staff/ward relations, rule and regulation enforcement, counseling and  treatment practice, and attitudes toward job. Similarly, ward questionnaires revealed equally wide between-camp differences in attitudes toward camp staff and programs. Although between-camp differences are related to in-camp ward adjustment and attitude, there is no evidence that these differences influence postrelease rehabilitation.

Problems discovered are similar to those faced in the private sector--employing the disadvantaged conflicts with the desire to hire the best personnel, and it challenges the merit system. An understanding of the philosophy and procedures of the civil service and the constraints they impose on efforts to hire the disadvantaged is necessary to evaluate the attempts being made to resolve the inherent conflict. Washington, D.C. and San Francisco provide contrasting studies of the  efforts and the constraints within the service.

Recommendations that need to be met before comprehensive rehabilitation services will be available are grouped according to the need for: (1) development of an organization to coordinate services, (2)  increased attention in special areas of disability, (3) assurance of diagnostic, restorative, and training resources for the handicapped, (4) health and rehabilitation manpower, and (5) removal of barriers affecting the handicapped. A listing of recommendations in chart form specifies the agencies responsible for meeting the need, the extent of need, and the duration of a program. (SB)",

        "description":"Behavioral scientists have been slow in the development of effective procedures and in empirical validation of psychological testing instruments for selecting law enforcement personnel. This study involved 253 supervisory sergeants and field lieutenants and 2,327 uniformed patrolmen of the Chicago Police Department (CPD). Three major performance measures were tenure, a paired-comparison performance rating which stressed field performance, and the CPD semiannual performance rating which stressed administrative as well as field performance. An occupational test battery, which stressed behavioral requirements of the patrolman's job, provided motivational, intellectual, and behavioral measures. The test battery was administered twice, with a 5-month interval, to allow for validation  analysis. Patrolmen who scored high on the tests were rated high on performance. The degree of this relationship increased when the subgroup of white patrolmen was treated separately and increased even more significantly when the Negro subgroup was treated separately. It was concluded that ideal attributes of patrolmen are all related to stability (1) in parental and personal family life, (2) in self-confidence and emotional behavior, (3) in maintaining cooperative attitudes, and (4) in developing a realistic orientation toward life.

        "description":"The Vocational Education Act of 1963 (P.L. 88-210) specified that funded programs undergo periodic and regular evaluation to determine if participants are being adequately prepared for employment. A quasi-experimental method for objectively evaluating pilot programs is to use appropriate reference groups in lieu of the traditional experimental control group dyad. Appropriate reference groups may consist of similar people without instruction in the vocation, successful practitioners of the vocation, and students in regular vocational high school programs. Evaluation instruments should provide performance measures of those abilities and knowledges required by the vocation under study. Instrument design should duly consider whether the evaluation is summative or formative, that is,  for administrative evaluation of the total program or for internal evaluation. When the behavioral performance-reference groups model was tested in a summative evaluation of pilot Commercial Food Service programs in New Jersey, graduates of regular vocational high school programs scored significantly higher than graduates of pilot programs. Although further study is necessary, the initial findings question the adequacy of training in pilot programs. The evaluation model can be readily used in summative evaluations. (CH)",

Methodological bias and inconsistency between evaluators, along with disinterest by program administrators, have prevented evaluation from reaching its potential in program planning.

A previous study (1966) revealed no job openings for 79 occupational programs offered by state and federal prisons, indicating that correctional institutions face a particular challenge in providing relevant occupational education for the rehabilitation of inmates returning to the world of work. In this study of the desire for occupational training and the occupational preferences of 100 male inmates, data were collected by use of a personal data card, a questionnaire, and the Kuder Preference Record, Form C. The mean educational level for the inmates was 9.3 years. At the time of their present offense, 41 percent did not have full-time employment. It was found that (1) Inmates' occupational  prestige values correlate at .899 (rho) with other individuals, (2) Employment stability and security are valued more than change for advancement, high pay, local employment, or favorable working conditions, (3) 89 percent of incoming inmates desire occupational training, and (4) 92 percent were willing to take remedial courses. Appropriate occupational education offerings for prison inmates appear to be courses in driving, welding, mechanic and repairman, radio and television, and construction occupations. (CH)",

Craig, (3) \"Application of Audiovisual Technology in Medical Education\" by N.L. Cole, (4) \"Concepts in Communication: A Multi-Screen Presentation\" by E.W. Murphy and J.W. Parker, and (5) \"Standardization: The Manufacturer's Viewpoint\" by R.H. Bell and M. Waterbor. In addition, four panel discussions were held on the topics of Basic Science Education and Audiovisuals, The Use of Audiovisuals in Clinical Teaching, Hospitals, and Meeting the Needs of  Continuing Education. Participants recommended that a national resource center be established to serve as a repository for information about available audiovisuals. Further, opportunities should be provided for identifying learner needs and wants and for defining teaching objectives. Finally, educators must exert leadership in setting up standards and guidelines for selection and utilization of audiovisual media. (SB)",

Using this as an objective, data were gathered on current automotive mechanic training programs by reviewing selected government reports and related literature and by interviewing people knowledgeable of such programs. Some major findings are: (1) Public high schools perform most of the automotive mechanic preemployment vocational training, (2) A shortage of highly skilled, experienced mechanics exists while demand for inexperienced graduates of high school automotive mechanic vocational training courses is relatively light, (3) More mechanics are trained annually than are absorbed, and (4) The  present system of selection for participation in a high school preemployment vocational training program is inappropriate and inefficient. The report recommends further studies to establish a training employment system that will (1) provide a realistic level of auto mechanic preemployment training, (2) produce an adequate supply of trained entry-level automotive service and repair personnel, and (3) give reasonable assurance to the enrollee that a competitive wage and a challenging career are available at the entry level.

Based on empiric data collected by interview from 1,232 office employees and their supervisors from four areas of the United States, the educational specifications were drawn from 4,548 basic tasks and 32,447 steps of task performance. Pointed toward the classroom practitioner and learner in public secondary and community college education, the inventory of goals will affect instruction for office  preparation through media developers, state and local supervisors, curriculum committees, teacher educators in business and office education, and certain innovative schools. Additional outputs of NOBELS include (1) a Taxonomy of Office Activities (ED 021 140), (2) two correlative studies on Interaction Critical Incidents and Hardware Used in Office Task Performance, (3) a Talent Inventory, and (4) the NOBELS Verbs and Synonyms.

Results indicated that the teacher group generally had a more favorable attitude toward \"traditional\" instructional resources as opposed to \"progressive\" materials. The traditional materials were also used more often and were more readily available. Relationships between attitude and use and between availability and use were generally positive and significant. Factor analysis of attitude variables revealed  that teachers may view instructional resources in accordance with their personal involvement with resource preparation, selection, presentation, and application.

In addition, a questionnaire to ascertain which laboratory tests the assistant would perform was administered to 18 of the 27 physicians surveyed. Some findings and recommendations were: (1) The need for a gastroenterology assistant was supported, (2) A job description has been formulated, (3) A short on-the-job training program, with a comprehensive training manual, would be appropriate in most cases, (4) The suggested training program could provide a means of upgrading existing personnel skills, and (5) A salary range of $5,000 to $7,000,  with opportunities for advancement, would be adequate in many cases.

The analysis consisted of subdividing the task list into five categories and developing a survey instrument to answer questions about each task function. Currently, 900 survey instruments have been distributed nationally, and the results will be summarized in a later report. The instructional format which allows for individualized instruction, consists of 18 units intended to encompass skills and concepts required for performance in each dental auxiliary functional  area.

The evaluation of each program was studied, particularly the followup of graduates. In addition, on-site evaluations were made by project staff of evaluation problems in 30 programs. The project staff was unable to show that any of the program met the study's criteria for success. Nearly one-half of the programs did not have comprehensive followup information on their graduates, and no trends could be detected nor suitable comparisons made of those approximately 148 programs that had  nearly complete followup records. In order to obtain detailed information on graduates, more complex, fine-grained followup would be required. It was also recommended that a randomized group be selected for followup and that the same procedure be applied to select a comparable group of nonvocational graduates. (Author/SB)",

In exploring the reasons for the apparent resistance to social change, a series of three dissemination activities were organized for school personnel using materials developed on the work orientation of teenagers. These activities provided insight into the problems encountered when endeavoring to promote change. As they were identified, the problems were classified as (1) psychological resistance, (2) sociological resistance, (3) ecological resistance, (4) economic resistance, and (5) political resistance. A suggested general principle to follow in planning such activities is to identify sufficient similarities of the new context  with contexts familiar to the participants.

Creative innovations, individualized attention, change, and flexibility are the guidelines for this well staffed program which offers instruction in vocational education. Half of the students selected for participation needed followup medical treatment, came from homes where parents were either divorced or separated, and ranked low on aptitude. A followup study of students completing the program showed that those students who attended the Center were better paid, possessed positive self concepts, and were  better adjusted than their non-attending peers.

The United States has developed into a technological society with no place for the uneducated, unskilled individual. Though the present educational system works well for the majority, 20 percent of the population is now excluded because of inadequate educational opportunity. The primary reason this nation has not yet established a society in which there is equal opportunity to learn and work is that it has not yet tried. To achieve individual potential, the nation should: (1) recognize that employment is an integral part of education by establishing an employment agency in every secondary school, including part-time employment in the  curriculum, and providing further education for the dropout, (2) give priority to programs for the disadvantaged without separating them from the mainstream of education, (3) encourage parents and students to participate in the development of vocational programs, and (4) establish residential schools for those who need them most.

Six major preoccupations of research are outlined, followed by two chapters on adult education as a discipline and a profession, patterns of adult educational leadership, levels and categories of adult educators, and their learning needs. Chapter 4 covers the growth of graduate education in adult education, numbers of doctorates granted during the period 1935-69, theoretical models for the doctorate, learning objectives, program content, procedures and criteria for evaluating graduate study, and provisions for field work and inservice training. Conclusions touch on such aspects as the  status (firmly established) of adult education as an academic field, the nature of professional education (essentially graduate and postvocational), and the need for research on roles and functions, evaluation of training program outcomes, and the development of suitable measurement instruments.

In the section on Staff Development the writers of this project have detailed some expectations for teachers in the individualization of instruction. Also in this section are detailed some aspects of the Process of Teaching, Teaching Skills which consider Group Process to a small degree, and a section on the Principal as Change Agent. This project has a great responsibility to the rest of the state and for this reason the dissemination section reflects the need to build a model that will serve the SOLVE schools and the new open-concept schools which may number as many as 23 in the State of New Hampshire by September  1972. The evaluation model was done by Heuristics of Massachusetts. It represents the thinking of not only the project writers and heuristics, but also the consultation of H. Stuart Pickard and R. Cliff Wing. The final consideration was the duality of Project SOLVE and its need as a Project on the one hand and the needs of the member schools on the other. To this end the Narrative reflects the need for Project SOLVE regarding personnel and its fulfillment of the objectives for the member schools. (Author)",

The data collected involved approximately 60,000 students from 27 public secondary schools selected within 19 large cities. Interviews were also conducted with administrators, teachers, parents, community people, police and district officials. Questionnaires were completed from secondary schools in the United States that met certain criteria. A copy of the  questionnaire, statistical tables, bibliographies, summarization of findings and recommendations for policy-making are included in this final report. (LS)",

Subjects (130 learners and seven teachers) were given the Ideal Group and Self-Description questionnaires, and measures of perception and satisfaction; each teacher also constructed a test of terminal student proficiency. Overall evidence from analysis of the ego-stage dyadic congruency, the group-relevant congruency, and the preference and perception congruency variables in association with teacher and learner satisfaction and learning achievement, did not  form any assumptions as to their predictive relationships. The data did reveal some strength by the ego-stage dyadic congruency variable, especially in association with the dependent variables of learner achievement. Supplemental analysis of the eight ego stages indicated that teacher-learner dyadic congruency was not significantly related to learner satisfaction. Reasons for the findings were suggested, along with wider implications. Thesis is available from University Microfilms. (LY)",

Studies have been primarily 1) descriptive in nature; 2) oriented toward the outcomes of ABE instruction; and 3) concerned with some aspect of the educational process. Three descriptive studies were concerned with an urban student population involved in ABE and with two farm workers programs. Thirteen studies reported on some educational consequence accruing from the ABE programs; six reported grade level gain as  measured by standardized tests and five reported on dropout rates and retention. Six process studies have been completed; seven are in various stages of completion.

Training was found to be good; but in this report needed improvements are deliberately highlighted. The Task Force found that all of its recommendations can be carried out under the Government Employees Training Act of 1958. Some agency training does not provide knowledge or develop skills needed by management before they are advanced to higher levels; and training is less available in the field than in Washington. Agencies differ widely in the extent and quality of training for specialists. Of the 57 agencies providing the Task Force data, 56 sent employees to interagency training programs; over half of this training was  provided for management--professionals had little coverage and technicians but 17% of courses. Agencies lack clear policies on when employees might appropriately be enrolled in universities. The Civil Service Commission, in a new role, should provide agencies with information, advice, and counsel on training problems in a number of fields. Training and education are capital investments which eventually contribute to the Nation's gross national product. The absence of developmental programs with the resultant loss of peak performance can cost more than training. (NL)",

The population comprised 96 functional illiterates, aged 20 to 60 years; and 36 graduate students, aged 20 to 60 years. The instrument, which was validated by 7 out of 10 previous studies, required checking items of a questionnaire on a six-point continuum. The hypothesis was supported. Rokeach's finding, through use of the DS instrument, is monumental; his confirmed hypothesis that high and low authoritarian subjects differ consistently and in a statistically significant manner on his 40 item DS instrument illustrates that a tool has been found to demonstrate what so many have surmised and written about  descriptively. The relationship between an adult education student's authoritarianism and his learning potential must be understood in order to develop adequate remedial curriculum material, instructional methods, evaluation procedures, and programs.

Initial interviews were used to ascertain nutrition habits and influences thereon, knowledge levels, homemakers' age and education, and family income, race, residence, family size, household items, and families on welfare. Significant changes, often affected by income and food sources, were made by both homemakers and children in consumption of certain foods. The greatest change was in the milk and milk products group; second greatest was the increased use of fruits and vegetables. A moderate change occurred in the use of bread and cereals. The least change was  noted for the meat and meat substitute group. The technique of influencing homemakers through children (and vice versa) proved effective. It is expected that the program will be continued and expanded, and that future nutrition education programs will benefit from knowledge gained in this program.

Another was to identify priorities as guideposts toward which educators and others can direct their efforts more efficiently and effectively during the 1970's. General sessions and separate papers discussed such concerns as job training and hiring, the state of the art of adult basic education, remedial education (including Project 100,000 for military personnel), audiovisual technology, and evaluation criteria for adult basic education  activities. Recommendations were offered on a professional communications system, Federal funding for publishers of instructional materials, and several other matters.

Depth interviews were held with local administrators, teachers of A.B.E., program counselors, and a random sampling of A.B.E. students. An oral questionnaire was used; and a Self-Study Questionnaire was sent in advance of a visit. The largest majority of students were married with families to support; the majority had completed eighth grade or further, yet were still semi-illiterate. One half had lived in Oregon more than six years. The greatest number of teachers had been employed in the program only one year but almost as many had been employed since the beginning (four years); most had not taught adults before. They felt a real need of training. The main  weakness of the program, as identified by teachers, was inadequate teaching materials, including inadequate tests; this might be partly due to lack of understanding of the new hardware and programed materials. Some very fine counseling was observed. The average cost per student this fiscal year was $115. The mean average reading score increased 1.6 grade levels this year; the cost to raise one student one grade level was $80. (PT)",

Basic questions pertained to whether such a typology could be developed, and whether other investigators and practitioners could use the typology and its elements with predictable results. In a pilot study, three program elements (objectives, interaction patterns, time) were formulated from an inductive analysis of 16 University of Chicago programs. This three-step process was later used to analyze 425 university continuing education programs and to sort them into 12 hierarchically arranged program types. Using a literature review and statistical procedures, the typology and  program elements were then evaluated (and found generally satisfactory) on the criteria of comprehensiveness, usefulness, consistency, and acceptance. Limitations of the study were noted, followed by implications of the typology for further research. (The Ph. D.

Nursing Home Association, these two series, each containing 84 hours of instruction in four three-day seminars, were designed to meet nursing home administrators' need for managerial skills and to prepare them for licensing. (Based on experiences with the first series, course materials and faculty were changed slightly in the second.) Preliminary conferences with 15 administrators showed favorable reactions to experience-based learning materials and discussion rather than passive learning. Seminars dealt, respectively, with planning and general concepts, leading and directing, measuring and controlling, and practical integration of knowledge and skills gained in the other seminars. One textbook (Leavitt's \"Managerial  Psychology\") and a manual of 15 readings, were used. Tuition per series was $460 for Association members, $560 for nonmembers. Certificates of participation went to 58 persons in all. The seminars were largely rated good or excellent. However, two of the seminars (mainly informational lectures) were not so well received, and participants would have liked more time spent on presentation. Based on findings, it was proposed that the curriculum be revised to include 112 hours of instruction, possibly in four seminars of 3 1/2 days each during each semester. (LY)",

Faculty members (largely university) were chosen for expertise, adult teaching ability, and rapport with policemen. The curriculum was divided between three weeks of management development and a one-week staff study workshop. Training techniques included lecture discussion, case studies, role playing, and other student involvement projects. Relatively unique aspects were tailor  made case materials resulting from initial organizational analysis, and pre- and postseminar assessments of attitudes and role perceptions. Participants enjoyed the program and felt they were learning; and it was determined that participants' job performance was notably enhanced.

        "description":"The first University of Maryland two week residential police instructor seminar on training (PIST)--a pilot project--was held during May 5-11 and May 26 through June 1, 1968; the second, incorporating changes arising from evaluation of the pilot project, was held April 27 through May 3 and May 25-29, 1969. Participants in the two programs numbered 21 and 17, respectively. In the first PIST, the instructors practiced various training techniques during both weeks. In the 1969 PIST, the first week was devoted to learning about techniques and their application, with the second week devoted almost wholly to practice exercises. The primary reason for this change of rationale was the need for preparation during the weeks between two halves. Greater emphasis in the 1969 PIST was placed  on developing the instructional ability of individuals, and on using small group discussion. Reading materials for both PIST seminars included Staton's &quot;How to Instruct Successfully,&quot; and a notebook of instructional materials and articles. The second seminar in particular was well received, and most particpants reported they had acquired new ideas and practices. Almost all participants agreed that the program should be extended to three or four weeks, including more time for practical application exercises. (LY)",

The study resulted from a concern about the increased number of students who did not complete the training during the year 1969. The procedure involved transfering student data from the school records to computer cards and preparing and analyzing both bivariate tables and a correlation table. These data when reviewed showed that over the five year period there was a definite change in the clientele. The following characteristics varied significantly; age, marital status, sponsorship, number of children, and final grade. It was found that the education and weight of the students were variables which seemed to be  related to student success. Significant correlations were found between the class number, age and final grade; between age, education, weight, final mark, and average child age; between height and weight; and finally between average child age and training before termination. Several weaknesses in research methodology were described. Recommendations for a study of student attitudes and the criteria used by the screening committee in selecting canidates were made. (PT)",

It has been shown that this difference is caused by the presence of underdetermined elements but not ordinary transformations. The effect of ordinary transformations in both modal and non-modal sentences is the same in both conditions. The possibility that the effective factor here is condition alone or underdeterminacy alone has been ruled out. Instead an interaction between condition and sentence type has been demonstrated. The demonstrated interactions was predicted from the nature of underdeterminacy. Underdetermined elements are any elements whose main function is to convey  information about the state of a speaker by injecting that information into an otherwise purely factual proposition. Hence, these elements should not have their real meaning in the absence of a speaker. Results from counting equivalent and non-equivalent substitutions along with other findings suggest that subjects in conventional tape experiments do not attend to sentence meaning to the same extent as do subjects in ordinary conversations. It may well be that earlier findings can be attributed to the unnatural importance of syntax in a tape experiment. (Author/AMM)",

        "description":"When sound takes on meaning for the first time in the life of a child, a giant and prototypic step in the development of his symbolic capacities has taken place. This step is worthy of careful scientific scrutiny. This paper seeks first to describe the steps by which the author's child discovered the existence of meaning in sound, and second, to describe the successive structurization and progressive refinement of this first word, as well as related lexical terms. It seems that once the predictive value of a word has been established by confirmatory events, it need not be retested each time the word appears. This is perhaps a first step towards the ability to make meaningful linguistic reference in the absence of a concrete, physical referent. This process, whereby language  becomes increasingly independent of external events, will be carried even further when words come to be combined in sentences. At that point the semantic burden begins to shift from situational to linguistic context in both comprehension and speech. The combinatorial possibilities inherent in sentence formation yield that creative productivity which is the hallmark of the later freedom of language from external control. Thus, there is a striking developmental shift from outer to inner control of understanding and speaking. [Not available in hard copy due to marginal legibility of original document.] (Author/AMM)",

In the centralized primary school system, with primary teacher-training directed towards state-controlled qualifying examinations, government policy now favors the teaching of Irish side by side with English (also an official language). With the establishing of the Linguistic Institute of Ireland, a linguist was commissioned to outline a procedure permitting the production of materials for teacher training and remedial work. When trained personnel are available, further work will proceed to improve guidance and materials for teaching English in Ireland. The urgency of the task of saving the Irish language from extinction has so far directed most activities in applied linguistics and  pedagogy toward improving the teaching of it as a second language in the greater part of the country where it has been superseded by English. &quot;Buntus Gaelige&quot; [Foundation-Beginnings in Irish], the results of the linguistic inquiry, is now officially presented throughout the entire school system with the aid of graded courses for the teaching of Irish as a subject from entry into primary schools up to the highest standard (4,500 primary schools outside the Irish-speaking areas).

The Yettem (California) School Project utilized the techniques of &quot;Visual Literacy&quot; and child-created materials. The children in this project, Mexican-American migrants who attend school part of each year in Mexico and part in  California, are third and fourth graders, divided into control groups who receive traditional ESL instruction one hour a day, and experimental groups who record experiences with cameras and tell stories, from which oral language drills and materials will be constructed. The final product will be a movie planned, produced, and filmed by the children, utilizing all the visual-verbal skills learned during the course of the project.

This article investigates briefly the causes of this situation and suggests a theoretical guideline--a scale of manipulation and communication teaching techniques which would allow for a gradual and orderly transition from activities that emphasize the development of basic linguistic skills to activities designed to encourage the free communication of thought. Communicative classroom activities are defined as those that allow the student to find the words and structures he uses. Manipulative activities are those in which the student receives the words and structures from teacher, tape, or  book. The movement from manipulation to communication does not have to be abrupt, and probably the shift should never be total, even in the most advanced classes. One result of the application of the scale, which would make use of Gurrey's classification of questions, might be a blurring of the sharp line separating language courses from literature courses.

This has led to a kind of language teaching that is fragmented, centering attention on the word as a crucial unifying link in the development of linguistic skills. We are now, however, in for a period of linguistic theory in which we will have to concentrate on how words are selected and recognized. This should lead to a renaissance in the teaching of  vocabulary. The pronunciation teacher should ask, \"What does the student have to know about pronunciation in order to recognize any word that he might ever hear?\" He has to be able to hear all of the necessary distinctive features of the language and know how words are made in terms of their pronunciation structure. The teacher should teach distinctive features rather than minimal pairs. The student recognizes a word by matching it up with what he hears. If he has been taught the sound system at the very beginning of his language learning, he will avoid misclassifying new words. (AMM)",

The sounds were intended to systematically explore the front-to-back place of articulation dimension while holding voice and manner constant. Five types of initial consonants were investigated in these studies: voiced stops, voiceless stops, voiceless (weak) fricatives, nasals, and liquid/semi-vowels. They were subjected to evaluation for \"naturalness\" by trained phoneticians and were presented to native speakers in an example word test. The general intelligibility and naturalness of the synthesized materials proved to be inadequate for the tasks in mind. As a consequence, no detailed results are given, and a re-emphasis on the research utility of speech synthesis systems is called  for. (Author/JD)",

These are: (1) the functions of higher education; (2) universal access or universal attendance; (3) the nature of the curriculum; (4) local versus regional colleges; (4) autonomy versus control; (5) who will pay; and (6) what access criteria should be used. The second part deals with some of the findings of a national study on the extent to which higher education is accessible to various populations. This study was based on a demographic analysis of all 2600 recognized institutions  in the US, and its findings indicated that about 3 in 10 were free access institutions, i.e., relatively inexpensive, admitted the majority of high school graduates, and presented no geographical or psychological barrier. Free access education was almost exclusively public, constituting 60% of the public sector and 1% of the private sector.

They were classified according to the type of 4-year college attended: public or private predominantly Negro colleges, or low, moderate or high selectivity predominantly white schools. There were marked differences among the students attending the different types of colleges in socioeconomic status, performance on a standardized test of educational development, and regional and high school background. The public Negro colleges tended to enroll those who were most disadvantaged, both economically and educationally, while students at the highly selective white  colleges tended to come from the most advantaged families and educational backgrounds. Overall freshman performance was quite high in all institutions, but students in the predominantly Negro colleges had higher grades than those in the predominantly white colleges. College type was also associated with the career choices and goals they expressed. (Author/AF)",

Higher tuition rates may be one of the answers, but this would exclude even more young people from attending college because of inability to pay, at a time when greater equality of opportunity in higher education has become an important goal. Federal support has helped but not alleviated the serious situation. The establishment of a Higher Education Loan Pool (HELP) could help both institutions and students. The Pool should be administered by a nonprofit, government-chartered corporation that would be authorized to make three types of loans: (1) contingent repayment loans to students up to $15,000, which the student would repay with a flat-rate personal income tax for 60 years after graduation, with the rate  related to the original amount borrowed; (2) fixed repayment loans to students which would be comparable to present National Defense Education Act loans, but more liberal; and (3) college facilities loans which would allow colleges to borrow the full cost of building facilities with repayment over 50 years. Since ability to pay seems to be a far more effective barrier to a college education than ability to learn, the contingent loans will especially help the poor and female students, who previously may have declined to borrow because of the heavy indebtedness incurred right after college, regardless of income earned.

The first impediment is the loss of overall graduate student support which will be sharply felt beginning in the fall of 1971. The Nixon Administration's program places a heavy emphasis on loans and persons from low income families are often reluctant to add to their debts accumulated from their undergraduate years. Another problem is that a relatively small number of black graduates apply to graduate school; many are siphoned off into industrial and business careers after graduation. A third barrier is the fact that black applicants tend to concentrate in a small number of fields: generally the humanities and social sciences, with almost no applications in the engineering field.  Given these factors, the criteria used for admissions must be examined. The validity of the usual predictors varies widely across different areas of study, and motivation may be more important than undergraduate grade point average. (AF)",

This study investigated whether a similar pattern of economic discrimination prevailed at Indiana University. Salaries were compared of men and women who had faculty or faculty-administrative appointments in December 1968, on the basis of: (1) type of appointment; (2) rank; (3) school in which the appointment was held; (4) level of education as measured by the highest degree held; and (5) professional experience as measured by the length of time an individual had taught at the University and the length of time to complete his or her education. The difference in gross monthly salaries between men and women was  $375.61, and, with all variables held constant, women could expect to earn about $100 per month less than a man. The difference in gross income is partly because women tend to held fewer advanced degrees, have lower academic ranks and fewer administrative appointments, and tend to teach in schools where average salaries are relatively low. The fact that women still earn $100 less per month suggests a systematic bias in the University's methods of determining individual salaries that works to the detriment of women. (AF)",

The test was administered to samples of students enrolled in the experimental program, alternates (students who had volunteered for the experimental program but were not selected) and students in the conventional curriculum. It was found that: experimental students viewed the college as less impulsive and more traditional than did other groups; they saw themselves, faculty, others and administrators as less traditional than did other groups; rated the college higher on sympathy and found it more non-directing. They saw themselves as more impulsive, liberal, egg-headed and rebellious than did other  students. They were more likely to drop out for academic reasons and less comfortable with other students. The conventional curriculum students saw everything and everybody as more disciplined, more personal and friendly. They viewed other students as more rebellious than themselves, and were most likely to drop out for nonacademic reasons. The alternates saw students as least disciplined, and other students and faculty as less sympathetic. They were most comfortable with other students, but least satisfied with the academic side of college life. (AF)",

FWC is committed to creating change agents to bring about a better world. It considers itself an agency for bringing students into contact with resources, and it considers the functions of its program to be less in the realm of supplying information and more in the realm of formation of character and achievement of direction and purpose. It is impossible to assess the College by conventional standards, because it is not a conventional institution. This report reviews the admission criteria, which includes the desire by the applicant to change the world; living accommodations (barracks about to be torn down); the educational program which demands the keeping of a journal  by the students; the living and work experience in foreign countries; the language program; accreditation and evaluation procedures; the financial situation, and the institution's governance.

        "description":"A review of the literature indicates that although some authors maintain that scholastic aptitude test scores of disadvantaged students are not clearly associated with college grades (Clark and Plotkin, 1963), most researchers have found the opposite to be true. Some selective institutions emphasize the disadvantaged student's persistence, rather than grades, but persistence alone is not a good measure of academic success. Many other institutions ignore test scores and concentrate on high school grades in admitting disadvantaged applicants, though there is ample evidence that grades alone are not a good predictor of academic success because of the differences in the quality of high school education. Aptitude test scores and high school grades, when used together, usually do  predict college grades of disadvantaged students about as well as they do for other students. Therefore, admission to selective colleges should be based substantially on test scores and high school grades, regardless of ethnic or socioeconomic background, and the gap between the academic promise of educationally disadvantaged applicants and the usual minimum demands of the institution should not be greater than explicit provisions for remediation, tutoring, coaching, and perhaps curriculum reform can bridge.

(2) What are the benefits of higher education to the individual and to society? (3) Can the outputs of higher education be named and measured? (4) Where is higher education going, where do we want it to go, and where does it need to go? Several issues were identified: (1) the summons to accountability by students, society, and the legislature; (2) flagging financial support; and (3) higher education's earlier overreaction to short-term needs. The papers in this publication deal generally with the problem of output. Papers by F. E. Balderston and John Vaizey survey the problem. The conceptual analysis of  output is dealt with by David G. Brown, C. West Churchman, Alain C. Enthoven, and Kenneth S. Tollett. Some approaches to measurement of output are suggested by Alexander W. Astin, John E. Brandt, Robbin R. Hough, and John P. Miller.

The first study was made to determine how students, faculty, and administrators perceive the effect of faculty research activity on instruction. Responses were obtained from 8,220 students, 336 faculty and 85 administrators for the pre-test, and 7,797 students, 361 faculty, and 78 administrators for the post-test. The findings were that students, faculty and administrators tended to agree strongly that research does affect the quality of teaching positively, and that research activity keeps a professor abreast in his field. In general, students and faculty exposed to research tended to be more positive toward research than other groups. The purpose of the  second study was to determine how presidents and Coordinating Council members perceived &quot;what is&quot; and &quot;what should be&quot; the situation at their institutions relative to research activity. The results indicated that both groups felt that research activity at their institutions relating to the Oklahoma Consortium on Research Development objectives had increased, but was still significantly less than it should be. Generally, the perceptions of all respondents regarding what should exist - while remaining positive - changed on the post-test to a more negative or realistic view. (AF)",

In the GSAS approximately the same percentage of female applicants is accepted as male applicants. The second section  discusses the reasons for reviewing the whole situation, and the third section suggests the formation and composition of a committee of the Faculty to study the status of women in the Faculty, the Graduate School, and the Administration. This section also raises policy question s that the committee should consider in terms of faculty recruitment and appointment, administrative hiring, and promotion practices, and admission policies, awarding of fellowships and teaching assistantships, and job recommendations in the Graduate School.

Yet the urban campus educates now more than one half of all college students. In design, the urban campus as a whole, and the union in particular, have followed the examples of their rural counterparts, without much attention to the needs of their urban environments. In addition to the traditional problems of the non-urban campus, the urban campus has a dropout rate of 60% - an indication that the education provided by these institutions is not suitable to many of their students. Parking is another serious problem that is often ignored. Because the library is often located far from any parking area, the union on an urban campus  should provide study facilities for students, as well as some space where new faculty members could temporarily do some of their work. One of the roles of the urban university should be to give meaning to urban life and assist in creating a new image for our cities. Just as the urban university must reexamine its purposes, so must the urban unions. (AF)",

The creation of cluster colleges is one example, as well as the creation of parallel colleges such as Radcliffe and Pembroke. A second technique is the device called \"election\" whereby students can choose from parallel competing courses. Parallelism is a popular device because it doesn't change existing programs, but it is not a technique for reforming the existing curriculum, except by undercutting it. The most pressing problem of curricular renewal is not the lack of new ideas, but the difficulty of getting these ideas implemented. A common technique of altering the curriculum has been to wait for a  faculty member to resign, retire or die. Another technique has been radical upheaval and reorganization. Several factors are important in effecting change; the most influential of which seems to be \"reward.\" This includes the need, motivation, market, incentive, pressure for and anticipated benefits of change. When curricular revision seems to be less threatening than the consequences of inaction, revision blossoms. Other factors are the institution's own orientation toward change and structure.

        "description":"The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine if a student's attitude toward his role as a rater of teacher behavior could be changed to become more positive as a result of his orientation to that role; (2) to determine if the choice of the student to continue to rate could be influenced; and (3) to determine if the inter-rate variability could be reduced and a more uniform frame of reference developed. An attitude scale concerning the role of students as raters of teacher behavior was developed and administered to two equal groups, randomly drawn from the Fall 1969 freshman class at Freed-Hardeman College. Three group counseling sessions were held to explain the purpose of rating, importance of student opinions efforts being made by the faculty to improve instruction, use  of the data collected and possible benefits to students which could occur as a result of their participation as raters. Findings indicated that the orientation did not significantly affect the student's attitude toward his role as a rater, nor his decision to continue as a rater. The control group was predominantly disposed toward rating, and hence there was no significant difference between the two groups on the choice of rating. (Author/AF)",

Eighty-nine Negro freshmen were randomly divided in 2 groups. One of these, the experimental group, was divided into 3 subgroups, each of which was assigned a counselor and provided with special tutoring and counseling for the entire first semester. The control group was given no special assistance. The results indicated that there were no significant differences  between the 2 groups in grade point averages, value changes, or number of students in the various categories, nor did the use of different counselors for the subgroups seem to make any difference. There was evidence, however, that Negro freshmen responded better to a Negro counselor than to either a male or female white counselor. (AF)",

The Deans and Assistant Deans of these schools were interviewed regarding the participation of women in their departments, in terms of involvement in honorary societies, scholarships awarded, placement services, dropouts, and specific fields chosen. There seemed to be no substantive proof of overt academic discrimination against women. The second study is a report of the Scholarships Awards Committee, which investigated the selection and granting of financial assistance to students.  The records indicated that women were awarded National Defense Student loans as often as men. The last study is an analysis of freshmen women responses in interviews on factors influencing their choice of a residence hall. The freshmen were given a preference card on which they could express their preference for one of four living plans: all women's halls with or without closing hours, and coeducational halls with or without closing hours.

Using a population of 305 male students who had resided and graduated from public schools in the same county, 195 were randomly selected for the study. These students--68 from a university and 46 liberal arts, 25 technical, and 56 business students from a nearby 2-year junior college--were given a variant (Bingham's Occupational Repertory Test) of the Modified Repertory Test, both at college entrance and 21 months later. Changes in self-esteem, level of incorporation of occupational concepts, and level of incorporation of social role concepts were noted. Statistical analysis of data suggests that: (1) preselection factors were operating in the students' initial program choice; (2)  2-year college students experienced a noticeable increase in self-esteem and identification with higher status occupations, making post-test differences in self-esteem between 4-year and 2-year college students insignificant; (3) the identification between 2-year college students enrolled in occupationally centered programs and their occupation was intensified; and (4) there was little change in the self-esteem or occupational identification of students completing their first two years of university experience. Based on these findings, the effects of the 2-year college environment are seen as particularly significant in developing occupational and self-concepts. (JO)",

One way to insure effective implementation of these concepts in the individual junior college--as envisioned by the Junior College Division of the Regional Education Laboratory for the Carolinas and Virginia--is through use of an Educational Development Officer (EDO). This individual would be trained to assist his institution in applying contemporary research methodologies and learning psychology to the instructional situation. Currently, the Regional Education Laboratory is training EDO's to: (1) aid the faculty in developing and specifying instructional objectives, (2) serve as measurement  consultants in constructing pre- and post-tests of student learning, (3) aid in the designing and subsequent revision of learning activities and teaching techniques, (4) conduct summative and formative evaluations of instructional programs, and (5) encourage research-based administrative decisions by evaluating their impact on student learning. As envisioned by the Laboratory, the EDO will function on the vice-presidential level within an institution, but his functions could be divided among existing staff members. In either case, the EDO's role is considered distinct and separate from that of the typical institutional research officer. (JO)",

Such a course is required for graduation at 42 per cent of the institutions; it typically receives three semester units of credit, meets 54 hours per term, and emphasizes public speaking. Development of a general facility in basic speech techniques appears to be the fundamental course objective. Types of speech receiving the greatest emphasis are those to inform, to persuade, and to demonstrate; however, impromptu speaking and discussions are also frequently mentioned. Course requirements usually encompass seven to eight major speeches, a few quizzes, reports on speeches and  lectures, and out-of-class written assignments. Most instructors prefer an informal rather than a standardized grading form, and 93 per cent report no use of the \"normal curve\" in grade assignment. About 60 per cent of class time is used for speech presentation, and about 20 per cent for criticism. Most instructors report current use of voice recordings for student skill development, with many indicating future plans to use videotape. Based on these and other findings of the report, it is concluded that, while similarities and diversities in approach are apparent, follow-up study is needed to spot trends, new developments, and successful innovative techniques.

Differences between group means on each CUES scale were determined by analysis of variance (t ratio), and tests of significance (F ratio) were applied. Looking at the results, males and females recorded the greatest differences on the awareness and practicality scales, and the greatest similarities on the community and scholarship scales. Within the groups, the greatest spread of scores was noted on the community and propriety scales. Using .05 as the level of  significance, only on the awareness scale did the females differ significantly from the males. Strong agreement was noted on the scholarship and community scales. Interestingly, no significant differences among the groups were indicated at the .05 level. Trends indicated by the t ratio show rural commuters perceiving the most and resident students the least emphasis on practicality at their college. In addition, the resident students perceived less emphasis on community than the other groups. A greater contrast between resident and city commuter students was noted on community, propriety, and scholarship than between resident and rural commuter groups. (JO)",

A stressful situation was defined as any one that causes the student to be concerned, anxious, or uncomfortable. Respondents were to indicate for each of 25 items whether certain situations caused them great, moderate, little, or no stress. Results were reported for the following subgroups of urban and rural students: male, female, transfer, and vocational-technical. Urban subgroup respondents were more consistent than the rural subgroup in their ratings of the highest and lowest stress-producing situations. Significant differences at the .05 level were indicated for the following situations, using the Chi-square test: impersonality of college  life, Vietnam war, loneliness, lack of student representation on college committees, and pressure from too many responsibilities. Urban students indicated significantly greater degrees of stress resulting from the first two, and rural students indicated significantly greater degrees of stress resulting from the last three. Contradictions between stated college teaching practices and what actually goes on in the classroom produced significantly more stress for rural transfer students than for urban transfer students. In conclusion, it should be noted that urban students were more concerned with national problems (Vietnam war, draft) compared with the more local concerns of rural students (loneliness, pressure).

Recognizing these facts, this monograph looks at the orientation program as one solution. Recent research on faculty background in terms of occupational and teaching experiences, occupational attitudes, and academic credentials reveals the great variation at both the state and national level. This variation, when considered with the diverse recruiting methods and environments, adds immediacy to the need for programs that can begin the unification process and obtain support for each institution's locally prescribed mission. A review of orientation programs in California, Michigan, and  New York characterizes recent approaches to this situation. Related research on the planning, conduct, and activities of individual programs, as well as their regional distribution, offer additional insight. Characteristics of existing programs that appear important include participation of incumbent faculty members, and introduction to real problems faced by each institution. After considering this research, a model for a new orientation program is suggested, including discussion of goals, planning, duration, actual conduct, and evaluation. The concluding section investigates future circumstances which should be considered in developing orientation programs. (JO)",

Six of the responding districts indicated assignment of faculty rank. The median of the maximum percentages of staff who may be authorized for sabbatical leave was 4.5, with a median salary of 100 per cent of a regular instructor's salary for one semester and 50 per cent if the leave is longer. The most common  compensation for division or department heads was a teaching-load reduction, with some additional pay. Provision for secretarial assistance varied widely, depending on the district. No identifiable basic pay pattern was evident for paying regular instructors for summer teaching. The most frequent limitation on full-time instructors teaching beyond their normal load was six additional hours per week.

From these two questionnaires, data concerning attitudinal shifts, job changes, and employment and persistence ratios were collected. The Chi-square test for significant differences failed to reveal any at the .05 level between minority, nonminority groups, or individual ethnic groups on: (1) rate of employment, (2) rate of employment in jobs related to the  college programs completed, or (3) number of students who changed jobs during their first year of employment. Apparently, the local community's employment practices showed no evidence of differential treatment. This test also indicated no significant differences between ethnic groups in mean beginning salaries or attitude toward college atmosphere, counselors, courses, instruction, or instructors. Another indication of the colleges' success was the fact that 92 per cent of their graduates in this sample were employed full-time. (JO)",

        "description":"A comparison of two groups of urban area junior college transfer students who attended local urban campuses of the University of Missouri and of two other groups who transferred to the Columbia branch of the University of Missouri was the subject of this study. The comparison was made in regard to the question of whether or not urban area junior college transfer students who attended the Columbia branch of the University of Missouri experienced a greater drop in Grade Point Average (GPA) than did transfers who attended the two local urban campuses. The null hypothesis was tested using GPA's. Means and standard deviations were also computed for pooled junior college and first semester University of Missouri GPA's. Data showed that &quot;transfer shock&quot; was equally intense at all three  campuses. Consequently, the author concluded that most urban area junior college students will experience &quot;transfer shock&quot; and that it would be worthwhile for colleges to offer an orientation program for prospective transfer students to inform them of an expected drop in GPA and to impress upon them that a drop in GPA is a normal occurrence among junior college transfer students.

While attempts to compare this year's results with last year's can be considered premature, some findings may be of interest. During the preceding 9-month period, over 700 hours of service were provided. This includes individual and small group counseling for 150 people. Of these 150, approximately 50 per cent had an annual family income of $4000 or less, and over half had left high school by the eleventh grade. Sixty-five per cent of the 150 were also either too young to work, or experienced employment difficulties due to a lack of education. Of these,  29 per cent were subsequently placed in college, 11 per cent in job training, and 30 per cent referred to other agencies for counseling or job placement. Of those not placed, many had come to the center only for information, and could not have been placed anyway. A questionnaire completed by 80 counselees indicated that 80 per cent came to the counseling center to receive college or career planning information, 93 per cent felt they were helped there, and 100 per cent would not only use the center again, but would also recommend that their friends use it.

In regard to these problems, suggestions made by several professionals in the junior college field for in-service faculty improvement are presented. In reviewing their suggestions for faculty development programs, the author concludes that criteria to measure the effectiveness of such programs must assess the resultant change in student learning. Criteria suggested for such assessment stress clear goals, careful planning, the extent of institutional and individual change, accurate cost accounting, and effective communication of results. Major obstacles to achieving effective programs are seen as lack of time and money, faculty apathy,  lack of communication with the administration, and poor planning of programs. (RC)",

Initial planning activities and months required to accomplish them are summarized, along with the various methods by which new institutions acquired facilities to begin instruction. In addition, a sequence of typical campus planning activities was developed which schematically indicates these events from their initiation to the &quot;working drawings&quot; stage. Major areas of planning are reviewed, including academic, fiscal, and physical. Site selection studies involved local boards operating in accordance with state department of education criteria. Sites were obtained as grants or gifts from individuals or government  agencies. Long range space needs were established through the use of facilities surveys, and--in some cases--through the development of educational specifications dealing with the purposes, teaching methods, building requirements, and equipment needs of each curriculum area. Campus development plans were discussed and classified according to three general typologies: &quot;lineal,&quot;&quot;collegial,&quot; and &quot;compact.&quot; In concluding this study, several key factors in good campus planning were identified, including interagency coordination, adequate sites and funding, the use of one architectural firm throughout, good enrollment projections, and comprehensive educational specifications.

Of the 185 schools originally contacted, 42 specifically indicated no such program, and only six questioned their appropriateness. The most often indicated reasons for the existance of remedial programs were to enable students to continue in regular college math, or to satisfy prerequisite requirements for some other non-mathematics courses. Basic algebra, intermediate algebra, arithmetic, and Euclidean geometry were the courses most frequently offered. In selecting students for remedial programs, standardized tests, previous grades, and counselor recommendation were the most often used criteria. Enrollment in remedial  courses included at least 20 per cent of all mathematics students at 51 of the schools. Enrollment in subsequent math courses by continuing students reached an average per cent of 39.4 in 51 of the colleges. Entrance into these non-remedial courses was based largely on grades of C or D in the remedial course. More than half the faculty in each school was involved in the programs, and the major bases for selection included rotation, interest, and understanding of the underachiever. Only 26 of the respondents indicated efforts to evaluate their program. (JO)",

Because the selection of books for inclusion in a library collection requires an intimate understanding of the purpose of the library, a detailed knowledge of the subject area in question, time to read and make judgements about the value of any particular volume, and finally, the authority to develop the collections, librarians in university libraries are in trouble today. A brief look at the evolution of this problem of who should select and acquire books for the library collection is presented with numerous quotes from authorities in the field starting with Richard DeBury in the 13th century. It must be decided whether the range of duties required of a subject  specialist/selector can effectively be done separately by various people or whether this job requires extremely competent people with broad, non-library preparation.

Part of the study was devoted to a literature search on the subject of book selection for academic libraries. Two main trends represented in the literature were: (1) It is the duty of the teaching faculty to do the book selection for academic libraries; and (2) Collection development is one of the prime responsibilities of academic librarians. The majority of the librarians and administrators questioned during this study felt that book selection should be a joint responsibility of faculty and librarians. The majority of the faculty felt it  should be their own right and responsibility. The large extent to which libraries use \"blanket order\" (an agreement between a library and an agent or publisher to purchase all of a certain set of publications) and \"approval order\" (volumes sent a library are \"on approval\" and any not wanted may be returned) plans was the nearest thing to a fresh insight received from the data. The blanket and approval orders are shown to be important in the acquisitions of even moderate sized academic libraries. Most librarians and faculty are favorably impressed. (NH)",

Now we can begin to see duplicated information rising with increasing distinctness as an ancillary problem that deserves more attention. Librarians have more money than time to evaluate individual purchases and do not stand back at purchasing duplicated information if a  publisher packages it with significant new information. Publishers, library budgets and book collections would benefit if better guidelines for distinguishing justifiable from unjustifiable duplication were developed. To determine whether an attractive new package of information effectively rounds out, or materially duplicates, information already present in a sizable collection requires in-depth, expert attention that book-reviewing machinery is poorly organized to provide. More work needs to be done of the problem. This study is exploratory and the results are fragmentary. (NH)",

A full description of the original plan was published in 1954 (out of print). This publication is a supplement to the earlier manual which brings the policy statement up to date. Its main purpose is to ad students in library practice at the Laboratory School. It outlines the main features of the system, indicates types of media not originally included, and illustrates, through sample cards, solutions to cataloging problems encountered since 1954. Suggestions for further simplifications in  cataloging suitable for publi schools are also given. The main topics covered include: (1) basic aims of the plan of organization, (2) devices used to achieve the aims, (3) sample call numbers, (4) description of the organization of the various types of nonbook materials, (5) temporary-slip forms for circulation and acquisition, (6) adapted and simplified catalog-card form, (7) basic card-form variations, (8) shelf card, (9) sample shelf-list and catalog cards, and (10) addenda.

        "description":"The theory of behavioral instructional objectives is applicable in the design of library administration courses; however, it does give rise to a number of problems when so applied. Chief among these is that the theory of behavioral instructional objectives has been elaborated by pedagogues so that the theory is not, understandably, uniformly applicable to adult education. The twofold purpose of this report is to bridge the communication gap between educational researchers and those at work designing library administration courses for the continuing education of librarians, and to discuss the problems that arise when educational research findings are applied to library education. It was concluded that the application of the theory of behavioral instructional objectives to adult  leaners by those developing graduate library administration courses might lead to a significant modification and broadening of the scope of the theory as it now stands. Moreover, the field of library education stands to benefit from the application of the theory to library administration courses by stimulating the production of highly valuable teaching materials such as case studies and simulation studies.

Table I indicates that less than 20% of the faculty are at the lowest rank of instructor while 50% of the librarians are classified in the basic  rank. Many librarians will never advance beyond this position and most of those who do will go no higher than department head or branch librarian. On the other hand, approximately 50% of the faculty hold the two highest ranks--professor and associate professor. Three factors seem to exert a strong effect on librarians' compensation: (1) predominance of women in the profession. (2) large number of routine and clerical tasks performed, and (3) prevailing departmental organization which acts as a barrier to nonadministrative librarians. (NH)",

The network proposed is constructed of groups of libraries and information centers operating as a consortium without limitation on the nature of their local jurisdictions.

Using one class of second and one class of fourth graders as control groups and one class of second and another class of fourth graders as experimental groups, a unit of civic instruction was taught during the 2-week period before a national election. The experimental groups received formal instruction in political concepts over a 3-week period and engaged in concept-related role playing activities. All children were given structured interviews before and after the period of instruction; these results were coded. Pre- and post-tests were the Science Research Associates achievement and primary abilities tests. Interview results showed that all  groups increased in the average level of political concept-attainment during the election period, but the experimental groups increased more rapidly even when initial levels of political concept attainment and general school achievement were held constant. It is suggested that the young child is capable of understanding more about the political realm than is generally assumed and that school political instruction could profitably begin earlier than it normally does. Appendixes describe concepts, interviews, and changes in political conceptualization. (Author/DR)",

Children randomly selected from both programs were tested on a variety of measures in October and May. Data were collected on such independent variables as school poverty index (percent of families on welfare), chronological age, number of siblings, ordinal rank of child in family, and school year attendance. Two statistical measures were used: Stepdown Regression Analysis and Analysis of  Covariance. Results indicated (1) direct instructional strategy was more effective than enrichment in fostering basic academic skills, (2) effect of preschool experience one year later was limited to reading scores only, and (3) pretest scores were the best predictors of children's performance on posttests of general mental functioning and basic skills.

The Early Childhood Education Learning System is an instructional program which includes staff development and parent-school-community involvement. Focus is on the special learning problems of Mexican-American children and the development of bilingual competence. A total of 98 3- and 4-year-old migrant children participated during 1968-1969. Program evaluation is viewed as a continuing process. Part of this evaluation was a pre- and post-testing on the Preschool Attainment Record (PAR) of 2 groups of children, a migrant group from the Early Childhood Education system and a non-migrant group from regular day care centers. On the pretest, the non-migrant  children scored higher. However, the posttest showed that the children in the experimental program made greater developmental gains than the other children. Children whose teachers had high scores on the Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory performed better on the PAR than students whose teachers had low scores. Parents who participated in the parent activities scored higher on an educational attitude scale than non-participating parents. (MH)",

The basic hypothesis is that social class is related to the width of the range; that is, the lower the social class level the wider the range of aspiration. Interviews were conducted with parents of 255 Negro kindergarten and pre-school children, representing both lower class and middle class backgrounds. The criterion for selection as lower class was that neither parent had gone beyond high school in his education; for middle class, that both parents had finished high school and at least one parent had gone beyond high school. The hypothesis was supported for both educational and occupational aspirations, using a variety of operational measures. To the extent  that lower class parents have a wider range of aspirations, with a peak as high as the middle class peak, there is a built-in potential for mobility. To encourage mobility it is important to provide opportunities and to establish a conviction of their attainability. This document is an expanded version of ED 030 482. (Author/NH)",

In kindergarten and grade one, the majority of children in this longitudinal study were between preoperational and the achievement stage of operational thought. By grade two, the majority had attained the terminal stage on seven of nine tests given. By grade three, the children achieved terminal stages on all tests. Over a 3-year period only eight true regressions occurred. This number constituted less than one percent of the total possible regressions. Both the Piaget test scores and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children measures were slightly higher for the regressing children. In this study, &quot;regressing children&quot; were not less  intelligent than nonregressing children. However, the numbers were too small to warrant any conclusions. (WY)",

Apprehension span (perception and transformation of aural or visual inputs leading up to reconstruction or verbal description output) was measured. A specially designed form board varying on three binary dimensions and thirty-two plastic geometric shapes varying on five binary dimensions was the basic test material to which a subject responded by either describing or reconstructing a given stimulus design. Scores were calculated on the basis of match between the reference subset of shapes and  the form board performance. A 3 x 2 x 2 complete factorial design was used. Results indicate that there is a differential decrease in differences in the apprehension span of children with development. Correlations between the total of eight apprehension span tasks and the Primary Mental Abilities Test support the conclusion that information is processed through the non-verbal mode and bottlenecks in a child's processing of information are mainly those involving translation into and out of another medium such as language.

Initial statistical tests failed to show differences that could be reliably interpreted as developmental retardation. Further analysis involved a pilot study in which dietary intervention produced an improvement in blood levels for the most deficient subgroup. No generalizations can be made until subsequent analysis (1) resolves  issues raised by age, (2) controls for initial lack of equivalence in intervention groups, and (3) examines individual differences in nutrition and behavior profiles.

Two groups of ten mothers each met weekly with two staff members over an 8-month period and were trained to tutor their infants (1 to 2-years-old) in their homes. Fifteen of the initial 20 mothers remained in the program a second year. The program included: (1) training mothers to use educational toys and materials to stimulate their children's learning in sensory-motor, concept, and language development; (2) discussion of child-rearing problems; (3) fostering attitude change through sharing ideas; and (4) helping the mothers to develop self-confidence and responsibility. Regular home visits were made by staff members to observe mothers working with  their babies and to make helpful suggestions. The implementation section of this report describes recruitment of mothers and selection of educational materials. Also given is an account of the weekly meetings which emphasized verbal interaction and involvement of the group and their leader. At the end of the training period each mother completed a questionnaire evaluating the program. Both these evaluations and staff judgments indicated that the program was successful in meeting its objectives. (NH)",

Subjects were a girl who showed a very high amount of isolate behavior, and a boy who usually played alone, or with girls to the exclusion of boys. Data were collected for one month during half hour periods on subjects' isolate, parallel, and interactive behavior. Interactions of teachers with the subjects were recorded and classified as positive, neutral, or directive. For four days distributed throughout the study, data identical to that on the subjects were collected on the rest of the class to provide norms. Treatment programs planned for the two children involved teacher attention (positive or neutral), contingent on parallel or  interactive play. For the boy, isolate play and play with girls was to be ignored; for the girl, isolate play was to be ignored. During treatment, these behaviors showed significant decreases. Extinction and reintroduction of the reinforcement programs were instituted to demonstrate their control over the subjects' social behavior. Teacher reinforcement was evidently the crucial variable factor as subjects' parallel and interactive play decreased during the extinction period. (NH)",

An earlier study (1957) of American Indian children living on a reservation provided the stimulus for this research. The subjects were 93 white, 6-year-old boys and girls. Of this number, 34 were from a disadvantaged, rural background and 59 from a middle class, urban background. The subjects in both groups were shown five cards with photographs of human figures whose activity and emotion were ambiguous, and the verbal responses of each child were written down as he talked about them. The percentage of the children in the two groups using  positive words was relatively similar. However, the percentage of disadvantaged children using negative words such as &quot;fight,&quot;&quot;mad,&quot;&quot;sad,&quot; and &quot;scold,&quot; was more than twice as great as the percentage of advantaged children using negative words. The tendency to perceive non-threatening or neutral stimuli as hostile, if persisting to adulthood, may adversely affect both the individual and society, and should be taken into account when planning ameliorative educational programs.

The two environments were presented randomly to one group of 10 4-year-olds, five of each sex, on 12 consecutive 15-minute play sessions, with the stipulation that each environment be presented six times. There was no pre-experimental familiarization period due to information, later proven incorrect, that the subjects were adequately familiar with all the play apparatus. Results indicate that the high-level aggression in the first two LO sessions is solely responsible for the significant difference between the aggression in  the LO versus the HO environments. Anecdotal records indicate that this high-level aggression can be attributed to a novel piece of equipment, a rocker, resulting in a recommendation for further study of the relation between novelty and aggression. The discussion identifies some factors relevant in the aggression education of young children. The design of similar studies using subjects who would presumably exhibit high-level aggression in high-opportunity environments is recommended. (Author/NH)",

Analysis of the data suggests that factors influencing play are so complex that present attempts at predicting group activity trends may be premature. Further work is needed in the definition and isolation of stimulus parameters of the physical environment so that the interpretation of play behavior is simplified and made more relevant for the individual child. It is suggested that individual trends must be investigated before a complete  understanding of group play patterns can be achieved. (Author/NH)",

Parents' questionnaire responses were analyzed in terms of the complexity, novelty, autonomy, and explorativeness of the home play environment. Parents' levels of conceptual development were than compared on the questionnaire responses and the children's performance scores. The results for fathers showed no significant differences. The results  for mothers indicated that more abstract mothers had more positive attitudes toward and were more likely than more concrete mothers to provide complex, novel, autonomous, and explorative play situations for their children. The children of more abstract mothers also showed more complex and varied behavior on the preformance task. These results were unrelated to differences among parents on certain demographic variables--age, income, education, and occupational prestige.

Visual or auditory stimuli are presented to the infant and his response behavior is recorded. Two dependent variables measured have been first fixation (the length of the infant's first visual fixation to the stimulus during any single presentation), and cardiac deceleration (the degree to which the infant's heart rate slows  during a fixation). Past studies are cited regarding their differing emphases on particular aspects of attention and their findings on individual differences. Typically, the infant habituates (responds less) to repeated presentations of stimuli. Work in this area is just beginning, but study results thus far indicate that habituation and response to discrepancy may be important indices of cognitive functioning. (NH)",

Premature infants from a range of socioeconomic groups were studied in five rounds over 13 years to provide neurological, psychological, achievement, and sociological data on 582 children in three birth weight groups. A summary based on the final round makes these points: (1) Birth weight is related to reading and arithmetic achievement when social class and race are controlled, (2) Birth weight remains a significant correlate when an attempt is made to control for neurological status (estimated at age 40 weeks), (3) The correlation between indices of mental development and late adolescent intellectual behavior approaches zero, (4) Arithmetic is  apparently more sensitive as an indicator of impairment due to birth weight than is reading, (5) None of the statistical interactions between race, social class, birth weight, and achievement were significant.

Children witnessed an adult female practice either charitable or selfish behavior. One-third of the subjects in each group heard the model exhort either charity or greed or verbalize normatively neutral material. Following this exposure, half the children within each group received social reinforcements from the model for responses minimizing material rewards, while the other half obtained no social rewards. An interaction of model's practices, preachings and social reinforcements was found: the model who practiced and preached charity and rewarded self-denial responses elicited the greatest number of such responses from the children. The model who preached and practiced charity but  did not reward it, elicited the least number of the responses. Children's judgments of the model's niceness were determined by the model's preachings and practices, not by the rewards. (Author)",

Chapter 2 gives an account of data collection during the current year of the study, when the children were first enrolled in Head Start classes. The study design calls for two lines of investigation: follow-up of the longitudinal sample, and study of appropriate cross-sectional groups (kindergarten through grade 3). The Personal Record of School Experience (PROSE) and the Classroom Observational  Rating Scale (Personality) were used throughout the program year to record the children's relationships with peers, teachers, and classroom materials. The children were tested also on a variety of measures of mental, motor, and personality development. Additional data were collected from parent interviews and classroom observations. Teacher and school administrator questionnaires are in preparation. The cross-sectional study had not been done at the time of this report. (NH)",

Children's accuracy in determining the older of the two figures on each stimulus card increased steadily over the seven age levels.

The present study compares test scores of the Complete Assessment Battery administered before the children entered kindergarten with scores of the same children on the Metropolitan Readiness Tests at the end of kindergarten and on the Stanford Achievement Test at the end of the first primary year. Test scores of 48 boys and 55 girls were combined as age and sex differences in readiness and achievement were not statistically significant. Whole and part test scores were treated separately. The Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities, Language Quotient (ITPA-IQ) proved to be a reasonably good predictor of performance on the  Metropolitan Readiness Tests, and predictability was increased by using only three ITPA subtests and the test of Visual-Motor Integration (MVI) instead of the whole ITPA battery. Performance on the Stanford Achievement Test could be predicted best by using one ITPA subtest (Auditory-Vocal Association) and the test of VMI. Throughout the study, ITPA-3 proved to be the best single predictor. (Author/NH)",

Part I discussed ways in which communities obtain day care facilities, concentrating on changes in community opinion and environment which influence the existence of day care centers. Part II focuses on the decision-making process with regard to the background of problems met in setting up community day care. The role of money as a great facilitator is emphasized throughout the report. Licensing, standards, and staffing of day care facilities are examined. However, communities should recognize that idealized standards do not, in themselves, promote quality. Rather, committed leaders who can find a responsive environment for quality day care  programs are vitally important. How the leadership network came into being and how it operates to promote its concerns is discussed. A consideration of issues bearing on the future of day care concludes the report.

Subjects were 108 white, middle class, 4-year-olds enrolled in a nursery school. Each teacher tested the children in her class to determine their understanding of relational words and their ability to follow individual directions. Study results showed no significant difference between scores of children asked to follow a verbal command and those asked to follow directions given by demonstration. A second study investigated children's ability to follow either novel or additive sequential directions. There were 30 children in each group. It was found that  children could handle significantly more directions in the additive condition than in the novel. A replication-extension of this study (40 subjects) showed that use of incentive did not increase the number of directions remembered. In another study, conditional directions scaled from easy to difficult were used and more than one-half the subjects successfully completed all of the conditional directions. A map study involving the need to follow symbolic code directions showed that children were able to use the code when the transfer of the code to the real life environment was fairly obvious. (NH)",

The following parameters of early childhood education are proposed and explored: (a) characteristics of clients, (b) characteristics of teachers and assisting adults, (c) curriculum, (d) philosophical orientation and historical factors, (e) parent power, (f) administrative factors and sponsorship, (g) length of program, and (h) physical plant and climate. A matrix is generated from these parameters, in order to demonstrate that early childhood education is a complex field deserving of extensive analysis. The focus today seems to be either on characteristics of clients or on program  organization, with the assumption that packaged early childhood education programs may be used in situations which are not analagous, with positive results. Although these two parameters are of major importance, it is emphasized that an increased understanding of all the parameters of early childhood education, and the ways in which they interact and influence each other, may make it more possible to successfully translate theory into practice.

A case study design which relied heavily on historical methodology was employed to explore the articulation, processing, and implementation of demands. Collection and analysis of documents and interviews were the major research methods used. The pre-Sputnik era (1945-57) featured educational demands by &quot;technocrats&quot; which produced no educational response. The Sputnik era (1957-58) legitimized those demands and resulted in greater curricular emphasis on science,  math, and college preparatory programs. The post-Sputnik calm (1959-62) resulted in a reduction in political activity, educational demands, and curricular responses since demands had been substantially met during the previous period. The period of reaction (1963-65) emphasized compensatory and vocational education for the disadvantaged, and this was supported even by the technocrats. (JH)",

        "description":"The report is on the socioeconomic condition of rural people within a selected area in the United States. The information was provided by 1,413 sample households in the rural areas of 125 counties in the Ozarks region of Arkansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma. The study included Whites, Indians, and Negroes within the region. Based on household size and income in 1965, 25% of the households were considered seriously deprived. Based on income alone, 44% were considered deprived, having earned less than $3,000. The people studied were grouped into 5 classes based on household size and income: (1) seriously deprived, (2) deprived, (3) marginal, (4) probably not deprived, and (5) definitely not deprived. The major characteristics associated with deprivation included advanced age, being the  female head of a household, low levels of education, marginal farming, and physical disabilities. Sixty percent of the people with children at home stated that, in their judgement, their children would need to finish college. Because most household incomes are so low, a major tragedy in the Ozarks region may be the financial inability to support youngsters in reaching desired educational levels. (EJ)",

        "description":"Rural education is described in this paper in terms of its progress and problems. Among the problems, it is noted that money available on a competitive basis is generally out of reach of the rural school because of the lack of time and talent needed to obtain the funds. Teachers are often undertrained, holding \"Life Certificates\" earned with less than 4 years of college. Special services such as guidance programs and hot lunch programs are lacking because funds are not available to support them. Course offerings are limited due not only to class size but also to what the teachers who are employed can teach. Vocational education as related to fields other than agriculture does not exist, and 9 out of 10 students leave the farm without the training needed for employment in the city  since course offerings serve only the college-bound student. However, some trends are described which hold promise for the rural youth. The number of 1-room schools is declining. Regional service centers or intermediate units are becoming new resources to rural areas, providing services such as diagnostic clinical facilities and specialized personnel. Ways to expand innovative programs in rural schools, as well as new programs designed for nonurban schools, are also discussed. (LS)",

        "description":"Many educational problems center around vocational education--its place in the total educational program, its relation to academic education, when vocational education should be started, and who should participate. Vocational education, the alternative to college preparatory programs, is frequently rejected and more often misunderstood by administrators and consumers of American education. Present-day technology has created a new relationship between man, his work, and his education. There is ample evidence that all persons who work need more education than they have had in the past; yet it appears that our present educational system is not preparing them adequately for many kinds of occupations. The major effort in education is given to programs that lead to a baccalaureate  degree. This is done despite the fact that, of approximately 58 million students enrolled in educational institutions, well over 40 million of them will not graduate from college. A major problem today is how to assist small high schools so that they can have adequate programs of vocational education. The document includes discussion of a program entitled &quot;Proposed Organization of Courses in Vocational Education Programs for Small High Schools.&quot; (EJ)",

        "description":"This document, a part of the final report of the National Study of American Indian Education, examines Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) boarding schools, of which there are 77 among the 226 BIA schools in 17 states. The document concerns itself with the history, value of, and necessity for boarding schools in general. It is pointed out that, in 1969, there were 34,600 Indian children enrolled in BIA boarding schools; 15,450 more in BIA day schools; and 3,850 housed in peripheral dormitories while attending public schools. It is also noted that enrollment in BIA boarding high schools doubled during the period between 1959 and 1967. The document reviews briefly the history of Indian education, with particular emphasis on the boarding school since its beginning at Carlisle Indian  School in 1878. Educational programs administered to the Indians by the U.S. Government dating back to 1776 are discussed. Recommendations for the administration of Indian education, along with the Indian point of view regarding boarding schools and education in general, are included. The bibliography lists 63 references. (EL)",

It is noted that, in the past, Indians in isolated communities and in the cities have suffered from poverty. As reported, the discrimination which affects the Indians is compounded with a legal status which sets them apart from the main society; therefore, the government of Canada is seeking a partnership among the Indians, the governments of provinces, the communities, and the Canadian government to achieve equality for the Indians through cooperation. The historical background of the Indian problem, which is said to press heavily on the  Indian people, is discussed as well as the recommendation for a new policy toward the Indians. The new policy is directed at such tasks as removing legislative and constitutional bases of discrimination, promoting recognition of the unique contribution of Indian culture to Canadian society, and transferring control of Indian lands to Indian people.

One of the purposes of this study was to attempt to identify individual and cultural differences in the use of alcohol which might exist between urban Indian, White, and Negro subcultures in Minneapolis. The data gathered from Municipal Court, the Minneapolis Department of Public Relief, Pioneer House Evaluation Center, and the Minneapolis Work House indicate that at least the aspect of drinking which comes to public attention exists disproportionately in the Minneapolis Indian population. Approximately 2% of the city's population is Indian, but of the average 156 drunk arrests per week in 1969, one-third were made on  Indians.

Major findings were that (1) educational attainment of migrant children was positively and significantly related to the head's SES and to the father's educational need, defined as his perceptions of the level of educational attainment needed (not wanted or expected) by his children for &quot;getting ahead in the world&quot; and (2) intergenerational occupational mobility of migrant children was positively and significantly related to the head's SES but only positively  related to educational need. The study also found (1) a weak positive relationship between the head's SES and the occupational expectations of youth; (2) a weak positive but significant relationship between the head's SES and occupational aspirations of youth; (3) a strong positive and significant relationship between the head's SES and the educational expectations of youth; and (4) a strong positive and significant relationship between the head's SES and educational need. Results of this study indicate the potential fruitfulness of viewing facilitating valuation and educational need as concepts supplementing the concepts of aspiration and expectation. (Author/AL)",

All 3 programs had the general goal of changing and improving attitudes and self-concepts of rural mountain children. The programs, funded under Title III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, were evaluated by faculty members from Tennessee universities. Teachers participating in the human relations inservice program scored higher on a measure of self-actualization, displayed a higher degree of interpersonal thinking, and were more change-oriented than nonparticipating teachers. Children in the cultural  arts program showed a tendency toward increase originality and the ability to elaborate on an idea. Both elementary and junior high counseling programs received positive feedback from children and teachers and were credited with improving school morale. The dropout rate for junior high school students participating in the counseling program decreased significantly. One of the project's greatest contributions was to demonstrate that new programs could be staffed with local personnel and could be carried on in existing, often inadequate, facilities without unreasonable demands on local systems for materials and supplies.

The migrant labor forces are made up of Mexicans, Negroes, and Whites living under conditions characterized by poor housing, bad sanitation, poor diets, and inadequate medical care. In a very real sense the migrant farmers form a \"subculture,\" living  apart from the rest of the nation in many ways. They not only live apart, but they feel the implications of their behavior.

It is noted that 73% of the Indians spoke Papago in the home and that the average of 8 years of formal education also limited English-speaking ability. Low educational attainment and lack of English language skills made it difficult for the Papago to compete for the jobs existing in the area. The male labor force reached a peak in the 30-39 age group, with a decline starting after age 40. Withdrawal from the labor force among women was greatest in the 30-39 age group. Some 38% of the  Papagos of working age listed family responsibilities as their reason for not seeking off-reservation employment, while the reservation had an unemployment rate 3 times greater than the rest of Arizona's unemployment rate. Income was low, with 92% of the individuals receiving less than $3000 per year. Some 85% of the families, which averaged 6 members, received under $5000 annually. Since 64% of the families did not own cars, transportation presented another problem for the unemployed seeking employment off the reservation. (LS)",

        "description":"A study was made of nine reading tests, including both group and individually-administered measures, which are claimed to be chiefly diagnostic. Instruments analyzed were the following: Silent Reading Diagnostic Tests (Bond, Balow, and Hoyt), Botel Reading Inventory, Durrell Analysis of Reading Difficulty, Gates-McKillop Reading Diagnostic Tests, McCullough Word Analysis Tests, Roswell-Chall Diagnostic Reading Tests, Diagnostic Reading Scales (Spache), and Levels I and II of the Stanford Diagnostic Reading Test. Examination of the nine diagnostic batteries revealed subtests for (1) measuring potential reading level, (2) measuring silent and oral reading performance, (3) estimating reading levels, (4) identifying inhibiting factors, (5) determining chief skill deficiency area, (6)  determining word identification technique, and (7) locating word recognition difficulties. Among the conclusions, it was stated that most instruments cannot be used to determine the chief area of skill deficiency, including specific problems of vocabulary, comprehension, and rate. Word recognition subtests are limited in scope of subskills assessed and emphasize spelling ability. In addition, skills for monosyllabic words are more often measured than skills required to unlock polysyllabic words. Group-administered tests are limited to silent activities. (WB)",

A cognitive-biological approach to the child's perceptual system development is taken, and data are presented to support both the developmental point of view of language development and the point of view that the child reconstructs all sensory input. Two critical phases in learning to read are delineated: (1) the child's previous ability to comprehend and decode speech auditorily as a prerequisite to decoding print and (2) the child's understanding of the relationship of spoken speech to the written symbol system for speech. The point is made that oral language is important only in that it may reflect cognitive and perceptual mastery of language, but it  is an insufficient and inaccurate predictor of many children's capacity to learn how to read.

Instruction should begin with the teacher's evaluation of the reader's functioning skill level, his psychological characteristics, and the nature and quality of his stored information. Skillful reading instruction from the beginning and at all levels contributes to this essential objective--reading as a thinking process. The flexible reader, as a result of his attention to purpose, difficulty of material, complexity of theme, and background knowledge must make adjustments in his reading approaches. Variability in rate does result from this reading-thinking process. Therefore, teachers should present their students with varied  reading material, provide exercises in reading for a variety of purposes, and frequently assess progress in developing reading flexibility.

The degree of suitability of programed texts in reading instruction for primary children at various intelligence levels, at various age levels, and in different sex groups was also investigated. Treatment 1 followed a conventional approach in which commercial programed materials were deprogramed by stapling immediate feedback columns on the pages of the linear text so the learner could not use immediate feedback information. Treatment 2 used the same commercial series as  Treatment 1 but in the prescribed programed way. Treatment 3 used the same series as Treatment 1 and 2 but with audio-reinforcement. An analysis of variance revealed Treatment 3 to be the most effective in grade 1 and Treatment 2 to be the most effective in grade 2; grade 3 findings were not statistically significant.

Since associative words apparently have high mnemonic cue value, they have been the subject of numerous investigations. The author's experiment varied associative level and measured retention by content words, sequences, total words in sequence, average length of sequence, and idea units. The results indicated that the low-associative passages, not the high-associative ones, had consistently higher retention. Since this conflicted with numerous studies by Rosenberg, attempts were made to account for them by examining other research studies related to (1)  the effects of associative strengths in child verbal learning, (2) the role of associative connections in processing discourse, and (3) different retention measures and their relation to a two-component memory analysis of discourse processing. Although the principle of associative wording as the key to retention of connected discourse was generally supported, further research was recommended on associative density, size of the associative unit, and associative saliency.

        "description":"Variations between standard and nonstandard dialects are described as they relate to teaching reading. Children, when they enter school, have developed patterns of oral language which affect their abilities to learn to read in proportion to the degree to which their language patterns vary from standard English. Studies have shown that while disadvantaged children have more poorly developed language skills than their middle-class counterparts, they can be given instruction which will raise these skills. Speech should be encouraged without correction of dialectal differences as mistakes by providing stimulating experiences such as field trips, book sharing, films, pictures, etc. Teaching methods such as those used in English as a second language programs may be used profitably in  direct language skills instruction.

Sixty introductory psychology students participated in the first experiment, which tested the differential effects of phonological and semantic cues on the speed with which a verbal unit can be identified. For the second experiment, 20 undergraduate students took part in two sessions to investigate the question of verbal meaning. When presented visually with a verbal item, the subject had to decide rapidly whether it was or was not a part of his vocabulary. The results of the two experiments indicated that both phonological and semantic cues had an influence on identification speed for verbal material. The most important  implications for reading research were drawn from Experiment 2, since it appeared to be a better analog of what the reader does than those experimental tasks which have been used in former research. Use of the same methodology employed in these experiments with more complex materials was recommended for further research. Tables and references are included. (DH)",

Consideration is given to three factors: (1) the existing need for theories and models in the systematic study of the relationships among the comprehension skills, (2) the definitive purposes served by models and theories, and (3) a discussion of three theories reviewed from theoretical and empirical research utilizing models based on these theories which explain how the component skills of reading comprehension are related to each other. The three theories are defined as follows: (1) The independent or isolated skills theory  implies that reading comprehension is a set of different processes which may be learned independently from each other and in any sequence. (2) The global theory asserts that reading comprehension is a single or unitary general process, which after being learned will enable the learner to answer any kind of comprehension question about a given passage. (3) The hierarchical skills theory asserts that reading skills can be arranged into levels according to the complexity of the behavior necessary to learn each skill. Implications are also made to contemporary educational practice. Tables and references are included. (Author/DH)",

Approximately 15 first graders were randomly assigned to each of the 10 treatment conditions. In the first experiment, four types of letter training were compared to two control conditions. The experimental conditions were (1) high phonic correspondence between letter name and sound (ABAcBc), (2) high mediating correspondence between letter name and sound (ABAcB'c), (3) low correspondence between letter name and sound (ABAcCc), and (4) first task observation of letter stimuli (AOAcBc). The control conditions were (1) warm up (ABCcDc) and (2) no letter training (--AcBc). Results showed a significant effect attributable to presentation method,  with the ABAcBc and ABAcB'c tasks producing the greatest transfer and AOAcBc producing the least. The second experiment used preliminary training in mediational cues in ABAcBc to determine whether this would increase transfer to the second task. Three groups, ABAcBc, ABAcCc, and --AcBc, were compared. Results showed that training improved performance significantly. Conclusions reached after the two experiments were that (1) the ABAcBc paradigm produced maximum transfer, indicating that a phonics approach to reading is the most efficient and (2) mediation skills training is valuable in tasks such as these.

One hundred and thirty-one children from three schools in Palo Alto, California, were given reading instruction using a linguistic approach (Palo Alto Reading Program), and 115 children from three Palo Alto schools used a whole-word approach (MacMillan, Harper and Row, and Scott-Foresman). A battery of pretests was administered in September 1969, and a battery of post-tests was given in January 1970, after an instructional period of 70 days. The hypotheses tested were (1) children high in sequencing ability will exhibit higher reading achievement and less learning avoidance behavior in a whole word method than in a linguistic method and (2) children low in  sequencing ability will exhibit higher reading achievement and lower learning avoidance behavior in a linguistic method than in a whole word method. The results showed that children high in sequencing ability exhibited higher reading achievement in the linguistic treatment than in the whole word method, while children low in sequencing ability exhibited lower reading achievement in the linguistic treatment than in the whole word treatment. Sequencing ability was negatively correlated with learning avoidance behavior in the whole-word treatment, but was not correlated in the linguistic treatment. References and tables are given. (DE)",

The subjects were 32 elementary teachers within five mid-Michigan public school districts. A control group of 16 teachers taught science in the conventional manner. The experimental group received an in-depth study of the Science Curriculum Improvement Study's (SCIS) teaching methods and materials at a 3-week workshop, and used the teaching methods and materials suggested by SCIS in their classrooms. The study was designed as a quasi-experimental, time-series analysis and involved a series of science teaching observations over a one-year period. Each science lesson was recorded with portable tape recorders, and two of the three instruments used in  evaluating the data were concerned with information gathered from analyses of the taped lessons. The data indicated that the SCIS teachers differed significantly from those teachers employing conventional science teaching methods and materials by demonstrating an increase in the amount of direct teacher influence displayed in verbal behavior patterns during science activities. Additionally, the SCIS teachers displayed a preference toward asking high-level questions of children. Bibliography. (LC)",

The mechanical concept of work has led to confusion in the quantification of exertion, and units of impulse are suggested as preferable when irreversible transformations of chemical energy in human muscle are considered. The interaction of the subject's structure and the mechanics of the resistive devices requires the equation of subjects geometrically in both cross-sectional  studies and within-subject comparisons.

        "description":"Reported are the results of an eighteen-month study of junior college students using programmed algebra materials. Of the 118 students tested at the beginning of the study, only 77 completed the course. When the students were divided into three subgroups based on either their entering mathematics ability or reading ability, the highest group performed significantly better (.01) than those in the lower groups. There was no significant difference between the lower groups. All students were most successful with problems involving manipulation of algebraic terms, but had difficulty with recall or with verbal problems. There was no significant difference between students' pre- and post-attitudes. The author concluded that a motivation factor might have influenced the research results.  (RS)",

        "description":"The Interpretive Study of Research and Development in Elementary School Mathematics was designed to attack the problem of applying research in the classroom by providing a compilation of the research and a synthesis of the findings. The purpose of Phase II of the Study was to develop materials which could be readily used and disseminated. A set of eleven bulletins and a set of five films were developed for use by college teachers of courses on the teaching of elementary school mathematics. This report concentrates on the development, dissemination, and evaluation of these bulletins and films. Copies of all the bulletins and scripts used for all the films are included in the appendices bound with the report. One conclusion drawn from the reactions of those receiving the developed  materials is that there is a continuing need to provide a readable, readily available source of information on research related to teaching and learning elementary school mathematics.

        "description":"Two of these three pamphlets describe methods of teaching young elementary school children the principles of sampling. Tiles of five colors are added to a tub and children sample these randomly; using the tiles as units for a graph, they draw a representation of the population. Pooling results leads to a more reliable sample. Practice is given in estimating population sizes by a capture-mark-release-recapture technique, first using colored beans, then with marked mealworms. The variation in estimates caused by sampling is indicated. The third pamphlet, for use with children in grades 4-6, depends upon some knowledge of sampling techniques. Its purpose is to introduce children to some possible explanations of biological diversity. Children study themselves and collect data on  tongue-rolling ability, estimating its frequency in the population. Then a continuous variable--weight or length of seeds--is studied. Heredity patterns are developed and the idea of selection introduced. Practice in using histograms to record data is included. Each pamphlet contains background information and suggested teaching techniques. This work was prepared under an ESEA Title III contract. (AL)",

Teaching procedures to investigate wind, shadows, liquids, colors, and color change, and aspects of sampling populations are outlined. Simple apparatus and experiments are suggested, and details of the construction and preparation of the materials are given. The following ideas are developed: the nature of different types of water pollutants depends upon physical properties of liquids; color change can be an index of other changes in organisms; shadows are predictable and related to movements of earth and sun; shade has effects on organisms; environmental factors have an effect on wind speed and direction; and factors influencing the  validity of statistical samples are sample size, sample selection, and sample number. Opportunities for interdisciplinary activities are mentioned, particularly those using mathematical skills. Background information for the teacher is included in all units.

A two-part questionnaire was sent to selected instructors of elementary science methods courses at 118 institutions. Results of the study showed that (1) the AAAS, ESS, SCIS, and MINNEMAST programs are the most widely taught new courses in the methods classes, (2) institutions with greater enrollments expended more funds for science than smaller universities, and (3) 40 percent of the instructors had attended a workshop in the new  science programs. Factors influencing the teaching of the new science programs, and in their implementation into the schools were identified. Several recommendations are offered by the investigator as guidelines for additional action and research in the area of new science education.

A science based culture cannot be understood by the separate study of disciplines, each with its own body of technical information and autonomous theories. The science knowledge of most worth for general education is that which reflects the spirit of science, and the social, the cultural, the technological and the humane phases of the scientific enterprise.

It is designed to allow a more intensive in-depth study of the nation's development and of our present political and social institutions. Thus, four major themes have been divided into broad problems with the subject matter indicated by specific questions: 1) the structure, operation, and evolution of the American government; 2) the pluralistic nature of American society; 3) selected social and cultural institutions which have developed with changes in the American way of life; and, 4) the formulation and development of the United States foreign policies as the country changed from a colony to a world power. Related important  current events are woven into the curriculum. Fundamental to this course is the need for student inquiry and investigation leading to the development of critical thinking. To teach conceptually, an interdisciplinary approach requires incorporation of the basic concepts and methods of all the social science disciplines. The suggested learning activities and media which follow the content outline contain possible approaches for teaching. SO 000 265 discusses the basic considerations of the curriculum series. (SBE)",

It is the basic tenet of this study that the differences in background, attitudes, and behavior of secondary school teachers in Uganda have significant implications for the effects which schools have on the attitudes, values, and knowledge of the pupils. The identification of various types of teachers in terms of their own orientations towards crucial aspects of the national development of Uganda provides important baseline information for further studying the school as an agent of political socialization in new states. Chapters include descriptions of: 1) educational system in Uganda; 2) sampling procedure; 3) pretest, coding and analysis, questionnaire  administration, data processing; 4) factor analysis; 5) definition of teacher groups; 6) teacher communications behavior, affective and cognitive orientation toward government, awareness and discussion of National affairs; 7) teacher views of pupil participation, and relevance of education; 8) teacher interaction with society, and the community; and, 9) teacher as an innovator. The present analysis could prove useful for the planning tasks of recruiting, training, and utilization of the teachers. (SBE)",

The specific problem is to conceptualize the independent variables which can be considered to have theoretical relevance for the formation of interpersonal attitudes, to derive from them conditions of interpersonal experience which can be expected to lead to the formation of positive attitudes, and to test the relationship between experience and attitude in an experimental design in a field setting. Chapters discuss: 1) theory of conditions of interaction to promote positive attitudes; 2) population and experimental sample; 3)  treatments of forced compliance and participation in goals, observation of interaction, attitude scales, sociometric test, measurement of actual associations, testing procedures; 4) statistical results and inferences; and, 5) theoretical and practical significance, i.e. under certain conditions, different patterns of classroom interaction do affect intergroup attitudes, and lead to better understanding of the relationship between education and the integration of social and political communities.

The methodology of multidisciplinary education planning through the use of general comparative analysis models of political, economic, and social development is explained: Almond and Powell's framework for the analysis of political systems, Ward H. Goodenough's paradigm of wants and needs of change agents and their clients, and Harbison and Myers' model for human resource development. Both the strengths and weaknesses of the methodology and the models alike are discussed: the validity of comparison, reliance on judgmental analysis, and the needs for precision propositions, cost analysis data, and educational research. The needs for political and economic  development and social change are considered from two points of view: the definition of the goals, and the relationships within and between these systems and education that are necessary for goal attainment. The models were used to determine the relationships and to logically analyze their (models) applications to the conditions in this developing area. It is assumed that education is necessary for goal attainment: leadership development, manpower and economic development, and participation of the people in the decision-making processes. (SBE)",

It is a case study of a country where the ideas of education playing an important role in modernization is only partially accepted. How do 216 Colombian leaders: 1) evaluate the performance of the educational system as a change agent, 2) make judgments about education -- definitions of problems, solutions, standards, values, perceptions, 3) define development -- integrated, multi-dimensional, one-faceted, 4) integrate the educational system into their concepts of national development, and 5) integrate other institutions, such as foreign agencies, the central government,  the Catholic Church, into their concepts of national development? In general, the interview results suggest that the leaders were not able to integrate the educational system into the process of national development. They showed only an incomplete grasp of educational process, the modernization process, or the idea of development; many of their ideas were conditioned by their position in society and special areas of interest; and, they were unable to consider other institutions or the government for integrated roles in development.

Comparisons are made between the various colonizers' Indian policies before the revolution, such as: 1) introduction of the treaty system by the Spanish; 2) emphasis on fur trade and conversion to Christianity by the French; and, 3) racial segregation by the English. Finally, United States policies, as well as unofficial practices, are surveyed since the time of the Continental Congress. Various legislation and commission reports are cited and discussed, culminated by a discussion of the 1969 report of Sen.  Ralph Yarborough's Committee on Labor and Public Welfare. Recommending 60 changes in Indian policies and procedures, the committee lays the blame for the Indian's life of poverty and despair on America's consistent failure to provide him with an effective education.

The general objective here was to develop awareness of the sociological research problems involved in the derivation of testable hypotheses from sociological theory, methods of collecting data, and the analysis of data in quantitative form. Consequently, the curriculum materials were developed stressing methodology but including substantive concerns. These materials consisted of a two volume case book of selected reading, commentary, and accompanying exercises (SO  000 276 and SO 000 277). During the life of the project, several courses concerned with law and social science research were taught at the University of Denver (Appendix C), and a summer institute, &quot;Social Science Methods in Legal Education&quot; or SSMILE, was held in 1967, 1968, and 1969 -- participants, syllabus, and materials are included (Appendix D).

Some reasons are: questions of moral responsibility involved in complying with public pressure for curriculum reforms; doubt that the experiences of black people justify study; general ignorance of Afro-American experience; and, society's disagreement over the purpose of education. There have been various theoretical models for curriculum development --the transmission of culture, socialization, transformation of society. None of these reflects the multi-ethnic nature of our people. The majority of people of African ancestry in America have had a sufficiently different culture and lifestyle to necessitate inclusion of black studies. The broad  purpose of black studies must be to help black people cope with the white world without making them completely alienated from it or subservient to it. Contemporary society, as it applies to black people in this country, could be one of the basic operational referents of the curriculum; the other might be black heritage, including African educational heritage.

The primary objective of this unit is to develop the concepts labeled place and environment. Material organization and teaching strategy involve a two-fold emphasis on concept acquisition and concept use. The materials require the student to make inferences, find similarities and differences, test hypotheses, and validate concepts. In effect, the conceptual structure of geography becomes a working basis for inquiry and the processing and categorizing of geographic data. The learning procedure closely related to the meaningful reception learning model of David P. Ausabel. The geographic concepts selected overlap with concepts in elementary social studies instruction. It is global in  scope in that information appropriate to development of the unit concepts is drawn from various places and environments around the world.

        "description":"Speakers on population matters often refer to the population explosion with an air of crisis. It is questionable that images of doomsday are defensible for us in our role as educators. The goals of population education are to develop an understanding of the impacts of population characteristics on national development, as well as their impact on the individual. A second purpose is to develop informed individuals who will make responsible decisions. Population study introduced population characteristics, and the causes and consequences of population change, and it includes a wide range of social phenomena affected by population. There are more than 20 countries now developing programs. However, the next step is to develop a population unit or cell within a country's educational  system, defining the objectives. The final decision is whether a series of new courses are needed, or whether population concepts should be infused throughout the existing curriculum. Population learning will probably be more effective if children are confronted with population material throughout their curriculum and throughout their entire school careers. Social studies offer particularly fruitful areas for population learning. In addition, population study should be part of teacher training. SO 000 291 is a directory of national programs. (SLD)",

No deliberate attempt was made to evaluate methods or particular findings.

        "description":"The approach to topographic map production has been highly organized and systematic with respect to scale, projection, grid, etc., so that the user can expect a high degree of locational accuracy. Less attention has been given by cartographers to symbolic information yielded by the map. Symbolization (information reduction) is required at all levels --including that of the survey. A number of factors should be considered in order to clarify what aspect of the feature the symbol is to concentrate on and what is being omitted, so that there is a clear identification of what the symbol is intended to convey to the user. If cartographic symbols can be devised to convey specific attributes of represented features, two other considerations emerge --the graphic structure of the symbols,  and the way the user responds to them. If premises are acceptable, the following conclusions can be drawn: 1) design of map symbols cannot be isolated from data collecting; 2) if informational content of maps is be increased and improved, there cannot be heavy reliance on photo-interpretation; 3) a more deliberate and systematic attitude about manipulation of graphic image will be necessary to make the map a more effective communication; 4) present interest in a digital form of map information makes sense only if equivalent standards can be applied and maintained.

The traditional elementary school social studies program has given little recognition to the American Indian. In an effort to change the attitudes toward the Indian of Indian and non-Indian children, a series of special lessons were prepared by this project. These lessons emphasized the positive aspects of the Indian, and brought out little known aspects of the contributions of Indians to our art, cultural heritage, and contemporary society. They made use of several media --8mm color and sound film, slide-tape presentations, and some commercial material, and  stress involvement on the part of the students. In order to measure the effectiveness of the special lessons, an experiment with a control group and an experimental group was conducted. Pre- and post-testing consisted of a semantic differential, an attitude scale, and a series of open sentence stems. It was found that the lessons did have a positive effect on the attitudes of both Indian and non-Indian children, and that the attitudes of Indian children were most improved indicating improvement in self-concept.

        "description":"Although over 40 studies have been done since 1925 on map reading, there is little understanding of children's ability to comprehend maps or the mental processes involved. Children's inability to read maps is well document, as are their improved skills after instruction. Yet map skills are part of the elementary curriculum. Success in teaching map reading skills is overestimated for at least four reasons: 1) an oversimplification of what is involved in reading a map; 2) teaching the wrong things about maps and not using maps in instruction; 3) failure to sequence skill development using large and small scale maps; and 4) ineffectual teaching techniques and omission of field instruction. Research shows that children are capable of using maps more effectively than they now do.  Perhaps we do not fully understand the development or operation of spatial abilities. Little theoretical work in this area, with the exception of Piaget, can be applied directly to map learning. It appears that as children move through the elementary grades their spatial abilities are suppressed if not extinguished. One method of encoraging spatial skills appears to be through techniques using large scale topographic maps in the upper elementary grades. Lastly, attention must be given to helping teachers understand maps and techniques of map instruction. (SBE)",

Under the authority of the Education Professions Development Act, the institute was comprised of the full-time summer portion and intermittent academic-year follow-up activities. The first two weeks of the summer institute involved the trainers only and dealt with problems of training aides and teachers. During the second two weeks the trainers were joined by teachers and teacher aides. Although some material on child development, curriculum development, and individualized instruction was presented, the major focus of the institute was on sensitivity training and  interpersonal relations. Evaluation of the institute by participants and an independent evaluation by Abt Associates indicated that the institute was successful in its objectives of fostering more sensitivity in individuals and greater exchange of ideas among educators filling three different roles in education.

Evaluation consisted of meetings  with project directors; questionnaires distributed to all teacher participants in the program, a sample of teacher colleagues of partnership teachers, and a sample of parents; and interviews with all part-time teachers, principals, partnership teachers, and a sample of children.

Another section details some additional problems related to research on teacher behavior, e.g., its noncumulative nature (researchers measuring different phenomena and variables, using different terms, methods, and assumptions), questions as to whether or not teacher behavior research may be beyond scientific analysis, and problems regarding teacher-researcher relations and practical application of theory.

        "description":"In the controversy over the inclusion of the teaching-learning process (curriculum development and instruction) as a subject of collective bargaining, discussion should focus on the changes which it might produce in the teaching-learning process. Curriculum development is unlikely to be greatly affected by collective bargaining, and any changes in classroom behavior which result from teacher control over curriculum development will be minor. At the elementary and secondary level the main forces for charge, exogenous to whatever structure has formal curriculum control, will be the major curriculum development project and statewide committees which establish framework and guides. Both are dominated by university professors. In contrast, instruction will be profoundly influenced by  collective bargaining with most changes for the good of students and teachers. Faculty curriculum committees which actually function as improvement of instruction committees need the strength which collective bargaining can offer. Administrators need not fear loss of power, which they never had, since positive classroom behavioral changes can only be induced through positive motivation. In a recent paper presenting the administration position on this subject, Dean Robert J. Alfonso of Kent State University presented seven predictions which, in my opinion, will not come true and ten suggestions which I must reject.

        "description":"A far-reaching 1968 study on teacher aides revealed that very little was known about the aid that aides supposedly provide. It was found that there is some direct relationship between the use of aides and action programs to improve instruction. Some general points crop up regularly: 1) Teachers who have aides usually will not do without them. 2) Teachers who are contemplating having aides often are very apprehensive about sharing the classroom with another adult. 3) Training programs need to be developed at which both the teacher and aide learn to work together. 4) Teacher aides are performing three categories of services: supervisory, clerical, and instructional. 5) Teacher aides generally express satisfaction with their jobs, but complaints relate to the teacher's  over-expectations or under-expectations of them. The roles must be defined. The rest of us might just play our roles by supporting the several differentiated staffing studies now under way and withholding judgment until the relevant data have been gathered and analyzed, and by staying off the bandwagon until more is known about the advantages and disadvantages. Many years may elapse before we really know what aid to education the teacher aides have provided, but the future looks bright. (JS)",

Its objectives were to train indigenous nonprofessionals as teacher aide assistants for employment in inner city and ghetto schools, to meet the current shortage of certificated bilingual teachers, and to pinpoint the need for community colleges to come to terms with the work-study approach to training programs. The 36 participants came from low-income minority groups, with approximately 50 percent black and 50 percent Chicano; only two were men. They were drawn from ten Los Angeles school districts, Head Start agencies, the Pasadena Commission on Human Need and Opportunity, and Pasadena City College, the host institution.  Problems were encountered in obtaining professional participation and cooperation from agencies, particularly in the attempt to encourage differentiated staffing and the increased use of paraprofessionals. The limited scope of the program precluded any major impact and it was not possible to discover any real impact on the school districts or on the trainees themselves. Some of the problems may be resolved in the 1970 program. There are 12 appendixes, including details of the objectives, correspondence, minutes of committee meetings, and the final evaluations of the trainees. (MBM)",

Twelve junior high school teachers and their students were observed and video-taped as they engaged in teaching and learning activities in the four subject areas of science, mathematics, social  studies, and English. Tapes of 34 class sessions were classified and codified using the 12-category Content Analysis System (developed and refined from a basic scheme of five categories: background, naming, defining, examples, and amplification). Analysis of data consisted of a classification of elements of content communication and the identification of larger and larger sequences of communication behaviors within which these content elements were found. Analysis of elements and larger sequences of data was made of the sample as a whole and within the sample according to subject area and according to individual teachers.

        "description":"This paper examines the organization, major functions, and general characteristics of Peruvian teacher education programs, as well as some recent attempts to effect qualitative changes in these and in teacher inservice education programs, which point the way to a more rational and modern normal-school system. The first normal schools, established in the 1820's, continued the social divisions of the colonial period, and true public education did not develop until after 1850. Teachers were prepared in convents and religious institutions until the government took control of education in the 1930's. The urban and rural poor received little or no education until after 1950. The existing teacher education programs are uneven in quality, conservative, and concerned with the transmittal  of a fixed body of knowledge. Many of the students in the 152 schools are motivated by a desire for status and titles rather than a desire to teach. Current reform programs seek to change the normal school curriculum from 3 to 4 years, to use a new process for the systematic, objective evaluation of student performance, to assign semester units of credit to all courses, and to close marginal, substandard institutions. Teams from UNESCO and Teachers College, Columbia University, are helping to implement these reforms. Difficulties have also arisen in finding the money to provide higher salaries promised under salary legislation (the 15215 law). (MBM)",

        "description":"A major objective of the final evaluation (third year, 1969-70) of the Grand Forks, N.D., ESEA Title III project was to test the effects of aides groups not intimately connected with teaching through survey of parents' opinions and attitudes of student teachers in classes where aides served. In addition to this, the cost utility study was expanded to include input from school board members and negotiation teams who rated the utility value of various aide tasks. Final efforts to validate the Teacher Aide Attitude Inventory (TAAI) included input from teachers not connected with the Grand Forks school system. (The attempt was to create an instrument to be used by schools contemplating an aide program to discriminate between attitudes of teachers toward aides.) A comparison of  perceptions of aides and teachers in Grand Forks on an Activity Sheet developed for evaluation of ten other teacher aide projects was carried out; it included evaluation of the compatibility between Grand Forks aides and teachers as well as contrast of responses on the Grand Forks project with those in similar projects throughout the U.S. Also, some aides participated in a study to determine whether there are valid predictors of aide success for use in hiring. (Included are explanation of procedures and summary of findings, the final version of the TAAI along with the other measurement instruments, and brief summaries of the 1967-68 evaluation and the 1968-69 evaluation (ED 035 580).

Conscripted men who are secondary school graduates but have not entered the university may enter the Army of Knowledge for four months basic military and pedagogical training before being sent to a village for 14 months of teaching and community activities; then if they volunteer to become regular teachers they receive four months teachers college training and often return to the same village. 2) The National  Committee on Literacy concentrates on teaching adults in towns and cities. The part-time teachers, secondary school graduates drawn from a variety of occupations, take a course (twenty-two 2-hour lessons) in the method of teaching adults to read, write, and do simple arithmetic. Then the teacher recruits his own sutdents (20-40) and is paid partly on the basis of how well they do on examinations at the end of two 6-month courses. The national illiteracy rate has been lowered since 1963 from 80 percent to 50 percent. (Administration of the two programs i s briefly described.

        "description":"The program objectives were to develop teachers' skills in working with disadvantaged parents to enrich the home learning environment for children, and to develop and test the approaches to be used. Weekly home visits were made by 20 participating teachers who selected the families, and emphasis was placed on supporting innovation by the teachers to work out approaches reflecting the diverse competences and needs of individual teachers and families. The report documents and evaluates the process of staff-teacher and teacher-parent interaction in terms of 1) the kinds of resources, supervision, and support which may be needed by teachers making home visits and 2) the key variables to be taken into account in such a program. A resource center for teacher-visitors and strategies for  promoting innovation by teachers are described, based on the premise that teachers who are offered choices among resources are more likely to offer similar choices to families. Characteristics of families and visitors, and the teaching strategies which resulted from their interaction are identified. The nine appendixes include a description of the children's program at Pepper House, also run by Pacific Oaks College, as well as a chronology of the seminars, forms used for data on home visits, reports on spin-off activities, and reports on systematic measures used.

Analysis of videotapes of teacher performance reveals that both objectives were achieved. Participants were drawn from the staff of a behavior modification training day care center; included were three college student behavioral specialists, eight foster grandparents who were classroom aides, and three mothers who worked as volunteer helpers and were trained to conduct behavioral modification programs with their own children. In phase 1 staff members were videotaped daily as they followed  instructions in administering programs designed to teach children simple skills. Tapes were replayed with each teacher immediately following her daily session and appropriate behaviors praised. In Phase 2 (8 weeks of daily 2-hour sessions) foster grandparents were given informal lectures and videotape demonstrations on behavior modification. Later videotapes of their own teaching were replayed for group discussion. In phase 3 mothers read a programed text on social learning; then role playing and videotape demonstrations were used to teach them necessary skills. After instruction in her own child's program, videotapes of the mother's own performance were analyzed after each tutoring session. (JS)",

Focus was on the administrator's conception of his role, the development and utilization of innovational practices, and the methods and procedures used in the evaluation and dissemination of information about innovational programs. The literature on processes and procedures of change was reviewed. The 12 school districts selected for study were mentioned most frequently as being innovative in a poll of all Illinois school administrators from districts of 2,000 or more students; they included five high school, four elementary, and three unit districts--eight in Cook county, four in central and southern Illinois.  Interviews were conducted with each chief administrator. Responses were analyzed and summarized and the consistent critical factors necessary for education change identified: adequate financial support, a well-trained staff, organized planning, an understanding of human relations, staff commitment favorable to change, adequate physical facilities, an administrative staff which encourages change and staff participation in innovation, awareness of community needs, a planned communication network for disseminating information, a supportive public opinion, and the use of evaluative techniques for continuous program evaluation.

The year's most significant developments are these: 1) AFT, through participation in the Full Funding Committee coalition, succeeded in winning bigger appropriations for federal aid than ever before. 2) Efforts to include paraprofessionals in the union had been successful in Philadelphia, New York, and Newark. 3) Since the 1956 expulsion of southern locals which refused to integrate, organizing has been difficult but is now progressing on an integrated basis; situations in Georgia, Tennessee, Texas, New Orleans, and Florida are encouraging. 4) In the fight against anti-teacher injunctions, Hawaii and Pennsylvania have  already passed laws allowing teachers to strike under certain circumstances. 5) Union action has exposed and forestalled many such panacea schemes as educational vouchers, performance contracting, and differentiated staffing. I would like to see the Full Funding Committee expanded into a kind of &quot;children's lobby.&quot; We continue to be active on the civil rights front. Nothing has come of our efforts toward the uniting of AFT and the National Education Association for teacher unity. Now we must increase the Militancy Fund to support such improvements as our More Effective Schools plan which continues to demonstrate that good teachers with smaller classes and time for planning can educate children despite the problems.

A sub-purpose was the development of an observation instrument to provide a timed record of teacher behavior, and this was found to be valid and reliable. Five research questions were formulated and statistical hypotheses established to answer them. Ten teachers with aides and ten without were studied by trained observers for four 10-minute periods. Pupil achievement was measured by the Lee-Clark Reading Readiness Test at the end. No significant difference was found between the two groups of teachers  in clerical activities, routine activities, total group instruction or differentiated instruction. The teachers with aides spent more time in clerical activities and total group instruction. There was no common pattern of aide activity and teacher activity. There was no evidence that the aides provided more instructional time leading to improved pupil performance, although it seemed that teachers with aides were somewhat more successful in improving the achievement of lower level pupils.

The program was devised to meet the needs of teachers in areas where handicapped and educationally disadvantaged children are placed in regular classrooms. It was also intended to train adults from disadvantaged groups as teacher aides, thus making use of their special ability to relate to disadvantaged children. The training program involved seminars on the intellectual and emotional development of children, methods of observing and recording behavior, methods of interpreting observation records for evaluation and curriculum planning, use of educational media, and team teaching and planning. An equally important part of the program was practical experience as a member of a team in the  laboratory school. Extensive evaluation of the program indicated that participants improved their knowledge of and attitudes toward special education, and their students made significant gains in achievement. Other important evaluation findings were that special students can be educated in regular classrooms if a ratio of 1 to 5 is not exceeded and if enthusiatic and dedicated educational personnel are utilized.

The conclusion indicated that the objective data obtained reject some of the null hypotheses, but fail to reject others. This means that if other factors were not operating, the program showed some desired effects. Part 2 examines the logs kept by students to record their reactions in order to determine if program  objectives have been met or if curriculum ajustments are needed. The objectives include acceptance by the student of feelings about himself and others, and the maintenance of optimum morale. Conclusions indicate that some of the student teachers were influenced in the direction of the objectives, and the need for certain curriculum improvements were suggested.

The fourth chapter of the report describes the attitudes of public school teachers toward the United States and  North Americans. The last part of the report deals with professional aspects of teaching. It discusses teachers' attitudes toward their college preparation, their recommendations to teacher training institutions, their opinions about teacher participations, and their suggestions for improving the profession.

A survey of some of this literature, therefore, can help interested teachers make selections appropriate to their needs. In film study, significant both as a medium of mass entertainment and as a major art form, a number of pamphlets, articles, and textbooks contain detailed discussion of aims and methods of film study and lists of films. While only one textbook is currently available on popular music, several essays and articles represent a variety of current points of view on the importance of pop music in the classroom, included as a  means of training students in more sophisticated discrimination. Some of the current materials on television, advertising, the press, comics, and popular fiction both demonstrate the close connection between mass media and the teaching of literature and set mass media in its proper social context and in the lives of today's students. (Included are a checklist and an analysis of current essays, journal articles, textbooks, and books, largely British, on various aspects of the mass media.) (DD)",

Teachers often produce plays because they are popular, neglecting good innovative and experimental works in favor of musical comedies, and spending time building elaborate sets instead of helping their students understand the theater as art. To counteract this commercial influence, teachers can select plays that focus on characterization and can adopt a minimal staging approach (e.g., building sets only from a standard collection of platforms, cubes, and rectangles).

Speech may be viewed as a community of persons with a common tradition participating in a common dialog, described in part by the memberships and activities of its learned societies. Speech as a separate discipline evolves from (1) the informal rhetorical theories of the Egyptians (2900 B.C.), (2) the systematic treatises of Aristotle, Cicero, Quintilian, and Augustine, (3) the 18th century concern for communication in a parliamentary society, (4) the 19th century interest in language and style, and (5) the 20th century need for a clear, precise system of communication based  upon research using such modes of inquiry as description, experimentation, and historical or rhetorical analysis and synthesis. Since the act or process of communication (an essential function of mankind) is the domain of the discipline of speech, and is a necessary element in most intellectual and scientific disciplines, the practitioners of speech must construct relevant programs which provide links between theoretical principles and effective practices.

This may be accomplished, first, by examining the behavioral characteristics of the liberally educated adult to see what behaviors should be encouraged in students; and second, by employing the following tentative rules for writing behavioral objectives which are useful in guiding instruction without becoming trivial: (1) write behavioral objectives only for higher level behaviors to avoid triviality,  (2) state all behavioral objectives in binary terms--pass or fail, present or absent--thus placing emphasis on the success or failure of the teacher and not on the ranking of students, and (3) define behavioral objectives broadly (e.g., students will cut class less often, fewer students will drop out of school.)

Although Hawthorne (unlike Ralph Waldo Emerson) perceives evil as an extraordinarily potent force, he offers no clear moral solutions in this story, but examines various dimensions of the problem of evil. The story concerns the blighted love of two beautiful &quot;innocents,&quot; while the theme raises the question of which is real, appearance or substance, by simultaneously developing a sense of physical voluptuousness and spiritual love. The idyllic garden with its central poisonous shrub and life-nourishing fountain provides a traditional setting for the four characters, each of whom is enmeshed in his own sin. The moral  tangle is clarified, but not resolved, when Beatrice is killed by an antidote she takes to rid herself of her &quot;inherited&quot; poison. Each of the three men in the story is guilty of her death, though each has acted in good faith--Rappaccini, because he experiments with human beings to add to his scientific knowledge; Giovanni, because he urges the fatal antidote on Beatrice to perfect her; and Dr. Baglioni, because he eagerly provides the antidote in a fit of professional jealousy for Rappaccini.

Helping children learn to express and understand ideas, to attain self-realization, to improve social adjustment, and to participate in group action are essential educational objectives for (1) the pre-school, where children often need direct, positive instruction in the basic skills of listening and speaking, (2) the elementary school, where children learn to apply the tools of thinking, speaking, and learning, and (3) the secondary school, where more specialized training in speech is offered. Improvement in the quality and type of  instuction of oral communications calls for a reexamination of teacher training practices, personnel placement policies, inservice and institute programs, and curriculum and research projects.

In this study, empathy was measured by an objectively scored empathy scale; the communication process was represented by an encoding-decoding task (using abstract designs) to provide quantitative estimates of encoding and decoding ability. For 42 men and women, the average correlation between empathy and encoding skill was +.60, the correlation between empathy and decoding was +.14.

Reactions of the Manhattanville children, who received training in creating and experiencing contemporary music, differed from those of their California peers who received other types of musical training. Some of the observations made were that (1) musical children of the same age score similiarly though drawn from divergent programs; (2)  Manhattanville subjects were more perceptive than their California counterparts but less likely to agree that the original composition excels its mutilation; and (3) individual differences are greater within samples than between them.

The UCLA Head Start Evaluation and Research Center found it necessary to design an instrument which would focus on those attitudes of teachers which relate to the conduct of a comprehensive testing program to investigate fully an intervention procedure designed to foster favorable attitudes toward and increased understanding of the evaluation program. The Fishbein Attitude and Beliefs Scale theories, which hold that an individual's attitude towards any object is a function of his beliefs about that object, were selected as the most appropriate. The Teacher Attitudes Toward  Evaluation (TATE) was developed and the pilot test indicated that there was a high positive correlation between the attitude toward the object and the obtained measure of the attitude. Subsequent use of TATE in a field study revealed that in almost all cases increases in knowledge about the research or evaluation in progress were paralleled by increases in favorable attitudes toward various components of evaluation. These changes were significantly greater for a group which received feedback, but this was true only on the items related to the intervention itself. Analysis of the responses to the TATE scales is provided and further use of the instrument in evaluation studies is suggested. (PR)",

The 11-page survey instrument called for judgments and responses in these areas, among others: stating the most basic educational need of students in the Dayton schools; suggesting ways of improving staff integration; determining the theoretical value of 14 teaching skills in new situations; self-ratings of performance on the same skills; appraising 21 statements about pupils and their achievement in integrated and in  racially isolated schools; giving opinions on 28 statements termed &quot;Dynamics of interaction&quot;; ranking causal factors of unrest in the schools; ranking the important factors in a list of 32, in terms of their interference with learning; identifying key factors to successful achievement in the grade and subject taught. Accompanying the detailed report is a 4-page Research Conspectus which gives an overview of highlights of the report and a copy of the questionnaire. Limitations on the study include a less than 30% return of the voluntary survey forms. (Author/DG)",

These tests are considered inappropriate because they fail to control question structure, to consider structures and operations the children may not have acquired, to account for dialectical differences, and to test adequately specific aspects of language acquisition. They do, however, measure the assimilation of a particular set of semantic associations and cultural values, and of a particular verbal style. It is suggested that linguistic factors be considered  in all tests for young children. More research is necessary on the types of structures and operations acquired by age five and on the nature of cross-dialectal comprehension. Until the results of such research are available scores on standardized tests must be used and interpreted very carefully. (PR)",

The specific assessment in Michigan involved an immediate determination of school performance in the areas of basic skills and then a further determnation of educational goals and procedures for assessing them. Descriptions of the level of educational performance and its correlates for the state, for geographic regions and types of communities, and for each of Michigan's local school  districts are included.

It was speculated that the lack of evidence that compensatory programs facilitate developmental changes in children might be due to actual lack of influence by the programs, to the subtlety of the influence, and/or the inappropriateness of the conceptual and analytical approaches to the data. The development and validation of the procedure was guided by two sets of hypotheses: that adequately reliable and meaningful factors would emerge from a factor analysis of the micro-environment assessment data, and that the factors would relate to post-test and change criteria, respectively. The children were observed in their natural program  environments and the data derived was reduced through factor analysis to individual child environment summary scores. Multiple regression analysis was performed on this data and the above hypotheses were supported.

The counselors while rating lowest with the teachers, rate highest with the students. Students suggested specific changes in the organizational and personal behavior of teachers, administrators, and staff. Additional informal meetings of the different groups provided data on further areas of  conflict that need more examination, such as teacher-counselor interaction, and minority group prejudice. Four important principles for good communication are presented as possible future guidelines: 1) creation of an informal atmosphere, 2) lessening of role playing to the point needed to maintain the structure of the school, 3) the willingness of all persons to share feelings as well as thoughts, and 4) the development of trust in all people in the school.

As a result, standardized tests and measures lacking in prescriptive information on students are falling into disfavor. The three principal past uses of evaluation--placement, research, and counseling--will be joined by evaluation that facilitates instruction, curricular management, and resource allocation. Teachers will need item analyses of an individual's performance on achievement tests to explore areas of weakness. Criterion-referenced tests, new inventory tests on relevant student background, process oriented measures, modality preference tests, cognitive style instruments, and the like. Curricular  management will strongly emphasize behavioral objectives, process (rather than input-output) measures, and relevancy tests. Comparison of school districts with similar inputs will emerge. Resource allocation will be strongly oriented to accountability with performance guaranteed contracts proliferating. The coming changes are exemplified by test selection committees which no longer consist mainly of counsellors, but include many teachers, curriculum experts, and administrators as well. The counseling profession is not adequately prepared to meet the schools' new information requirements and changes are necessary in pre- and in-service education. (DG)",

Starting from this premise, the present author asks whether the research methods of science are not really transferrable to the study of living persons and interpersonal relationships? Or, is another kind of research method needed to study the infinite variety and complexity of human experience. The case study method is suggested. This method broadens professional competence, has contributed to the professional literature, and can be undertaken without elaborate research programs. Examples of the latter are  noted. A pilot study using the case study approach to investigate the psycho-social aspects of the pregnancy experiences of adolescents, and attempts at and subsequent success in obtaining funding for a full scale project are described. This study and several others noted combine service and research programs in psychiatric social work. They promise to be fruitful. (CK)",

This handbook is one of six summaries of workshops (see TM 000 138) on the development of solutions for evaluating the effectiveness of educational programs under ESEA Title III at all levels within the state of New York. The first part considers the sources from which solutions might emerge and the translation of ideas into operating programs. Attention then focuses on the analysis of proposed solutions that may show positive effects, as contrasted with those that seem appealing but have little chance of making a real difference. The task of making solutions more relevant to objectives is approached in the reporting of sources of exemplary  and innovative programs, relating proposed programs to theory, and the questions to consider in program implementation. An appendix includes the various exercises that were presented; a brief summary, where appropriate, of some of the responses obtained; and an outline of the specific chronology followed during the workshops. Although funded by Title III, the content of the workshop sessions is considered appropriate for use with other Titles and large program evaluative problems. (TA)",

        "description":"One of six summaries of workshop sessions (See TM 000 130), designed to strengthen the evaluation of costly programs and their effects, this handbook presents an analysis of both random and nonrandom sampling errors by application of the Bayesian model. This model attempts to formalize the process and procedures of inference from data through explicit consideration of the researcher's beliefs, insofar as they bear upon the study underway. Thus, if he feels that nonresponse error, for example, is likely to be large, this feeling is incorporated into the model. Major error sources for each parameter are sampled and values of all the variables are determined to show how these parameters define the sampling problem. Another method involves formulation of error ratios in terms of  certain established values. An example of the application of the model to a survey using mailed questionnaires is given. (LR)",

        "description":"A review of the literature indicated that conventional tests are inadequate for accurate assessment of phonological discrimination ability in children. Higher error rates on discrimination tests than those which would be predicted from articulation measures seemed to implicate task variables. To reduce task difficulty, repeated contrast test pairs, consisting of CVC syllables in which the same phonemic contrast occurs twice, were developed. Multiple testing sessions were also employed to reduce initial task difficulty. Two experiments were conduced to determine the effects of task variables. The first experiment involved the use of nonsense syllables in an A-B-X paradigm. The subjects were 12 irst Grade and 12 Kindergarten children. The second experiment involved the use of real  word items from the Wepman Test of Auditory Discrimination and the subjects were the First Grade group from experiment I and a new First Grade group of 12. Experiment I showed repeated constrast pairs easier to discriminate than initial or final contrast pairs and that results were poorer on the first day. In experiment II, first day performance was also significantly poorer than the other days. It is suggested that repeated testing is necessary for young children and that repeated contrast pairs may provide a means of obtaining more complete assessment of phonological discrimination ability in children.

On this context, the history of educational testing and evaluation is briefly reviewed and some interesting new ideas noted. The rather recent concepts of formative versus summative evaluation, of fidelity versus bandwidth of information and of group evaluation versus individual evaluation might be of help to reshape evaluation positively if the  needs for evaluation can be examined within a framework of educational decision making.

If some skill prerequistites to learning which are not fully developed can be identified and strengthened, higher levels of achievement may result. The Metropolitan Readiness Tests (MRT) are routinely given to all University City kindergarten children. The test of Primary Mental Abilities (PMA) was then administered to groups of boys and girls who were reasonably representative of children in University City Schools in the second month of first grade, and the Stanford Achievement Test at the end of first grade. Analyses of the data revealed similarities and differences in the effectiveness of these tests in predicting performance, measured by subtests of the  Stanford Achievement Test, seven to thirteen months later. Both tests identified abilities and guided teachers in individualizing programs based on a child's developmental needs. However, the MRT were more applicable to boys, the PMA to girls. The use of the scores on both tests together added very little to their predictive value; the PMA test hs a slight advantage over the MRT if one had to select a single test. (Author/PR)",

        "description":"The reported failure of urban schools has been well documented by various government commissions. To remedy this situation, quality and equality of education must be insured. Research and development on disadvantaged populations has increased in an effort to reverse the effects of traditional pedagogical methods. Numerous programs for early intervention show that changes can be effected but that these effects have little long-term stability. But that does not mean that compensatory education is not a promising method; rather, that adequate methods and understanding are still to come. Various strategies and models for improving urban education are compensatory education, desegregation, model subsystems, parallel systems, total systems reform, and new systems development. In  addition, some programs attempt to change the student himself, his family, and the schools in new ways. College programs for disadvantaged youth try to prepare students for advanced study. The greatest policy problem is desegregation. Increase in federal aid raises the hope that urban education will receive not only more funds but also more attention.

        "description":"Disadvantaged and advantaged high school students were tested for their self-concepts and their perceptions of their teachers' views of them. The teachers' perceptions of these students were also measured. From the vocational classes of an urban integrated high school, a sample of 91 disadvantaged students (66 males and 25 females) and 71 advantaged students (54 males and 17 females) were randomly selected. The twelve teachers of these students were also involved. Disadvantagement was determined in terms of annual family income (less than $4,000), living quarters (low-rent tenements or subsidized housing), and receipt of state aid or welfare funds. There was a minority composition of over 50 percent Negroes and Puerto Ricans among the disadvantaged students, and a white majority  of 75 percent among the advantaged. An inventory of 40 bipolar traits was given to the students, and the teacher group was given some traits but with instructions to rate each of the students in the sample who were in the instructor's class. It was found that disadvantaged students view themselves similarly to how they believe others look at them, but the teachers actually see them less positively. However, teachers tended to think more highly of advantaged students. (Author/DM)",

The method used to test level of expectation, actual performance, and reactions to success or failure is a simple ring toss game. Subjects varied the difficulty of the task by standing at various distances from the target peg, indicated their expected performance on the task, and tossed the rings. On consecutive trials and across years, the subjects' patterns of dealing with their actual performances were recorded. Mexican-American subjects, on the whole, are most capable on the ring toss task and have the most realistic expectations; white subjects overestimate the most and have  the lowest actual scores. Ethnic group differences on these variables decrease after desegregation. Mexican-American subjects were found to have a more realistic increase in confidence following desegregation; and black children, highest in expectations, showed an overall decrease in anxiety.

Attempts are made to outline the potential of education for promoting the economic well-being of Canadians. It is found that the poor often get the poorer schools, programs, and teachers, rather than the special and superior programs which they appear to require. These inequities tend to be compounded by regional inequalities in ability to finance education. Throughout the brief, particular emphasis is placed on the severe educational problems of the Indians, Eskimos, Metis, and Negroes. It is suggested that the urban poor constitute the largest problem for the schools; but the native peoples, urban or rural, and the Negroes are  the most intractable problem. Seventeen recommendations concerning the alleviation of poverty are made, with particular emphasis on changes required in education. It is further recommended that resources for education be so distributed as to bring to disadvantaged children the special educational programs and facilities they need. Also stressed are parental involvement and special training of teachers. (Author/JW)",

The students will hopefully develop a capacity for self-directed study and positive attitudes towards learning and the school, as evidenced by higher levels of academic achievement and concern for other students. The Tutorial Community Project is proceeding in three main areas: (1) tutoring and related learning activities; (2) encounters or intensive group discussion; and, (3) community-school involvement activities. Activities in these three areas are being intoduced to the entire spectrum of elementary grades (K  through 6). After the first years, the results are fairly encouraging; however, many changes were made to meet problems as they arose. Experiments with the children serving as tutors made the most rapid progress, although the development of a sense of community among teachers, students, and parents was not as successful.

According to the theory of projective techniques, responses to pictures provide us with rich material on emotions. Osgood's Semantic Differential provides a potential means to analyze these responses. Two theoretical sets of ideas are brought together and also applied to fields of application relevant to social work. Some of the results are: (1) the Semantic Differential pattern of analysis can be applied when slide pictures are used as stimuli; in addition, attitude scales could be developed to masure hard to define  attitudes; (2) elicitation and analysis of thematic stories from candid photographic slides of racial and interracial scenes are considered reliable and may have utility in identifying and crudely differentiating racial attitudes; and (3) both subjective analysis and systematic, objective analysis of thematic material are possible; the combined materials are considered to provide rich and objective sources for psychological study.

Oral and written course work was presented in Spanish and English by a bilingual staff, mainly Latin American. First grade pupils learned to read in their mother tongue; reading in the other language began in the second semester. The curriculum was evolved through a search for existing bilingual materials and staff development of new media. Parents and community were represented by members of an Advisory  Committee which met regularly with the project director. During the school year, a total of 256 pupils participated at various times. There were 125 comparison pupils in three of the four schools. Findings at the elementary level at the end of the year conclude that kindergarten bilingual program and comparison pupils did not differ in achievement, as measured by the Test of General Ability and the Metropolitan Readiness Test. However, Oral English tests indicated 45 to 85 percent improvement by the end of the year in the bilingual kindergarten, first, and second grades. (JM)",

The difference in the value of the status characteristic of race proved to be associated with differences in rank order of the number of acts initiated, with the whites much more likely to have a higher rank in the groups than the blacks. The whites were also more likely to be influential in the making of group decisions than the blacks, expecially where the decisions were contested. In addition to some very quiet blacks who helped account for  these marked overall results, there were many moderately active and influential black subjects and three black subjects who were both &quot;high&quot; on influence and initiation.

        "description":"This report is one in a series of proceedings of Seminars on Manpower Policy and Program sponsored by the Manpower Administration. It is argued that psychologists can make their greatest contribution to solving the problems of the inner city not by helping to write the various commission reports following outbreaks of civil violence but by attempting to understand why the recommendations of such commissions are commonly disregarded. The key to a psychological understanding of this self-destructuve policy that American society is carrying out lies in our failure to achieve a realistic perception of the nature of the problems with which society is faced. The motivational key to many inner city hostilities is the intolerable gap between what residents of such areas desire and what  they can achieve. What a man has to have is not a job per se, but a position in which he can respect himself and be respected by other people; economic productivity is not essential. In conclusion, if through psychology one can deal with the irrational factors blocking progress, rational changes can be introduced. (JM)",

        "description":"This report presents the preliminary findings of a research project designed to investigate the ways local school systems in the North deal with de facto school segregation. The communities chosen for the investigation are those 95 cities in the Permanent Community Sample of the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) which are non-Southern and had a black population of at least 3,000 in 1960. NORC interviewers conducted a series of 18 elite interviews with local politicians, government officials, school system personnel, civic leaders, and civil rights leaders. The design and methodology was such that the interviewees were treated as informants giving information about the city rather than as respondents giving information about themselves. The report focuses primarily on the  decision-making processes revolving around the first major demand for the improvement of education for Negroes. Descriptive analyses of the demands presented to the school systems and the responses of the latter to these demands are presented. The decision of many school systems to initiate a busing program is further analyzed, and some of the correlates of this decision are discussed. Included among these correlates are the general liberalism of the school board, levels of controversy in a city, and the general level of civil rights activity in a city. (Author/RJ)",

The problem is with the form and shape of the institution in which administrators, supervisors, teachers, students, parents, communities, etc. function. Fundamental reform leading to a new and more relevant educational institution requires change in the three major pillars of the present educational system: (1) In governance, a realignment of the parties involved in the process of educational decision-making is required, involving a shift toward giving parents, community residents, and students an increased voice in policy. (2) In substance, a reform of the objects to  be achieved and the content to be learned is needed--involving the search for relevance toward more humanistically oriented curricula dealing with individual and group problems, and having a more functional emphasis; for example, preparation for major societal roles. (3) In personnel, opening educational systems by the people who will be responsible for implementation to a far broader base of talent than the conventionally prepared career educator is required.

It was predicted that older children would perceive faces of another race as less distinctive from one another than would younger children. Two interrelated studies were conducted. The first was a testing program which assessed the racial attitudes of second, fourth, and sixth grade children. The variables were, in addition to chronological age: race of subject, race of examiner, and type of testing instrument--direct questionnaire, Social Distance Scale, and projective. The second study selected a subsample  of these children, who were instructed to judge the similarity of schematic drawings of facial pairs which varied systematically along a number of stimulus dimensions. An apparent decline in prejudice with age was obtained on a direct questionnaire and Social Distance Scale, but was not evident on a more indirect measure. This suggests that the effects of social desirability must be considered, even in measuring the attitudes of young children.

It was predicted that disadvantaged children classified as poor readers would be significantly inferior to those identified as good readers on measures of psycholinguistic ability. The subjects were selected from a population of disadvantaged first-graders in Nashville, Tennessee. One group of subjects was taught to read using the Initial Teaching Alphabet; and the other, using traditional orthography. The subjects were divided into poor readers or good readers, depending upon their scores at the end of first-grade on the Metropolitan Achievement Tests. It was found that the  prediction that poor readers would be significantly inferior to good readers on psycholinguistic abilities was partially supported; however, some findings were not consistent. These might be attributed to salient differences between the two reading methods. The results suggest the presence of general deficits in the auditory receptive and vocal expressive abilities of poor reading children. It appears that remediation exercises for such children should focus principally upon improving these abilities in both the syntactical and automatic aspects of language. (Author/JW)",

        "description":"The main purpose of this study was to assess whether matching teaching methods to the auditory and visual perceptual strengths of second and third grade disadvantaged children would facilitate the learning of unknown words. A secondary objective sought to evaluate the relationship between a number of auditory and visual perception tests and a measure of reading achievement. It was predicted that the use of such teaching would facilitate learning to recognize unknown words. The total subject pool consisted of 105 Negro boys. To identify children with different perceptual characteristics, each subject was administered a battery of twelve tests which measured perceptual components thought essential to the development of early reading skills. The subjects were divided into perceptual  dominance groups. Attempts were made to teach each subject the recognition of 15 words by a &quot;look-and-say&quot; approach, and 15 by the phonic method. The comparisons involving the differences between perceptual dominance groups, methods of teaching, and order of teaching presentation failed to reach statistical significance. The conclusion is that disadvantaged Negro boys learn to recognize unknown words equally well under teaching procedures which match either their perceptual strengths or weaknesses; there is no relation between low perceptual test scores and reading performance.

Five hundred and thirty-eight subjects were used; the program's effectiveness was evaluated by the Metropolitan Achievement Test, the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities, the Peabody Language Production Inventory, and the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale. The results obtained from this  two year intervention gave only partial confirmation to the experimental hypothesis--that children in experimental reading groups would show greater achievement than those in control groups. Students in the SCRP group did better than those in the ITA or WIC groups. In general, the experimental reading results seem to support the inclusion of systematic phonic instruction in traditional orthography for disadvantaged children.

In contrast to the experimental groups, a control group used a conventional basal reading program. The effectiveness of the experimental programs was measured by various standardized tests, such as the Peabody Language Production Inventory and the  Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale. After three years of intervention, the two experimental approaches in combination appeared to be most effective treatment for improving the intellectual and language development as well as the school achievement and creative thinking of disadvantaged children.

A 99 percent response by employers demonstrated their willingness to participate in a voluntary statistical reporting program. The definition of a job vacancy as an unfilled job that an employer is actively seeking to fill by hiring a person outside his organization was found to be operational. Major findings included: (1) The total  estimate of eight to nine thousand job vacancies represented about 3 percent of all jobs in the country, (2) The sample size of 400 was adequate to provide reliable estimates of vacancies, (3) The estimated cost of continuing quarterly collection of job vacancy data in 146 major metropolitan areas of the U.S. was $8 million to $8.5 million per year.

In order to bring the two groups together, four major areas are emphasized: (1) efforts to change the attitudes of both employers and youth, (2) management assistance to modify jobs, (3) a counseling program for youth participants during the first 3 months after placement, and (4) uniform criteria to evaluate individual adjustment and company efforts. The findings include observations about the job adjustment of disadvantaged youth, evaluation of the project, and recommended changes for future efforts.

        "description":"America's $100 billion construction industry with its 3 million workers does not need harassment, unwarranted interference, or political denounciation; it does need better access to mortgage money, less costly materials at more stable prices, an end to archaic regulations that hamper productivity, more dynamic management, and--most of all--more trained workers. The actions outlined in this statement, together with the legislation to be submitted to the Congress by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, are designed to meet those industry needs. Construction costs are not the \"fault\" of any one group; they are the result of a system that urgently needs reform and modernization. We must take care, in making those reforms, to treat fundamentals rather than symptoms,  essentially to bring the supply and demand of labor, money and materials into better balance. That is the only constructive way to stop the spiral of construction costs. In so doing, we can simultaneously meet two of the Nation's most pressing needs: the need to open up new job opportunities for millions of working men and women, and the need to provide adequate shelter for everyone.

Although there are wide variations in effectiveness of various projects, the program has made important contributions abroad at comparatively small costs to the United States in money, manpower, and interruption of domestic programs. Recommendations for improving, continuing, and expanding are: (1) make a stronger commitment for building institutions, (2) develop more  flexible project agreements, (3) increase research and utilize knowledge on the institution building process, (4) employ basic ideas of land grant type institutions, (5) strengthen goals and commitments, (6) change aspects of technical assistance, (7) change orientation programs, (8) upgrade participant training, (9) develop a fuller public understanding of international technical assistance, and (10) strengthen international capabilities of U.S. universities.

Analyses of variance of mean scores revealed that there were substantial differences among persons who enter and graduate from different vocational programs on dimensions measured by the test battery. A sub-sample from two male and two female curriculums was selected for further investigation. Analysis of data by means of correlation techniques revealed that specific attempts to predict whether or  not persons could drop out of each of the four programs based on data from each instrument were not as successful.

Using data obtained from the State Department of Education, the comparison led to these four broad recommendations: (1) that the State be divided into 12 contiguous geographic Cooperative Comprehensive  Educational Service Centers, (2) that each of the 12 areas should also serve as a basis for occupational planning for Grades K-16, (3) that cooperative relationships leading to more effective coordination of resources be encouraged, and (4) that a planned scope of work encompassing the necessary studies to be conducted be taken up as a measure to insure the collection of factual data needed for effective planning.

For this reason and because it is an innovation in youth training in the United States, the school was evaluated for its efficiency and its effectiveness in preparing youth for the world of work. To gather the data necessary to evaluate this experimental program a series of questionnaires were used to survey-interview previous trainees, and to interview the trainee's family, employers of trainees, and personnel of schools attended by the trainee prior to entering MVVS. The survey revealed an overall placement rate of 88 percent for the first 2 training years, with the highest placement rates registered for auto training,  drafting, machine shop operator, and welding. Specific problems identified as hindering the placement of graduates included: (1) a previous court record, (2) the lack of a high school diploma, (3) the selective service status of many graduates, and (4) the lack of practical experience. Among the many recommendations is one stating that the pilot experimental title and concept should be reapplied to MVVS for at least 2 more years in order to provide a more complete evaluation of this type program.

Data collected through teacher-administered tests, included some 2,000 items of information about each student and some 1,000 items about each school. The student information included measures of (1) breadth of general information, (2) interests, (3) information in specific areas, (4) vocabulary, (5) motivational factors, and (6) scientific attitude. Other measures included those concerned with memory for sentences, the ability to use the English language, and tests dealing with  creativity and mechanical reasoning. Use was also made of inventories to explore personality, vocational interests, and experiences. This information is in the computer processing stages and will provide data for later reports describing the schools these students attended and the interests, aptitudes, abilities, activities, and plans of the students. Anticipated continuing studies will be made at one, five, ten, and twenty years. (Author/JS)",

The key experimental phases of the two studies compared the relative influence of Mexican-American and non-Mexican-American social models on Mexican-American and non-Mexican American 10th grade subjects. Among the findings in Study A was that subjects who saw social models of an ethnic group like their own scored higher on the measure of the subject's interest in occupations and related activities than did subjects who saw models of an ethnic group unlike their own. In Study B it was found that Mexican-American  subjects who saw the Mexican-American social models performed slightly more information-seeking behaviors, and made slightly more favorable attitude changes than did Mexican-American subjects who viewed non-Mexican-American models. Study B further suggested that films rather than written presentations are more favorably reacted to by all subjects and that female subjects responded to the treatment suggestions to engage in information seeking significantly more than did male subjects.

The interview questionnaire sought information on dissemination activities, job placement and followup inquiries, area economic data, use of secondary data sources, collection of planning information, advisory committees, and development of capabilities for program-related research and centralized information management. It was concluded that growth in overall enrollment has been indicative of effective dissemination of  program information. The level and diversity of program activity supports an opinion that accomplishments may be substantial. However, periodic evaluations have been made largely in terms of program characteristics, and they provide an inadequate basis for estimating the extent to which programs have contributed to closing gaps between manpower needs and outputs.

        "description":"Although all countries face shortages of professional personnel, the problem is especially critical for the developing nations, who face the drain of high-level manpower to developed nations. This study of the migration of manpower from the Philippines to the United States identifies the major factors in this exodus, improves prediction techniques, and analyzes ways to minimize emigration through improved educational programs. Out of a population of 9,613 college-educated Filipinos who studied in the United States between 1960 and 1965, 753 names were chosen through disproportionate stratified sampling of the medical and nonmedical segments of the population. After further division of the sample into those who returned to the Philippines and those who remained in the United  States, usable questionnaires were returned by 66 migrants and 188 nonmigrants. The report concludes from the data that migration is highly related to attitudes toward the home country, as well as personal characteristics such as age and sex. Consequently, a short-run program to reduce emigration should involve government support of education for individuals carefully screened for attitudes and personality traits. In the long run, however, education and the climate for research must be improved so that talent is adequately utilized. (BH)",

The response revealed that 194 graduates were employed in Jordan, and 90 of these were selected for further interviews. In addition, 22 work-companions and 58 workers doing the same tasks were interviewed. Findings concerning the utilization of the industrial school curriculum suggest that the more specific the training, the less its likelihood of being relevant to actual job-related needs. Therefore, the educational system should  put less emphasis on specific training and more emphasis on producing readily trainable, rather than specifically trained, persons. Also, a large share of future government investment should be used to expand and improve training opportunities within the employment system. An occupational upgrading program is needed in the private industrial establishments and well organized programs should be established for public industries. An Occupational Training Organization should be set up to articulate the program. A related document is available as VT 011 966. (SB)",

In addition, structured interviews were held with 243 workers to determine training history. Findings revealed that the intervening system acts as a link between the graduates and dropouts of the educational and employment systems. There is a trend toward transferring the training activities of the intervening system to the employment system. Utilization of school curriculum in performing current jobs revealed substantial  duplication of learning, and the general theory component was more useful in acquiring new skills, while specific skills were least utilized in employment. These findings suggest that the educational system of Tunisia should put less emphasis on specific training and more emphasis on producing readily trainable, rather than specifically trained, persons. To reduce educational expenses, the problem of dropouts and repeaters must be studied, and the educational system should be relieved of specific training functions in order to eliminate duplicate training.

        "description":"This final report concerns a pioneering, three-year curriculum development project dedicated to translating recent learning theory and laboratory findings into operational practice in an existing educational institution. This project produced a highly successful and unique course that teaches two semesters of economics that students can master in from six weeks to one semester's time. In the course, students negotiate individual learning contracts with instructors, making decisions on what they will study, what media they will use, and how fast they expect to progress. Detailed performance specifications were prepared first, and then media were selected and materials developed that would most effectively and efficiently meet those specifications. The report explains how the  course was developed, including the rationales, methods, and procedures which were empirically tested. Only a few educational development projects comparable to this in scope and goals have been conducted. None appears to have been documented in the form of developmental model for use by others, as is done here. (Certain pages may not be reproducible due to marginal legibility.) (Author/DB)",

This interaction will continue through a variety of communications approaches. This conference offered an opportunity for a face-to-face tutorial in which all parties could present their views, their needs and their limitations. The daily program format provided morning presentations by representatives of Federal information organizations, and afternoon presentations by participants representing non-Federal users of Federal information products  and services. The broad subject area covered on the first day of the conference was &quot;Sharing Federal Information Resources with Research Libraries,&quot; and &quot;Availability of Select Federal Information Services and Products,&quot; was covered during the second day. The discussion periods provided alternate views and candid criticisms. The needs of research libraries and the shortcomings of the Federal information resources were the two most constant topics. The value of the conference was expressed by calling for a second one. (Author/NH)",

Actual implementation of the E.I.E. program is examined through an analysis of nine county plans selected to represent a cross section of school districts in Florida. Primary sources of information are used in this study and include plans of school districts, evaluation reports of the districts, state publications related to the implementation of this program and personnel interviews.

It is program-centered and performance-centered and points to the opportunity for many people to participate in an effective way for the development and improvement of the teaching profession. Certification as a teacher should be related to one's ability to teach, that is, his or her competence. New certification regulations in the state of Washington are based on four fundamental standards: (1) Professional preparation should continue throughout the career of the practitioner; (2) School organizations, professional associations as well as colleges and universities should be recognized as preparation agencies; (3) Discussions about preparation should be based upon performance--performance  in relation to stated objectives in the world of the practitioner; (4) Preparation and career development programs should be individualized. The fundamental concept underlying attempts to develop new processes for certification is that roles in the educational world must change. If new directions in certification become law in the state of Washington, it is believed that the nature of teaching will change, school organization will change, and American education will change.

The search located relevant information by 24 abstract journals and 3 citation services, 18 abstracting cost figures, and 41 indexing cost figures. These reported figures were extracted with text or other amplifying comment and tabulated, with reference made to the included 79-item bibliography. Unit costs per bibliographic item were cited or computed. These data were plotted to detect possible patterns or trends. The reported unit costs for preparation of the secondary services were adjusted for 1968 dollar value and were plotted by number of items cited annually. Abstracting costs  and indexing costs were each plotted chronologically, and then in rank order with dollar value adjustments. Abstracting and indexing rates were plotted. The plots serve to illustrate the scattering of the data and emphasize the problem of drawing generalizations from the existing data. (Author)",

        "description":"This report analyses approaches to training of workers developed by parties to collective bargaining agreements. The Bureau of Labor Statistics examined 1823 major collective bargaining agreements each covering 1,000 workers or more. Fewer than 20% (344) of the agreements contained training and retraining provisions. Training clauses (provisions) were concentrated in six industries: transportation equipment, communications, machinery (except electrical), primary metals, utilities, and food industries. Three unions in particular were parties to significant numbers of negotiated training and retraining provisions: the Steelworkers (27), Auto Workers (40), and the Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (27). About 25% of the provisions (86 of 344) involved firms that employed 5,000  workers or more. A classification of agreements into groups by employment size indicated that the incidence of training provisions increased with the size of the bargaining unit. The nature and methods of training and the administration of provisions are also discussed. (Appendixes include selected training and retraining provisions; union sponsored programs in the maritime industry; and an indentification of clauses.) (PT)",

Students interviewed 76 persons in a rural village of two hundred families, all engaged in agriculture. The major sources of income were rubber and pineapple; other activities included fruit-growing and the production of the family food supply (to a limited extent). Principle objectives of the study were to: establish the level of practice adoption among the smallholders; determine factors associated with adoption proneness; and procure data on the diffusion of a specific practice through a village. Those who adopted first tended to be better educated, have larger  size holdings, be middle-aged, and participate more in organizations. The pattern of diffusion took time; primary sources of information were neighbors for all respondents and extension workers for the earlier adopters. Adoption rates for some practices, requiring little outlay of money, were in excess of half of the respondents. (The questionnaire is included.) (EB)",

It was found that all members were interested in the 34 practices and all were using about one third of them. High income respondents were closer to practice adoption than the low income respondents on 29 of the 34 recommended practices. Home demonstration club meetings, television, and the daily newspaper were the major sources of information on credit practices used by all respondents.

An assumption is made that Extension is also an open system, where an observable improvement process occurs. The model permits an idea to be traced from the point where it enters the system to where it becomes part of the organization's action program. The flow may proceed through the stages of research, development, diffusion, and on to adoption. An essential part of the model is its social change mechanism which includes (in the case of university extension systems) administrators, specialist staff, program participants, and a governing board. An example illustrates the importance of interaction between representatives of these  groups if commitment decisions are to be reached about improvements in the system. (Four figures are included.)

Out of 317 eligible inmates, 172 enrolled. The evaluator interviewed inmates, teachers, and prison administrators, and collected data for comparisons between the Lompoc program and other approaches. Machines displayed the special advantage of defining the teacher role as benign and supportive. The teachers, who became primarily observers of the learning process and evaluators of programing effectiveness, have tended to receive their new role favorably. The inmates clearly preferred machines for learning facts by rote. Student grade year gains ranged  from .8 (on a 20 hour verbal skills course) to 2.4 (in a 13.5 hour number facts course), with an overall mean gain of 1.4 grades for 24 hours of study. Results achieved in the FCI program seemed to compare favorably with those from other methods. Systematic dissemination of the Allen teaching machines throughout the Federal panel system was urged.

Most of the enrollees were graduated from hospital diploma programs and one out of three had had additional  education beyond the basic diploma. The largest number had been inactive from 11 to 20 years. One of ten indicated an unsatisfactory or inadequate orientation to the position they held. Their main problems in returning to work were lack of confidence, inadequate orientation or supervision, unfamiliarity with new medications and treatments, adjusting their time, and their family's adjustment.

        "description":"This paper focuses on role relationships and role conflicts between professionals and paraprofessionals and their potential effect on the efficiency of future social services. Role conflicts can develop when roles are undefined and when there are competitive versus complementary role relationships. The most productive way to approach role definition is the systems approach--determine the overall purpose of the agency; defint this purpose in terms of specific objectives needed; and identify the various methods, personnel, and facilities needed to meet these objectives. Agency activities can be subdivided into: (1) task functions (program design, work facilitation, and goal emphasis), and (2) maintenance functions (support, interaction facilitation, and communication facilitation).  There are roles within each of these functions that can be taken by both professionals and paraprofessionals, but the greatest contribution the paraprofessional can make is in closing the cultural gap between professional and client group and in setting a role model for the community.

Ten consultants discussed the philosophy, practice, organization, planning concepts, and financing of the Model Cities Program and decision making, citizen participation, role of the board, and problem solving and group interaction. The participants felt that the training program had created a feeling of group solidarity and cohesiveness; small group discussion was  particularly helpful.

A control group of nine teachers was also used. The units dealt with the relationship of goals to decision making, the principle of diminishing returns, fixed and variable costs, substitution, opportunity costs, and profitable enterprise combinations. A multiple choice posttest measured the farmers' understanding. Special questionnaires were used to determine the  backgrounds and reactions of the farmers and their teachers. Prepared instructional units proved more effective than traditional methods. Group A slightly surpassed Group B, which in turn surpassed the control group. Young adult farmers' managerial and marital status, educational background, age and experience, and (for experimental subjects) the number of farm management meetings attended, were related to posttest scores.

Sections 3 and 4 deal with areas that have only distant implications for classroom practice, but which can contribute to greater understanding of how the reading process is learned and carried out; the language competence of beginning  readers and the relationship between spoken and written language. Section 5 gives examples of how such linguistic considerations have been applied in analyzing the process of reading and learning to read. Section 6 deals with regional and social variation in the English spoken by American children and touches on all the topics treated in earlier sections: the relation between spoken and written English, the possible effects of mismatch between the two on learning to read, and suggestions for educational practice to deal with these problems. Section 7 discusses problems of non-English speaking children. (Author/AMM)",

A discussion of early studies in the Gullah dialect (spoken chiefly in Georgia and South Carolina) is used to point out that Gullah, or any other speech, does not have a \"mutilated grammar,\" does not \"violate the rules of logic,\" and does have rules other than following the \"line of least resistance.\" Linguists accept without question the equality of linguistic talents among children of all races. Techniques for obtaining samples of natural speech and for testing the language ability of  Black ghetto children have been based on misconceptions of language and language usage. The author argues against Bereiter's assumptions concerning the \"underdeveloped\" language of culturally deprived children and contrasts these assumptions with those of Labov, Stewart, Fasold, and others. He examines attitudes toward language and states that schools could help human relations greatly by making students aware of such linguistic phenomenon as different levels of speech usage, which do not necessarily coincide or have the same implications among speakers of different backgrounds.

The author feels that the DSS  technique would be appropriate in establishing accurate baselines for research in language development and in comparing the relative effectiveness of various teaching methods. Its particular value is seen to lie in the fact that it, in contrast to other approaches, assesses the &quot;end product&quot; of language learning, the child's actual performance in verbal communication with the adult world.

It is stressed that such systems, although highly developed, do not recognize speech in the same sense as the human being does, and that they can not deal with a continuous random stream of speech but rather with segments of the length of a short sentence, selected from among up to a hundred possible choices. The use of ASR in educational technology is seen as inevitable since it will make it possible for a teaching machine to recognize and evaluate a student's spoken response, and the importance of this development in vitalizing present educational technology is discussed at some length. Finally a  hierarchy of achievable strategies for the use of ASR in teaching are examined, ranging from simple to sophisticated. Discussed are: sound/no sound discrimination, gross evaluation of utterance, gross approximation of choice, determination of acceptable pronunciation, diagnostic evaluation of pronunciation, and multiple choice drills. The author believes that teachers should welcome developments in ASR and help to participate in the development of education technology for language teaching. (FWB)",

The author discusses some factors involved: (1) Learners may be admitted to school at any age and placed in advanced grades with their age peers; (2) Some older learners may be functionally illiterate in their own language; (3) Learners may or may not have had some previous English instruction; (4) They may enter school at any time during the semester; (5) Their schooling may be broken frequently; (6) Many live in Spanish language enclaves; (7) Language skills must be developed so that the learners may talk and write about themselves and be able to participate as quickly as possible in the total school program; (8) Learners may experience  anomie if forced to function in English before they are ready; and (9) Efforts to resolve cultural conflicts may dampen the learner's desire to communicate in English. There is no one best way, the author stresses, for all students in all situations. Whatever the approach, the teaching of any feature of English should proceed sequentially. These steps, and suggestions for the teacher and administrator, are outlined briefly. (AMM)",

Scholars of ancient Japan extracted from the Devanagari those sounds which corresponded to sounds in Japanese and arranged the Japanese syllabary in the devanagari order. First appearing in a document dated 1204, this arrangement has been fixed since the 17th century. This arrangement was most convenient for the study of Sanskrit and was later applied by scholars of the history of the Japanese language. It was a convenient means to order information and perhaps, even, its early use has a parallel in the earliest English dictionaries which were arranged according to our present alphabet, but whose major purpose was the study of a foreign language. For  the English, it was Latin; for the Japanese, it was Sanskrit. (Author/AMM)",

McKaughan's article &quot;Language Materials Development&quot; (Philippine Journal for Language Teaching; v2 n1-2 1969), reports on a project at the Pacific and Asian Linguistic Institute (PALI) of the University of Hawaii to develop a set of materials for seven Philippine languages: Bikol, Cebuano, Hiligaynon, Ilokano, Kapampangan, Pangasinan, and Tagalog. The following materials were developed for each of the languages: (1) lessons for about 300 hours of intensive conversational classroom instruction; (2) a reference grammar suitable for the layman, presenting the structure in concise form; (3) a learner's dictionary. The materials are intended both for classroom use and for self help after the intensive course has been completed. Materials were developed  under the general rationale provided by the project director, but individual authors were allowed to exercise independent judgment in the development of specific materials. This report indicates the authors and titles of the specific materials developed and then presents the introduction to the Kapampangan text with a sample lesson, in order to illustrate the pedagogical approach used for the teaching of one of the languages. These materials are not presently available to the public but the entire set is eventually to appear in the Pali Language Text Series (University of Hawaii Press). (FWB)",

The SDS is a self-administered, self-scored and self-interpreted vocational counseling tool which contains an assessment booklet and a classification booklet, both of which are products of a theory of personality types and environmental models. The development of the SDS is summarized. An informed evaluation based on the use of the SDS with 5,000 widely divergent subjects suggests that: (1) 50% of those taking it like it; (2) others are troubled by the results  and could use couseling; (3) the SDS is applicable to a wide age range; and (4) the SDS has the desirable characteristics of immediacy, self-direction, completeness, independence, personal development and safeguards. The conclusion suggests some beneficial side-effects of the SDS. (TL)",

All applications were identical except for the race, sex and ability levels of the applicants. The procedure used for preparing the applications is discussed. The authors predicted that blacks would be preferred to whites, and males to females, other things being equal. The main dependent variable was an applicant's acceptance or rejection, but other measures were collected: (1) the time which elapsed between a request for application materials and the school's response; (2) the nature of the reply; and (3) the time between mailing the application and the school's decision. The relationships between additional variables and patterns of admission were explored by analyzing the size, type and  regional location of the schools. Results showed that neither the race nor sex main effect was significant. However, contrary to the authors' expectations, blacks were accepted less frequently than whites. As expected, males were preferred over females, but this occurred primarily at the low ability level. No other significant correlations were attained. (TL)",

The stress placed on professionalism and the acquisition of academic degrees in selection procedures in the United States is viewed as impairing the development and expansion of programs.

A multitude of factors and interacting clusters of variables that influence the counseling process with these persons are identified: (1) the negative, resistive attitude or, at least, the unenthusiatic and guarded orientation; (2) the usually alien and unfamiliar qualities (to the disadvantaged client) of agencies; (3) the social, cultural, educational and emotional gaps between the middle-class counselor, black or white, and his disadvantaged client; and (4) the foreign quality of a verbal, interpersonal model of transaction. Suggestions for  improving counselor effectiveness with the disabled disadvantaged are offered: (1) minimizing the effects of unfamiliar settings and procedures; and (2) altering the counselor's basic orientation where style, content, goals, and evaluation are concerned. Qualities of counselors who would work most effectively with these clients are delineated. In conclusion, the author notes that the above efforts would have an ameliorative effect, but that only significant social, economic and political changes will truly alter the condition of the disabled disadvantaged.

Nine hundred and fifty-one retardates, ages 18-68, were rated by psychiatric aides in two midewestern state institutions. The BC TRY System of Cluster and Factor Analysis identified seven distinct sub-groups of individuals with similar score profiles on the two dimensions. A cross tabulation of individuals in terms of the American Association on Mental  Deficiency etiological classifications and the seven sub-groupings was carried out. Conclusions indicated trends which suggest a possible relation between the behavioral typology and etiological classifications.

Dr. Gantz's paper deals with the last two of these components. His particular vantage point was the value dilemmas which arise in identifying and developing creative leaders.

The test is rooted in a theoretical framework, which conceives of five constituents of motivation to achieve: (1) affective; (2) conceptual; (3) purposive; (4) cognitive; and (5) evaluative. Factor analysis and a type of cluster analysis were applied in order to judge the adequacy of the theory with reference to the original test format. Based on these and other techniques, the format was revised and administered to 1607 preschool children in 10 ethnic-cultural samples in the United States. Appropriate group forms were administered to 668 children in the first, second and fourth grades in Hawaii. Following extensive data analysis, factors were identified for both  sample populations, some of which needed further study. Ultimately, the study is directed to deriving a better foundation for teaching motivation to children at various ages and of different backgrounds. It is suggested that further research might well be based on improved techniques for clarifying substantive motivational factors. Two such techniques are discussed.

After reviewing the few studies that have analyzed natural interaction sequentially, a theoretical framework is proposed: interactors are decision makers who generate choices over time based on a memory of the recent past and an expectation of immediate future outcomes. This framework led to hypotheses about memory's size, organization, and distortion, about decision rules, and about outcome structures and value determination. The various hypotheses are partially used in formal models that represent these processes. A sample conversation is analyzed to demonstrate the models and not to draw support for the  hypotheses. Many hypotheses can be represented through this model. (KJ/Author)",

The role played by the National Association for Mental Health (NAMH) in these developments is also viewed. Individuals working in state hospitals and related institutions have capitalized on the concept of the therapeutic community, with its principle that all employees and volunteers and other patients are potential rehabilitators and, as is appropriate in their setting, have begun inservice training programs and new mental health educational programs leading, in some local settings to: (1) an Associate of Arts degree; (2) a Bachelor of Science degree; (3) a Master of Arts degree; or (4) a n entirely new rehabilitation and direct  treatment program. Through position papers supporting the above developments and conferences, NAMH has helped to further these developments by organization and communication of knowledge to others involved in the field.

Even though there is a split among behaviorists as to which procedure is best to follow, there are some special strengths of the behavioral viewpoint: (1) because it is a new method, it generates enthusiasm, hope and faith from patients; (2) because it paints a consistent picture of the etiology of all psychopathology, behaviorism obviates the need for wrestling with conflicting dynamic or biological views of the case; (3) diagnosis is linked with treatment, and achievement of goals and depends on a problem solving diagnostic laboratory; and (4)  because of this laboratory method, behaviorists are very receptive to research. Limitations of behaviorism include: (1) one procedure cannot cure all ailments; and (2) behavioral procedures have not been useful in treatment of schizophrenia or other functional psychoses. (KJ)",

A brief discussion of basic theoretical assumptions is included. In behavioral counseling, the relationship can best be characterized as collaboration, and unlike non-behaviorists, the behavioral counselor can assist his client to acquire the needed skills necessary to function more adaptively in his surroundings. In the assessment process, behavioral counseling, in contrast to traditional techniques, is data oriented in that it provides a baseline against which both client and counselor can evaluate the effectiveness of their efforts toward change and can decide on the methods which work best. Behaviorists then direct their attention to the antecedent events in  the environment which may have served as cues for the problem behavior. Based on this analysis, the client and counselor can plan specific changes in the environment. The final step is the evaluation of the therapeutic effectiveness by observing changes in the rate of the target behavior. (KJ)",

This position paper reasons, therefore, that white students and professional personnel are likely to be racist. Individual racism and institutional racism victimize black and white people and retard their adjustment and progress. Systems are interrelated and interdependent, they affect each other. Individuals affect systems and systems affect individuals. In determining possibilities for change, we have looked at fragments of black and white behavior as they might exist in the university system. As a general implication, counselors and other professional personnel must make commitments in the form of action in changing themselves and in changing the university.

The simplest analysis of memory is to divide the process into two parts: storage and retrieval. Studies show that the limitation of memory lies primarily in retrieval rather than storage. Organization represents a retrieval plan or rule to provide a set of cues. From this approach, there are at least two possible sources of adult age differences in retrieval processes: (1) differences in the quantity and quality of the information contained in the retrieval plan; and (2) differences in the availability of the retrieval plan at recall.

The general hypothesis is: the level of aspiration of a patient is positively associated with his socialization (his rehabilitation) outcome. Subjects were 105 patients with spinal cord injuries or amputations. The two aspects of socialization considered in the study are physical functions and attitudinal adjustment. These variables, along with social interaction and aspiration were measured using a variety of techniques and instruments. Results showed: (1) aspiration does have a clear effect on a patient's rehabilitation as measured by level of physical function and as measured by attitudinal adjustment; (2) aspiration is predictive of improvement in physical function and attitudinal adjustment; and  (3) a specific goal which is valued by the individual, significant others and the larger society positively affects socialization.

The term \"therapy\" is now being dropped and small groups are becoming a new, here-to-stay, soial institution. The need for an open, safe vehicle for self-expression is viewed as primary in this age of alienation. Hence, the small group's wide-spread value is of great importance. Throughout the paper, numerous implicit or explicit reasons for the importance of the small group as a solution to social functioning problems are presented. Implications of the small group approach for the therapist are discussed. Various dilemmas concerning the nature and extent of therapist participation are addressed.  Mowrer also states his case for a balanced approach to personality problems which include not only a social dislocation etiology (treated best in groups), but also a possible biochemical basis. In summary, the paper argues that peer groups (specifically defined) and medication offer the best sources of therapy for human beings. Cautions in their use are emphasized. (TL)",

The Ss were 108 white, middle and lower class pre-school, first and third grade children. Two measures of receptive vocabulary were administered as background language measures. The experimental task required S to sort pictures of common objects into categories at three levels of task difficulty. The results indicated a rather marked decline in spontaneous verbalization from the pre-school to first grade levels with no significant change between the first and third grade levels. A parallel trend was found in the decreasing intensity level of the speech productions (i.e., a simultaneous decrease in overt vocalization and increase in silent lip-movement  activity). These findings support Vygotsky's internalization hypothesis. A significant association was not found between the frequency of verbalization and problem solving performance, which casts doubt on the directive function of such verbal activity. Prominant social class differences in cognitive-linguistic abilities were also found. These differences may stem from the differential linguistic codes attributed to the middle and lower class patterns of verbal interaction. (Author/CJ)",

Information regarding the participant's level of cognitive functioning was obtained by administration of Schroder's Paragraph Completion Test, at the opening and at the closing of the laboratory. Assessment of the \"match\" between the participant's needs and the complexity of the learning environment was made by use of a  questionnaire especially prepared for the purpose. Findings were consistent with the first two hypotheses. However, contrary to expectations, the relation was curvilinear rather than linear. Conditions necessary for testing the third hypothesis were not met in the study - when participants were grouped by pre-training level of cognitive structure the match between needs and learning environment was no better for one group than for another. Possible explanations for the curvilinear relation are offered. (Author/CJ)",

Subjects learned eight-pair lists of familiar nouns in a standard paired-associates task. Each subject learned two lists, one presented visually and the other, aurally. Performance on the visual task was superior to that on the aural task, and subjects in higher grades performed better than those in lower grades. Overall, the middle-class subjects' performance was superior to that of the disadvantaged children, but there was a complex interaction indicating that there were no differences between these groups at the fourth- and sixth-grade levels. Discrepancies in reading ability and in motivational set were discussed as to their  possible relevance in interpreting the data. (Author)",

Some evident outcomes were: (a) when teenagers are involved, constructive projects can be developed to help them identify with their community (Plans 1 and 2); (b) teachers  can become better able to help students understand their environment through these study plans, particularly Plan 1; (c) when students, townspeople and young people have an opportunity to come together, there is a positive change in school community relationships; and (d) by analyzing personal interactions a basis can be found for curriculum materials focusing on key problems to be considered in environmental problem solving.

        "description":"The major focus of this study is on the relationship between anxiety and achievement. It was predicted that with young children, anxiety is likely to have a debilitating effect on their standardized test scores as well as on teachers' ratings of their competence. This hypothesis is generally supported. The sample consists of 156 childen from preschool, kindergarten, and first grade. Results of testing and observation show negative correlations between the anxiety questionnaire and competence ratings for kindergarten children, and no relationship at all between perceived anxiety and achievement for the first grade sample, although anxiety ratings do show a significant negative correlation with achievement. This fact may be attributable to first grade children being more defensive  than kindergarteners. Anxiety seems to show no relationship to achievement motivation for kindergarten children, but a positive relationship for first graders. For preschoolers it is found that achievement motivation reflects a concern about success, and may be viewed as a form of anxiety. Results suggest that concern about success and failure is more apt to be part of a general anxiety for the older children, particularly for girls, reflecting the fact that competition is generally less acceptable for girls than boys in our society.

This area was chosen because: (1) a philosophical criticism of verbal learning theory will contribute to the difficult task of investigating the border area between philosophy and psychology; and (2) no one theory has yet emerged as pre-eminent so that the difficulties of handling competing theories are not existent. While no \"theory\" has yet been produced three general positions have emerged: gestaltism, functional associationism, and transformational linguistics. Discussed are: (1) some of the grounds for suspecting that the theory-dependency thesis holds for verbal learning theory; (2) that theoretical terms must be ultimately definable  in terms of operations describable in some theory-neutral observation language; (3) some of the criticisms of operationalism to the more general question of whether there can be a theory-neutral observation language at all; and (4) details of the controversy between Skinner for the associationists and Chomsky for the transformational linguists.

Specialist personnel may be required and without them it is doubtful if full benefit can be obtained either from the planning process or from the implementation of plans once developed.

It cannot be left to the \"backroom boys\" nor can it be done for a school system by an outside body such as a university. These and other agencies have roles to play, but planning and policy development must be more than a bookish exercise. If school systems adopt a planning outlook involving as many personnel as possible  they can develop \"rolling reform\" which will enable schools to become more vital institutions in meeting the challenges of today and tomorrow.

The organization of these experimental middle schools embraced subschools, educational planning teams, departmentalization, and independent pupil study. Using the results from standardized achievement tests, an attitude inventory, a semantic differential, questionnaires, extended observation by consultants, and interviews, the research team compared middle school pupils with junior high pupils in the areas of mathematics achievement,  attitudes toward school, and self-concept. The only statistically significant differences (analysis of variance) showed that junior high pupils performed better in arithmetic problem solving, while intermediate school boys had more favorable attitudes toward social studies and science.

        "description":"Non-public school enrollment in Massachusetts --19.1 percent-- has always been among the nation's highest, with the majority of these students enrolled in Catholic schools. The rising cost of education and a decreasing supply of non-lay teachers are placing economic burdens on the Catholic schools, causing some to close and others to be phased out. The effect of this phasing out, in terms of tax rate increase, is estimated for all towns and cities in Massachusetts where Catholic schools presently exist. The purpose of this study is to measure how much public budgets save by the existence of the Catholic school system. The design of the study and tables showing the data are included.

        "description":"Since the major activity of the school is the development of students into productive adults, decisions in school management should enhance the processes that facilitate development of the child. Rational decisionmaking in school management necessitates coordination between school boards and school administrators. Boards of education must determine their systems' goals and available resources. Administrators then must assess the achievement of students in relation to these goals and recommend alternative strategies for needs not being met. In such a model of decisionmaking, feedback is crucial to the rationality of the decisions. To accrue appropriate feedback, school managers should determine gains made by students under their jurisdictions. This measurement of gain can be made  only by ascertaining the differences in achievement at two time periods, rather than by comparing achievement results with some national standard. Collection and analysis of a variety of information allows administrators to proliferate subgroups and to determine the educational shortcomings of each subgroup.

This system, designed to aid in elementary mathematics curriculum planning and implementation, was offered cost free to school districts; however, almost 90 percent of the invited districts chose not to participate. Focusing on the decision-making process in school districts, this study attempted to discover factors responsible for the large rejection rate. The main finding was that acceptance or rejection of the project was based largely on the degree of familiarity with the project. Administrators most likely to reject the project were those who had received little or no information about  it.

It also underscores the importance of interaction among all the major entities (school board members, administrators, teachers, and citizens) within the system if there is to be optimum commitment to decisions for improvement.

Complexity and size of organization were found to be significantly related variables, although there is no evidence to support the notion that the administrative ratio is linearly related to either of the two organizational variables. Four areas of speculation are considered: irrationality in organization, \"administrative style,\" wealth of the system, and Blau's \"Formal Theory of Differentiation in Organizations.\" However, the determination of the exact form of the relationship among the three variables of administrative component size, complexity, and  size of organization is still unexplained. It seems logical, however, that the next step in the accumulation of empirical knowledge would concern this growth relationship. (Author)",

Eighty first, second, and third graders, identified as having such handicaps by gross and fine screening instruments, were randomly divided into experimental and control groups. For 1/2 hour per day for six months, training exercises and activities were conducted in the following categories: ocular motor, movement skills, laterality and directionality, spatial judgments, eye-hand coordination, and visualization. Post-tests administered were the Fine Screening Instrument, Lorge-Thorndike IQ Test, Gates-McGinitie Reading Test, and Stanford Achievement Test. The IQ and  Achievement Tests showed no gains of the experimental group over the control group. But the fine screening results showed more improvement in visual-motor-perceptual functioning by the experimental group, and anecdotal records by classroom teachers reported progress by nearly all the experimental students.

Questionnaires were sent the 205 purchasers of the film; response indicated that there is considerable doubt that the target audience (black youth) is being reached in any substantial way. Of 138 teachers who were sent questionnaires, only 37 responded; of these, only 10 used the film for affective purposes. Consultants, viewing the film, felt that blacks would definitely shift in the direction of greater self-esteem as a result of seeing the film. Experimental findings of audience effects done in the seventh and eighth grades of four schools suggest that the present film did not have  an effect on the self-concepts of the students participating in the study; but that most students, regardless of sex and race, tended to identify with the young black hero. It is recommended that the new film should be dramatic, should have a black hero and a black heroine, and should emphasize personal values. A definite effort should be made to insure that the film does reach its intended audience. Appendices include a selected ERIC bibliography concerning Negro self-image. (MF)",

The higher institutions selected as the population sample were the University of Southern California, Michigan State University, Syracuse University, and Indiana University. Information was gathered from catalog listings , course syllabi, promotional brochures, and student handouts, as well as from a written questionnaire sent to randomly selected students, graduates, and staff. Recommendations were sought from scholars, innovators, and philosophers in the field. The related literature was reviewed. The result of the information-gathering process was an in-depth view of the  process of doctoral education in instructional technology as it exists today and a set of guidelines for improving this process in the future.

One reason for this is an inadequate understanding of the process of research utilization. Scattered studies of research utilization have occurred, but suffer from a lack of integration. Among propositions that may be postulated to attempt such an integration are these: (1) communication between the research system and client system is facilitated by a linking system; (2) communication of research results and/or client needs between a research system and a linking system is facilitated by the degree of homophily between researchers and linkers; and (3) the linking system depends upon homophily between researchers and linkers and between linkers and clients and  the use of opinion leaders to bridge the heterophily gap. Research utilization may be improved by increasing the technical competence of clients, by attention to client feedback, by training organization managers to manage change, and by orientation of research to needs of practitioners. Further research is needed to determine the ideal structure for research utilization in vocational rehabilitation. Consolidation of vocational rehabilitation researchers in a small number of mission-oriented centers might be advisable. (MF)",

In order to test this theory, five treatment groups were established. All groups were pretested, taught the same unit of instruction, and posttested. Four groups saw slide sequences in which were viewed illustrations with a different degree of realism: line drawing (black and white), line drawing (color), shaded drawing (black and white), and a shaded drawing (color). The fifth group saw a slide presentation with words only. The results of the study showed no significant difference among the five groups in learning achievement.

Behavioral objectives were determined through consultation with various interested personnel, including the staff of the Vocational Training Annex at the Austin State School and the staff of the Mary Lee School of Special Education. After determining subskills by task analysis, it was determined that the ability to identify the denominations of coins and to know the proper value of each was a necessary minimal entering behavior. The IBM 1500-1800 computer system was chosen for its reliability and sophisticated terminals. A metal overlay keyboard was designed containing ten oversize keys;  this allowed actual coins to be placed on the keys. Thirty-eight subjects were used, ranging in age from 12 to 30 and in IQ from 45 to 80; 21 students completed all parts of the course. Every student who completed the course improved his score from pre- to posttest, and retention appeared to be substantial. Student responses were studied as the basis for future revisions. CAI can be used successfully with the mentally retarded student; the question remaining is whether time and money should be invested in this approach. (MF)",

        "description":"The problems and successes of instructional television (ITV) in elementary and secondary schools in New York State between 1966-68 are reported here as the basis for recommendations which may facilitate the continued development of ITV in the state. Sixty-five schools, representing 60 percent of the ITV-using schools, and nine nonusing ITV schools in the State were visited. Educational Council Stations were found to be the single greatest source of programs; these were mostly used as enrichment or resource materials. Problems most often mentioned were those of scheduling and programing. With the initial help of the State assistance program, most of the schools seem to have most of the equipment they need. Generally, all buildings are considered adequate for ITV. Teachers report  that they feel comfortable with ITV. However, budget cuts may make the suspension rate of ITV as high as 25 percent for the 1969-70 school year. Some of the recommendations are that the development of Council stations, Instructional Television Fixed Service Stations, and closed-circuit television school systems in New York State should be coordinated; that the State Education Department videotape library should be expanded; and that ITV preservice and inservice training programs for teachers and school administrators should be developed.

Yet, in the developing countries, no other aspect of modern communications has so much interested the planners as the possibility of using broadcast satellites for educational purposes. India and Brazil, with large land areas, have been especially enthusiastic. Problems to be met in the developing countries include: illiteracy, shortage of vocational and technical skills, the level of agricultural skills, community development, public  health, population control, national and international awareness, delivery of education to remote areas, and the need for capable teachers. Primary among the requirements for successful exploitation of satellite television is the existence of at least the beginning of an educational system and the maintenance of hardware for good transmission. An important consideration of the foreign policy of the United States should be the development of the most effective means of assisting other countries to participate in satellite programs. (MF)",

Color deficiencies of two types--deuternopia (green blindness) and protanopia (red blindness)--were represented by six children each in the experiment. With six color normals, they were paid to discriminate the orientation of the gap in chromatic rings presented on chromatic surrounds.  The degrees of hue contrast in Part I of the study were 36, 72, 108, 144, and 180 on the Munsell Hue Circle. The illuminant intensities were 25, 50, 75, and 100 footcandles. Viewing distance was 3 meters. Brightness contrast in Part II of the study had four values between 30 and 80 percent. Illuminant intensity was 50 footcandles, and viewing distances were 5, 6, 7, and 8 meters. On the evidence of the study the recommendation is that a brightness contrast of 30 percent or more be provided in colored instructional materials. (MF)",

A major problem was to maintain a suitable balance of author direction, teacher guidance, and student initiative. Materials offered the students were a set of objectives; a set of sample test questions; a study guide referencing films, audio tapes, lectures, textbook chapters, and journal articles; a programing language; and a set of quizzes and other learning exercises which could be used in booklet form or on a computer system. Most of the learning materials for the course were available in a room set aside for quiet study or small group discussion. Revision of the procedures and materials of the  curriculum was continuous throughout the trial sessions, using data on student performance and attitude whenever possible to bring all students to a satisfactory level of achievement. A programing language, FORTRAN (Formula Translating System), and several instructional strategies were implemented for an IBM 360 time-sharing system. It is thought that the experience of this study is applicable to inexpensive curriculum development for self-instruction projects at university level.

The State is advised to contract with communications consultants to help it save money on its telephone bill. It is also advised to set up a management organization to integrate its telecommunications facilities. Computerization of portions of the management function is recommended. Nine telecommunication approaches that the State may take are considered; of these, five are costed in detail and are the basis for the development of seven competing telecommunications plans. The highest cost plan is 35 percent higher in cost than the lowest cost system; but cost  is not thought to be the only consideration. It is concluded that although the state-owned and leased administrative networks are at least 45 percent more expensive than the common carrier network, they provide greater reliability and survivability. It is recommended that the State should buy more equipment and use the new frequencies, but that no extensive replacement of equipment should be made at this time.

They are: continuation of present policies, satellite-to-home broadcasting, and cable distribution of television. Trends noted are: the growth of commercial UHF (Ultra High Frequency) stations, the introduction of all-channel sets, population growth, increase in network revenue and expenses, and unchanging amount of local programing, the growth of Community Antenna Television (CATV), program origination by local CATV systems, and the concentration of control within the television industry. The prospects for wider diversity in television programs are mixed. At present, educational television contributes to this diversity. Pay television may also contribute, but is apt to encounter  regulatory and economic problems. In the future, video tapes and video records will reach selective audiences in the way that books do. Satellite-to-home broadcasting offers a glamorous alternative for distributing television, but does not seem to offer program diversity. Cable television, or the wired city, may increase program diversity, depending upon its sources of support and the types of organizations that will make programs available. (MF)",

For SPIRES II, the goals are related to five areas: data source and content, cost and customers, search  facilities, feedback, and record modification. The work of SPIRES and BALLOTS has potential beyond its immediate applications. It can support socially significant research, as in the fields of ecology and urban studies; and with remote terminals, it can provide information quickly and at the sit e of research.

Interconnection with other mid-Peninsula cable television systems is desirable, not only for reasons of economy, but also for the opportunity of reaching larger audiences with Stanford originated material. At least 10 percent of the channels of the cable system should be reserved for educational and instructional program origination by local educational institutions, including Stanford. A minimum of 24 channels should be provided, with provision for increasing the number of channels, if needed. Innovative  opportunities include low-cost videotaping of seminars, extended language laboratory capability, dial-access information systems, access to educational video cassettes, and computer-aided instruction. Experimental instructional service could be offered on an open enrollment basis to the surrounding community, expanding the potential for lifelong learning.

Another experiment involving a class of 15 students, tested for linguistic proficiency in English and taught idioms and figures of speech for six weeks through various innovative approaches, is examined.
