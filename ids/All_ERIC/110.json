        "description":"A study was conducted of the factors affecting the utilization of educational television in elementary and secondary schools in the 127 school districts in the state of Alabama. Based upon the results of previous studies, five variables were investigated: (1) percentage of K-12 students in the total student population, (2) ratio of students to videotape recorders, (3) ratio of students to television receivers, (4) ratio of students to color television receivers, and (5) student population within individual districts. A questionnaire was used to gather information pertaining to the five variables, as well as to the percentage of students utilizing instructional television. The effects of each of the variables studied were measured by means of stepwise multiple regression.  Scheduling was found to be the most important variable affecting the use of educational television in instruction. Further study using a wider range of variables, specifically curricula variables, was recommended. A review of the literature on the use of educational television in instruction, a 14-item bibliography, and two tables accompany the report. (Author/JL)",

        "description":"During the past two decades, community colleges have vigorously pursued the expansion of mission and clientele. However, resulting increases in student numbers, services, and facilities have not been matched by additional local, state, and federal revenues. This tension between continuing expansion and available resources, along with increased public concern for academic standards, high rates of attrition, and limited transfer rates have caused many administrators to search for more efficient ways of accomplishing current activities and to rely upon technological solutions. Instead, they should evaluate the relevance of their activities to a changing external environment and alter practices where necessary to preserve institutional integrity. In the next decade, educational  leaders will need to address three key issues: (1) an increasing incompatibility and tension between adult education and community service missions and transfer and occupational education missions; (2) problems of defining, measuring, and maintaining educational quality given fixed or declining resources; and (3) an increasing faculty unwillingness to commit themselves to administratively defined priorities when their chances of success as teachers are declining. These issues center on institutional integrity and quality rather than institutional diversity and quantity, and require the establishment of and commitment to community-based priorities. (HB)",

Part I of the report summarizes the state's goals for postsecondary education, reviews past policies for achieving these goals, and outlines future options in a time of financial constraint. Part II presents six recommendations and the principles upon which they are based for maintaining access, high quality, and equitable student charges through explicitly defined state policies and shared individual and public support for postsecondary education. Part III offers four recommendations in response to the legislature's concerns about the distribution of financial aid to students, the use of revenues from student  charges, and the impact of student charges on the roles and missions of the segments of the postsecondary system within the state's master plan. Part IV provides a brief conclusion pointing out the strengths and limitations of the recommendations.

Using an approach that draws upon the talent and expertise of faculty members in departments and divisions throughout the college, the International Education Program has made significant strides toward internationalizing the curriculum, promoting overseas study, serving foreign students, and fostering faculty development. Illustrating BCC's commitment to providing students with an understanding of other societies and cultures is a general education requirement for all associate in arts students to complete six semester hours in courses that  contain major international content and emphasis. Among the components of the international program are: (1) an International Curriculum Project, which involves the development of new courses and resource materials and the expansion of foreign language instruction; (2) study abroad programs, such as the Semester-in-Spain program and summer travel-study courses; (3) the establishment of the position of International Student Coordinator to help meet the needs of the 400 foreign students at BCC; (4) affiliation with national and state organizations that promote international education; and (5) faculty development and teacher exchange programs. Through such activities BCC is meeting its commitment to providing students with a critical international/intercultural understanding. (HB)",

        "description":"On January 1, 1980, the Illinois state legislature mandated tenure for community college faculty and established conditions under which tenure could be acquired and reasons and procedures for dismissal. One provision of the act precluded the dismissal of a tenured faculty member who was &quot;competent to render&quot; services carried out by an employee with less seniority. This provision failed to define the phrase &quot;competent to render&quot; services and caused fears that faculty could be bumped from their positions on a college-wide, rather than departmental, basis. To deal with these issues, the Illinois Valley Community College (IVCC) Board of Trustees developed policies that (1) defined the master's degree as the basic standard for teaching in a particular subject area; (2) distinguished  academic personnel from academic support personnel; (3) provided for the preparation of a list of the competencies and qualifications of all full-time faculty and support personnel and for the development of a &quot;Minimum Qualifications Handbook&quot; for faculty and support positions; and (4) determined that movement of personnel would occur only in times of staff reduction. The outcomes of these policies have benefitted faculty and the administration in that the Board of Trustees is now protected by a formal policy on tenure and academic qualifications and that the faculty now have clearly defined competency agreements specifying the areas in which they are qualified to render services.

        "description":"In 1980, Vista College (a non-campus, public community college where part-time faculty teach 85% of the courses) received funding to develop an effective faculty development model for part-time instructors in postsecondary institutions. The project was designed to break down the isolation of part-time faculty, encourage a sense of college and faculty identity, and provide instructional and administrative support. After an analysis of existing activities and part-time faculty needs, four types of services and procedures were developed and pilot-tested: (1) audiovisual orientation materials and an expanded faculty handbook were developed to introduce part-time instructors to college services, resources, staff, programs, and procedures; (2) a variety of training seminars and  workshops were offered and bi-weekly faculty support sessions were held; (3) a monthly faculty journal was produced emphasizing teaching and learning concerns; and (4) peer Teaching and Learning Consultants were selected and trained to provide aid and advisement to faculty. The project's first-year goals also included the modification of faculty evaluation procedures; however, this aspect of the project was eliminated in light of standardized evaluation procedures for the district. To assess the outcomes of the project five kinds of evaluation strategies were used to gather formative data about the project services and products, revealing strong faculty support for the program.

Separate examinations were offered to native English speakers (i.e., the Stanford Achievement Test) and those whose primary language was not English (i.e., the English Placement Test of the University of Michigan). Of the 5,500 students who took the College Placement Examination in fall 1981, 2,423 (44%) elected to take the test for native English speakers, and 3,077 (56%) selected the English as a Second Language (ESL) test. On the basis of test scores placement was recommended in 1 of 11 developmental courses or a college-level English course, in which placement was confirmed by a writing sample. Highlights of study findings include the  following: (1) 64% of the students taking the test spoke a language other than English as their native language; (2) a greater percentage of students elected the ESL test in 1981 than in 1980 (56% vs. 43%); (3) the largest ethnic group was Hispanic (29%), followed by Asian (26%); (4) 55% of the students had attended college prior to taking the examination; (5) 47% of the native group and 12% of the ESL group were placed in the college-level English course, representing about 28% of the total sample; (6) 30% of the native group and 44% of the ESL group were recommended for a Developmental Communications course, representing 38% of the sample; and (7) 59.1% of the ESL students were attending LACC to learn English.

Section I provides background information; outlines project objectives, which include the training of professional teachers for the elderly and of a group of older adults who serve as learning companions to the homebound elderly; and describes the project setting. After Section II introduces project staff, Section III describes how the project operates, i.e., older adults, designated as learning companions, enroll in courses held one day a week at convenient community locations and, between class meetings, they visit shut-ins to share class content. This  section also explains the methods used to evaluate the project and that the subject, teacher, social agency, and course site were the factors considered most important to the success and value of the course to students. In Section IV, outcomes, information, and evaluative findings are presented based on teacher reports, student responses and comments, and an examination of the value of the peer teaching method in nursing homes and hospitals for the aged. Section V discusses the implications of the findings and the problems encountered. Finally, Section VI considers the significance of the project and offers recommendations. Extensive appendices include course lists, program guidelines, and materials that were developed. (HB)",

For the first project component, non-sequenced, single-concept lessons geared to the cognitive, affective, and action characteristics of preschool children were produced. The lessons were taught initially to approximately 100 preschool children in a laboratory school and then were field-tested in 20 private preschool classrooms. An assessment instrument, the Northridge Survey of Understanding Nutrition - Preschool Level, was developed to measure outcomes of the educational intervention. To meet the objectives of the project's second component, in-service training emphasizing the  recognition and application of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and comprehension of the concept of high nutrient density was provided to staff of participating preschools. Project activities in the third component area focused on the development of six instructional modules, a teacher's guide, and coordinated materials for use by young children, staff and parents in group and home settings. For the fourth component, family/community education activities were conducted. Throughout the report, research and development activities and outcomes are reported in detail.

The 16-week long program, providing a total of 40 hours of training, covered a wide range of topics in addition to the initial workshops on assertiveness. Human sexuality, parenting skills, relaxation techniques, positive thinking, and community resources (e.g., law, housing, credit) were among the topics discussed. Basically, the original goals of the training were that participants would (1) gain a positive self-image, (2) recognize the alternatives available to them, (3) be able to express their needs and feelings to others, (4) take advantage of resources at their  disposal, (5) implement in their own homes positive actions that would influence their children, and (6) acquire problem-solving skills that would enable them to make decisions and accept responsibility for their choices. Designed with other single mothers in mind and to include input from parents participating in the training program, contents of this handbook are organized under six topic headings: Being Assertive, Relaxing, Parenting, Being Positive, Sexuality, and Law/Your Rights. Each of the six brief articles provide suggestions, recommendations, and basic concepts, and are accompanied by photographs of mothers participating in the training and with their children. (RH)",

        "description":"Divided into eight sections, this training manual describes the philosophy, activities, and materials employed by a workshop designed to help childbirth educators reduce sex-role stereotyping in their classes. The first section explains the relationships of sex-role stereotyping to childbirth education, defines the problem of stereotyping, and concludes by describing how the workshop fits into the large process of social change. Sections two and three explain the training philosophy behind the workshops, offer an overview of human relations training, relate that training to childbirth education, and finally provide a conceptual model for the skills developed in the workshop. A detailed outline of all the activities used in the the workshop model is provided in the third section.  Activities are broken down into seven modules, each of which includes, in suggested order of presentation, simulations, warm-ups, lecturettes, and structured exercises. The next four sections elaborate on the items listed in the workshop model outline. In the first of these sections, two models which simulate situations relevant to childbirth education, &quot;CESIM&quot; (Childbirth Education Simulation) and &quot;MIDSIM&quot; (Midtown Simulation), are described. The sections which follow, &quot;Lecturettes,&quot;&quot;Warm-Ups,&quot; and &quot;Structured Exercises,&quot; comprise the bulk of the workshop material. They detail the content of the workshop, the introductory activities, and participant-centered experiences. A list of books and organizations useful to persons interested in reducing sex-role stereotyping is included in the  final section of the manual. (MP)",

        "description":"A symposium addressing the needs of uprooted migrant and refugee children and the role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in meeting those needs took place at Wingspread, Racine, Wisconsin in November, 1978. Uprooted children are those migrant and refugee children who have lost their identity as the result of being forced, for socioeconomic, political, or religious reasons, to live in a foreign country. They have not absorbed the shock of the change and have not established ties in their new surroundings. Participants in the symposium were selected for their special experience with migrant children in both receiving and sending countries of Europe and North America. Participants represented governments, international and national social service agencies, and  intergovernmental agencies, such as UNICEF. One group of participants dealt with questions regarding governments -- their legislation and regulations, attitudes, understanding or lack of it, apathy, and relationship with NGOs. The second group discussed issues within the NGO world relating to experiences, activities, and programs. Both groups dealt with problems as viewed by NGOs. Contents of the symposium report describe the background to the symposium, characterize the discussions held, explore the relationship of NGOs to governmental agencies and the private sector, and list general recommendations as well as many specific recommendations for action. The brief working paper prepared for the symposium is appended. (RH)",

The prosocial programmings evaluated were &quot;Drawing Power,&quot;&quot;Play Alongs,&quot; and &quot;How to Watch TV&quot;. The primary goals of the study, as stated by NBC, were to evaluate the appeal and impact of these programmings on young children (ages 5 to 12 years), and to obtain additional ideas about prosocial programming for the 1981-82 season. Following a brief introductory overview of the study, sections II, III, and IV present the results obtained for each of the above programmings. Each section begins by describing the prosocial programming being evaluated and the particular appeal and impact of the programming addressed. This  is followed by a description of the methods used, a presentation of the results, and a short summary. Section V of the report describes pilot research, conducted by the second author as a pilot study for her doctoral dissertation, on how children think and feel about prosocial programming. The report ends with a brief general discussion of this study's findings and their importance for network Saturday morning prosocial programming. Copies of the various instruments used to collect data are included in appendices A to N. (MP)",

An overview of the work conducted by the Americans for Indian Opportunity (AIO) to aid three tribes with their self-evaluation provides information on the decision to self-evaluate, data collection, and training and technical assistance required by three different tribes. A  dialogue between AIO staff, Tribal Council, and the planning office provides a combination of questions, answers, attitudes, and misconceptions that were picked up in the process of trying to understand how planning is handled on a reservation. Common problems of government units and recommendations for solving the problem are discussed: lack of long range planning and continuity; the boom town syndrome; the danger of administering their own federal social programs; and lack of perspective and of a political power base.

        "description":"Rural social workers occupy a number of statuses, such as professional social worker, organizational employee, rural community denizen, and private citizen/family member. Different groups may assign different priorities to the tasks that workers perform. Different audiences or groups may be at odds about definitions that are used in everyday life. The fact that cycles of peak activity vary from group to group can work to the worker's advantage or can cause even greater strains. Types of intensive, short-term therapy may be theoretically sound but situationally inappropriate. In a rural setting a worker is likely to be seen as a social worker 24 hours a day. One tool for reducing role strain is the rural-based professional group, where helping professionals band together to form  support groups that are not only able to address community problems dynamically, but are also able to assist one another in ventilating frustrations and in searching for answers to practice dilemmas. Rural workers are also experimenting with old and new technologies to develop ways of moving information rather than people. Because of their relative freedom from bureaucratic constraints, techniques developed by rural workers may serve as the basis for assisting urban and suburban workers in the future. (BRR)",

        "description":"Using in-person questionnaires, 553 newcomers and 106 long-term residents were interviewed in late 1979 and early 1980 in 5 small northern California communities to explore the role of newcomers in developing the rural economy, and especially to analyze the resources emigrants bring with them: their skills, education, background, and business and financial resources. The five rural growth communities represented retirement, university/professional, government and public service, tourist, and counterculture communities. The basic theme that emerged was that rural migrants in California represented something substantially new to the state and the nation's traditional economic thinking. Migrants, rather than being attracted by new economic and employment opportunites, were a primary  source for creation of jobs and a new type of economic growth. It would seem that rural areas are no longer economically depressed and lacking in the physical and human resources necessary to participation in a growing economy, at least in California. However, most governmental policies continue to be directed toward rural areas as though they suffer serious resource deficiencies. The emerging challenge for policy makers is to fashion policies that take advantage of the growth stimulus that newcomers and growth areas provide, while ensuring that the less advantaged benefit as well.

Such changes are suggested to have taken place in response to growth in information, to changing perceptions of the nature of the physics discipline, and to a variety of other factors in the surrounding community and society. Following a review of physics enrollments and the state of physics in the late 1950's, science course improvement projects begun at this time are reviewed, including, for example, the Physical Science Study Committee Physics course, Nuffield Physics Project, Project Physics (formerly Harvard Project Physics), Berkeley Physics Course,  Intermediate Science Curriculum Study, and Man Made World. Discussions of other trends in physics address student grouping and pacing, relevance through applied science and societal issues, role of the laboratory, use of resource materials and media, role of the teacher, and the role of research on learning and development in the curriculum development process.

These deficiencies included misleading perceptual clues, bias against females, familarity with content and task, and high cost of administration and data collection. A microcomputer system for recording and measuring logical thinking ability was developed and tested in experiments designed to study: (1) the ability of subjects (N=394) to demonstrate logical thinking with two kinds of content (physical science and social-psychology); (2) patterns of logical thinking under two kinds of instruction (global and differentiated); and (3) automation of data collection. Findings from these studies indicate  that: (1) the microcomputer is a useful tool for studying logical thinking; (2) teacher-learning variables can produce significant gains at the concrete operational level for college students, but gains at the formal operational level are more difficult; and (3) successful problem solvers tend to use relatively few, but highly efficient patterns. Nine advantages (including a significant reduction of task bias against female subjects) and four disadvantages of the microcomputer system are listed and discussed. (Author/JN)",

Participants attended 32 class sessions which involved lecture, demonstration, seminars, laboratory work, and discussion. Two full-day and four half-day field trips were also part of the program. The goals of the program were to increase teachers' environmental science knowledge, to help them identify and use appropriate resource materials, and to promote cooperation between the University of Texas at Austin and teachers. Program participants also conducted inservice workshops for their own schools and school systems resulting in a multiplier effect. In order to obtain formative and summative evaluation data, program participants  responded to three instruments: one to assess teachers' concerns and changes in concerns about the inservice program, one to measure their attitudes towards science, and another to measure gains in environmental science knowledge. Instruments were administered three different times: pre-treatment, mid-way (16 weeks), and post-treatment (32 weeks). A control group was used. Findings indicate that participants' attitudes changed positively, that they demonstrated a significant increase in knowledge, and that they experienced personal growth and development. (DC)",

        "description":"To investigate factors which could explain the unequal participation and performance of males and females in science, the limited opportunity for females to acquire scientific literacy from their male peers in school was examined. It was assumed that males are more scientifically literate than females (even at elementary school age), that most peer learning results from same-sex as opposed to cross-sex interaction, and that cross-sex group work for science projects would increase female scientific literacy. Fourth- and fifth-grade students from 29 classrooms in California and Connecticut completed three pretests in the fall of 1980: classroom sociometric, attitude survey, and problem solving task completed once individually and once by a four person mixed-sex group. Posttests  were administered the following spring. Researchers observed each classroom eight times, focusing each time on three boys and three girls randomly selected. Test results and observations were used to assess classroom organization, extent of cross-sex cooperation, willingness to participate in cross-sex interaction, and sex bias/sex stereotyping. Findings indicated that opportunities for peer learning in general and cross-sex peer learning in particular were few, students were not receptive to cross-sex grouping, and that more peer learning opportunities existed in collaborative than in non-collaborative classrooms.

Controlled evaluation studies of the Elementary Science Study (ESS), Science-A Process Approach (SAPA), or The Science Curriculum Improvement Study (SCIS) were used to examine effects on student outcomes and effects on classroom practices. For the effects on student outcomes, a meta-analysis of 57 studies resulted in 400 separate comparisons involving 13,000 students from 1,000 classrooms. An average improvement of 20 percentile units on science process tests for students in activity-based programs over those in other programs was found. This improvement was significantly greater for disadvantaged  students and less for advantaged students. Effects on classroom practices were synthesized from 12 studies in which teaching practices were systematically observed during 1,800 science lessons presented in activity-based and non-activity-based classrooms. Results indicate that, on the average, the use of student hands-on activities increased by nearly 10% in the classrooms of the new programs. Talk decreased by 9% and lecturing by 7%. (DC)",

        "description":"Congress, as part of the Fiscal Year 1981 National Science Foundation Authorization Act (Public Law 96-516), called for the Director of the National Science Foundation to transmit to the Congress and certain Federal agencies a biennial statistical report on the participation of women and minorities in science and engineering employment and training. This report responds to the Congressional directive. Chapter 1, a descriptive overview of the participation of women and minorities in the natural and social sciences and engineering, highlights differences in employment patterns between women and men and between whites and racial minorities. Chapter 2 reviews a series of indicators, such as unemployment rates and salary differentials, to assess relative labor market conditions for  scientists and engineers. Chapter 3 examines the acquisition of science and engineering (S/E) skills. Data are presented on the number and proportion of women and minorities earning S/E degrees and on the acquisition of mathematics and scientific skills by women and racial minorities prior to college entry. Statistics indicate that although employment of female and minority scientists and engineers increased between 1974 and 1978, women and blacks are still underrepresented than males and whites respectively.

Data for over 1300 students in grade 5 using the mathematics subscales from the National Longitudinal Study of Mathematical Abilities (NLSMA) were analyzed. Results indicated that Bloom's taxonomy is weakly supported when a full model using both adjacent and non-adjacent paths (from path analysis) is examined. The factor analysis produced one factor, as Bloom's structure would dictate, but when the four factors accounting for the largest percentage of variance are examined, a factor structure was obtained which corresponded to only two factors that could be named, computation and problem solving. Analyses using the computer program LISREL  IV, which accounts for large error components and sample sizes, supported Bloom's cumulative hierarchy. (MNS)",

Relationships of a learner's prior knowledge and cognitive development to (1) the ability to construct concept maps and (2) the knowledge of environmental concepts as a result of using self-constructed concept maps were investigated. A secondary purpose was to compare three versions of concept mapping. Students (N=114) taking an introductory natural resources course at The Ohio State University were divided into high and low prior knowledge groups based upon pretest results. Within each group, learners were  randomly assigned to one of three concept mapping groups: (1) hierarchical-propositional; (2) hierarchical; and (3) propositional. Each student constructed three assigned maps of environmental concepts during the course and completed a posttest on these concepts and an attitude instrument at the end of the course. Findings indicate that prior knowledge, cognitive development, and reasoning ability showed little relationship to students' concept mapping performance. For two groups, prior knowledge explained more variability in posttest scores than did cognitive development. (Author/DC)",

Daily measurement of variables is characteristic of the data collection procedure in the time-series design, where individual student data are collapsed into a group mean and treated during analysis as a single subject. Data were collected for 56 school days from 95 earth science students studying a unit on plate tetonics. To determine if the design would discriminate between formal and concrete operational students (identified by Lawson's Test of Formal Reasoning), each student responded daily to a single multiple-choice item (obtained  from a pool of 78 items) measuring knowledge or understanding achievement. Two parallel forms (KR20=0.80) of a multiple-choice achievement test (consisting of 45 items) were also designed from the pool of 78 items. General knowledge and understanding achievement scores for each day were obtained and analyzed, indicating the precision of the design to discriminate between students differing in cognitive ability and supporting its use in monitoring the daily acquisition of knowledge related to a concept. Results also support the validity of the design for obtaining achievement data. (JN)",

        "description":"This project examined science education research relating to relative effects of different science programs, teaching systems, instructional methodologies, teacher preparation programs, and relationships between various student outcomes and student/teacher relationships. More than 80 studies were examined providing information on sex-related differences in pre-college science. Throughout these years, males on the average outperform females in science achievement. On the surface, these sex differences seem small (little more than a tenth of a standard deviation at the senior high level). However, when cognitive outcome differences are broken down by cognitive process levels and by specific science disciplines, some differences are considerably larger. At the higher cognitive  levels, the difference favoring senior high school males is as high as a fifth of a standard deviation. In the physical sciences, the male advantage is as high as a third of a standard deviation. Thus, with respect to important stepping stones to post-secondary programs and ultimately careers in science, women are at a disadvantage, not because of statistically significant differences between the sexes, but rather because of the educationally significant magnitudes of those differences. Problems encountered in studies of sex differences in mathematics education are also addressed. (Author/JN)",

Objectives are to help the student read history, exercise empathy, think critically, stimulate interest in the study of women, and understand the dignity and fascination of the Mexican heritage. Unit one focuses on what Aztecs believed a woman had to do and be to be considered good or bad. Unit two deals with what Spanish, Moorish, Indian, and Black women were actually doing in the 16th century in Mexico City just before the Conquest. Unit three presents primary source materials which illustrate the treatment of a woman genius (Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz) in 17th century Mexico. Translations from the original Nahuatl or Spanish  contain oral histories, surveys of public opinion, notary records, wills, letters, and autobiographies. Each unit begins with an introduction to the text and ends with an information section which provides comparisons, additional facts, or strategies, and questions for reflection and discussion. To evaluate the academic work, a take-home essay is suggested. (Author/NE)",

        "description":"The purpose of this project was to conduct a complete survey of the various states to determine the existence and content of state mandates and competency statements as they relate to economic literacy. The data collection procedure involved surveying the 50 state departments of education to determine the existence of mandates and/or competency statements for economic literacy. The survey was based on the following definition of mandate: any legislative or state board of education ruling requiring the teaching of economics in the curriculum. Mandates were classified as emphasizing either economic education, consumer education, or the free enterprise system. Data collection spanned the period November 1980 to June 1981. Results are presented primarily in table form, including (1)  a state-by-state summary of the status of mandates, competencies, and pertinent comments; and (2) a frequency list of economic concepts found in 13 selected state frameworks, competency statements, and courses of study. A 16-point summary of findings reveals that 24 states have a mandate requiring economic instruction of some kind; mandates tend to result from cooperative efforts of the business community, state boards of education, and state legislatures; and mandates are most common in southern states and least prevalent in the northeast and midwest.

A purpose of the colloquium was to gather and disseminate this information for the Historians/Artifacts/Learners (HAL) project. Included is a lead article; six papers presented at the colloquium; an analysis of the proceedings; remarks, discussion, and recommendations made at the colloquium; and a selected list of course syllabi, books, and articles. The lead article describes five individuals who recognized the importance of using artifacts in the teaching of history. The six papers discuss using artifacts to teach history in the disciplines of cultural  anthropology and folklore studies, social history, art history, cultural geography, history of technology, and historical archaeology. The remarks and discussion article summarizes and interprets the papers presented at the colloquium. Among the recommendations of the HAL staff are that a single resource, most likely a publication, be compiled and that curriculum materials be developed for using artifacts in teaching history.

The first section of the paper discusses the opposition of Christian fundamentalists to evolution, going back to Charles Darwin's 1859 \"Origin of Species.\" Covered also are science curriculum revisions following Sputnik, up to the 1981 adoption of equal time laws in Arkansas and Louisiana. In this section the January 5, 1982, ruling of Federal District Judge William R. Overton, declaring Arkansas's 1981 equal time Evolution/Creation teach law unconstitutional, is analyzed. The second section of the paper summarizes anti-creationist arguments by scientists and others. One argument is that creationists use subterfuge to supplant evolution with state-enforced Biblical  teaching. The paper concludes with suggestions to educators on how to counter the arguments and actions of creationists. Arguing that the creationist effort is really a political rather than a scientific issue, the author suggests that educators need to resist lawmakers' efforts to dictate curriculum, to have ready access to the legal directives guiding state and local school unit teaching about religious or other controversial subjects, and to organize an active procedures committee for the purpose of dealing with political pressures on the curriculum. A list of professional organizations that have spoken out on the evolution/creation controversy is included. (NE)",

The materials were selected by three panels of evaluators using three areas of criteria: (1) appropriateness for use in learning situations; (2) ethnic authenticity of content, and (3) technical quality for potential dissemination. An introduction describes the purpose of the evaluation project, development of evaluation instruments, selection of panelists who evaluated materials, and process and results of the evaluation. One hundred and two projects (comprised of 438 pieces of materials) are evaluated. These evaluations are organized by state or territory and, within each state or territory, by the institution that received the grant.  Headings for each entry include information on the project title and address, name of project director, ethnic group or groups on which the project focused, audience and grade level for the project, the project's subject (curricular) area, the format of the materials developed (i.e., print or nonprint), the amount of funding, the titles of materials accepted, and availability information for each piece of material. The heading information is followed by a description of the project materials. The final and major portion of the entry for each project presents evaluative comments and suggestions made by members of the three panels. Four indexes facilitate use of the analyses--ethnic group, geographic area, subject area, and materials titles. Appendices include evaluation instruments and a  list of Ethnic Studies projects.

Objectives of the evaluation were: (1) to determine how much the character-building materials were used and how the teachers valued the materials; (2) to determine attitudes of students toward the use and effectiveness of the materials; (3) to obtain teachers' suggestions relating to any future use of the materials; and (4) to assess cognitive differences on tests between students in the Character Education Program and a comparable group who were not in it. In the evaluation, eight schools were chosen from the 52 using the materials. Within each school, teachers in the third and fifth grades were given a questionnaire designed to address  the objectives of the study relating to their perceptions of the effectiveness of the program. Students in the program and the comparable group completed questionnaires and two tests--The Character Education Test and the Stanford Achievement Test. Findings showed that teachers and students appear to be most favorably disposed toward the program, teachers use the materials on a regular basis, and most teachers do not believe that the materials have been responsible for behavioral changes in their students. There was no measurable differences in character building between those students in the program and those not in it. The authors concluded that the program should be continued, but not expanded until its actual effects can be determined. Tests and questionnaires are appended.  (NE)",

        "description":"This paper examines education in China from 1949 to 1979. Education plays a key role in Chinese society. The main goal of Chinese educational policy is to produce workers with both socialist consciousness and culture. The Chinese conception of education is very broad and includes the regular school system, work-study education, and informal mass education. The paper quotes significant points from the &quot;Common Program,&quot; the first tentative constitution adopted in 1949. The educational achievements in China between 1949 and 1966 are then reviewed and assessed. In 1949 China declared war on illiteracy. Efforts were undertaken to make the Chinese written language easier to learn. Romanization was used as a tool to aid pronunciation of the Chinese characters. The written Chinese  characters were also simplified by reducing the number of strokes. Nurseries, kindergartens, and primary and secondary school education were expanded. Vocational and specialized schools were opened. In 1949 there were 207 higher educational institutions. By the mid 1960s there were 400. On May 7, 1966, Mao issued the famous &quot;Directive on Education&quot; which has served as the basis for all subsequent revolutionary activities in education. The reforms and innovations which occurred between 1966 and 1976 are described. For example, the down-to-the-countryside program was launched in 1968 and continues to be one of the key policies of China. The dilemmas encountered during the Cultural Revolution decade are also examined. The paper concludes with a description of the contemporary revised  educational approach, 1977-1979, and the national emphasis on the &quot;Four Modernizations.&quot; (RM)",

        "description":"This paper examines multicultural education--its history, goals, for whom it is designed, and who is responsible for initiating programs. The literature is in general accord with the view that the educational system should be responsive to the fact that the United States is culturally diverse. This fact is taken as the ground for asserting that diversity should be both reflected in school curricula and valued by those who work in education, especially teachers and administrators. In most of the literature, multicultural education is presented as a humanistic as well as a relativistic concept. It is a means of celebrating diversity, striving for human rights and social justice, and legitimizing the alternative life choices and various styles of all people. In 1972 the Ethnic  Heritage Studies Act was passed by Congress, emphasizing the heterogeneity of America's population. In the same year the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education adopted a statement on multicultural education which upheld the value of cultural pluralism as the ultimate goal of multicultural education. Multicultural education rests on the fact of cultural diversity and the ideology of cultural pluralism. It is necessary to have a policy of multicultural education. Programs must be designed for all members of society. Placing the burden for implementing multicultural education programs on institutions of higher learning will not achieve more than moderate success without broad-based civic and societal support.

        "description":"This paper presents phenomenology as an alternative approach in conducting educational research. The aim of phenomenological research is the exploration of the fundamental consciousness of the person or people being studied so that their perceptions can be identified and interpreted. Today's phenomenology comes from the work of a group of European philosophers. The fathers of the movement are two Germans, Franz Brentano and Edmund Husserl. Other contributors to phenomenology are also discussed in the paper. Phenomenology is then contrasted with normative conceptual, analytic, and empirical research methodologies. The conventional methodology of interpreting the thought of some educational theorist or pedagogical movement by analyzing, categorizing, comparing, and contrasting  concepts is based on a paradigmatic framework. According to this model, human beings react and respond to the world outside of themselves on the basis of identifiable shared mental structures. Phenomenological paradigms are based on a different rationale and function differently than do normative ones. Phenomenologists assert that every human being has a unique life of consciousness. The paper then describes the processes involved in doing phenomenological investigations. Two requirements are rigorous detachment on the part of the researcher and a focus on the pure consciousness of the informant not on observable behavior or recognizable conceptual modes. Methods for focusing on this pure consciousness are described. The article concludes with brief descriptions of four recent studies in  which phenomenological methodology was used. (RM)",

        "description":"The ten essays that comprise this anthology concerning the people of Connecticut were written by high school students in Connecticut for the First Ethnic Studies Competition held in 1979-1980. The aim of the competition was to increase awareness of cultural pluralism in the state, to encourage multicultural education, to improve intergroup understanding among citizens, and to expand the available multicultural resources about similarities and differences in Connecticut ethnicity. Twenty five manuscripts were entered in the competition in three categories: oral histories, local histories, and photographic studies. These entries were judged on the basis of six criteria: general appearance, the accuracy of their contents, the insights that they provide into life experiences, their  format and development, the depth of cross-cultural understanding that was demonstrated, and the choice of the sources employed. Winning essays included in the anthology are: &quot;Natividade Cunha -- A Luso-American in New Haven, Connecticut;&quot;&quot;A Struggle for Identity -- A Case Study of Ukrainians;&quot;&quot;A Journey to a New Life;&quot;&quot;Bob Mikulka of Branford, Connecticut;&quot;&quot;Polonia in New Britain;&quot;&quot;Mae Yimoyines of Hartford, Connecticut;&quot;&quot;Jennie Mary Manzi -- Immigrant from Italy;&quot;&quot;Katharina Wendler Beauvais -- The Life Story of a Hungarian-American;&quot;&quot;Fred Olsen -- Roots from Norway and England in Guilford, Connecticut;&quot; and &quot;The Italian-Americans of Waterbury, Connecticut.&quot; (RM)",

        "description":"This paper examines oral history as one of the main types of evidence available to people who are investigating educational concerns from an historical perspective. The first part of the paper describes existing oral history collections many of which deal with subjects related to education. For example, a history professor at Columbia University arranged for the first formal taped oral history interviews in 1948. His efforts brought into being the huge oral history collection housed in Butler Library at Columbia. Included in this special collection are tapes concerning the founding of the American Association of Physics Teachers, the first fifty-eight years of the Carnegie Corporation as a philanthropic organization, and China educational missionaries, 1900-1950. The second part  of the paper provides and discusses various definitions of oral history and examines why people undertake oral histories. The final section of the paper examines the oral history process. It discusses the eight main steps involved in doing oral history: surveying and contacting, explaining, planning, preparing interview outlines, establishing rapport, taking notes, closing the interview, and following post-interview procedures. The appendices contain questions used by the staff of the \"Peoples of Connecticut Project\" in their interviews with persons of different ethnic origins and the permission form that interviewees were asked to sign.

The educators hope that reports of their China visit will help Americans better understand what is happening in China and that this understanding will give studies of China a place in America's school curriculum which is commensurate with its importance. The report begins with a discussion of several conclusions of interest to American educators and U.S. China scholars. For example, the Chinese recognize that education, especially in science and technology, is essential if they are to reach the development goals they have set for themselves between now and the end of the century. Education in China remains focused to a remarkable degree on the development of collective political  consciousness. The &quot;back to basics&quot; movement has not occurred to the extent reported abroad. The Chinese are largely succeeding in their second most important educational goal: to develop a work force capable of meeting their national production needs. The report goes on to discuss other topics, such as educational decision making; educational organization, politics, and curriculum; labor in the countryside; admissions examinations and quotas; China's educational goals compared to the United States; and the use of group norms, models, and symbols.

        "author":["French, Rod"],
        "description":"This publication contains the proceedings of a Wingspread conference held in Racine, Wisconsin in March 1977, dealing with the topic of criminal sentencing alternatives. The conference grew out of a controversy within the Wisconsin Council on Criminal Justice over &quot;determinant&quot; versus &quot;indeterminant&quot; sentencing. Under a determinant sentencing system, the offender serves a specific legislatively prescribed sentence for a specific crime. Judges have only limited discretion to vary the sentence. The parole board function of evaluating prisoners for release is abolished. With indeterminant sentencing, the system used in Wisconsin and 46 of the 50 states, judges have broad discretionary powers when sentencing. Although many judges do use general, personal guidelines for determining  sentences, those guidelines can and do vary widely from judge to judge and from region to region. Under this system, after a person is sentenced, the parole board has wide latitude in determining whether an offender will be released early or made to serve his full sentence. There are five sections to the report. The problems with indeterminant sentencing are discussed in section one. In the second section, an inmate, a legislator, and an attorney talk about their feelings concerning the indeterminant sentencing system. What the determinant sentencing system would do to curb these problems is then examined. Problems with the determinant sentencing system are dealt with in the third section. Other alternatives to the problem are discussed in section four. The final section describes  concerns of the discussion groups participating in the conference. (RM)",

The interaction of these two factors and their relationship to exhibition and sales success were also studied. Two techniques were used to collect data. The first was a series of group discussions with professional artists in Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Houston, and Minneapolis/St. Paul. The second was a mail survey of the same population, which resulted in 940 completed interviews. There are seven chapters to the report: Historical Perspectives and the Artists' Perspectives on Issues and Problems; Conceptual Framework and Methodology; Socio-demographic and Art Form, Characteristics of the Sample; Economic and Work Conditions;  Occupational Conditions I, Exposure; Occupational Conditions II, the Exhibition Process; and Assessment of Needs. Examples of some of the findings follow. A large proportion of artists in the sample had low incomes. Women and younger and older artists had relatively low incomes. Washington, D.C. artists had by far the lowest personal earnings, but also the lowest work-related expenses. Thirty-nine percent of the artists held an art-related part-time job so that they could survive economically. Expenses for studio space were a major concern. The most successful artists are characterized by high quality shows, high income, an orientation to commercial galleries, self-reliance, and exhibitor connections. (RM)",

This rests upon the certainty of change and the need to  redress deficiencies. Recommendations on global education are cited from statements by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education and the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education.

Two four-week units were taught, the first on movement education and fundamental movement skills, and the second on gymnastics. Two treatment groups were randomly selected, and classes were conducted by six experienced teachers who had been trained in the two teaching styles. In the teacher decision-making group, all decisions relevant to planning, execution, and evaluation of students' performance were made by teacher. In the shared decision group, the students could choose the task to be performed and its level and duration, and could use instructional wall charts or solicit the teacher's assistance. A control group received no physical education. Analyses were  made of student attitudes, creativity, motor skills, and self concept. Based on the findings, it is concluded that: (1) Grade level determined the effects of sharing decisions; (2) Any physical education program, regardless of decision making dominance, was better than no program; and (3) Encouraging children to participate in meaningful decision making will increase positive attitudes toward human movement, enhance creative thinking and self concept, and improve motor skills.

Seven research questions determined: (1) how CTs used the TLC to support their work; (2) to what extent the CTs' patterns of use of the TLC was affected by or affected the  patterns of use by the teachers they served; (3) how much knowledge CTs had regarding resources and programs available from the TLC; (4) how CTs' perceptions of support systems available to them affected their patterns of use of the TLC; (5) how CTs' perceptions of their own roles in the local school affected the ways in which they used TLC resources; (6) how CTs' use of the TLC affected their assessments of the center; and (7) how the data collected by the previous questions may be used to enable the TLC to provide more effective support for CTs. Responses to these questions are presented in tabular form accompanied by narrative discussions. The implications of the study's findings for teacher centers and school advisors are discussed. (JD)",

        "description":"Board functions, participation, activities, and program outcomes of the Detroit Center for Professional Growth and Development were studied to determine the effects of a change in board membership on the functioning of the center. From 1975 to September 1979, the center's governing board had been composed of key officials, several whom were teachers, of five educational organizations. In October 1979, membership was expanded to include six more teachers in response to federal and state teacher center legislation requiring a teacher majority on such boards. Trend analyses were conducted over a five-year period through examination of documents from board meetings and objective measures of program planning and outcomes for three center components: (1) Field Consultant Service; (2)  the Mathematics Education Resource Center; and (3) the Reading Resource Center. Characteristics of the five-member governing board during the first four years differed from those of the 11-member policy board in the fifth year. Fewer board meetings were held, and agendas were less complex in the fifth year. Financial issues remained a major concern for board consideration, although obtaining release time for teachers became a recurring issue in the fifth year. For all five years, teachers were the major participants in motion formulation, and there was very little controversy among board members on the issues. Program decisions continued to be made by the staff of the center, as the board remained primarily concerned with funding aspects of the center's activities. (FG)",

The Diagnostic Teaching Cycle (DTC), which is being used to evaluate the undergraduate program of the Division of Elementary Education, has five components: identify, hypothesize, formulate goals and objectives, instruct and remediate, and provide formative and summative evaluation. Use of DTC determined program strengths and weaknesses for students, division faculty, department faculty, resources, and public school cooperation. In addition to the DTC evaluation, the university has a contract with the Georgia State Department of Education to develop performance-based teacher assessment instruments for beginning teachers. These instruments, called Teacher  Performance Assessment Instruments, measure: (1) teaching plans and materials; (2) classroom procedures; (3) interpersonal skills; (4) professional standards; and (5) student perceptions. The first three tests are required for certification renewal, and all are administered at 17 regional assessment centers. A computer-based application of the Teacher Performance Assessment Instruments is being planned to provide preservice teachers with diagnostic profiles of strengths and weaknesses in academic content, pedagogy, and curriculum. This formative evaluation will also be used to refine and improve the undergraduate program. (FG)",

The evaluation focused on determining participants' perceptions of the effects of SSIA on their teaching practices and on the teachers' role as change agent in their schools. Teachers responded to questionnaires on the last day of the program and to a similar follow-up questionnaire six months later. Interviews and classroom observations were also conducted with the ten randomly selected participants. The majority of responses indicated that there was a successful transfer of training  from the SSIA program to the classroom.

Subjects were 33 male and 10 female members of volleyball, basketball, track and field, and cross country university athletic teams. Athletes answered Form B of the Sports Attitudes Inventory, a sport-specific instrument designed to measure three competition related motives. Subjects then rated themselves on competitiveness, and coaches' ratings of athletes' competitiveness were obtained. Results of a step wise regression analysis revealed that coaches' ratings of the athletes' skills were the most important predictors of the coaches' competitiveness ratings. Self-peer ratings of competitiveness  and power motive scores were also important predictive variables. Results confirmed earlier findings with female high schol athletes with respect to the relationship between coaches' perceptions of competitiveness and skill. Power was found to be the best of the three motives in predicting coaches' ratings of competitiveness, and fear was found to be the next most frequent motive. (Authors/FG)",

        "description":"Three types of homework assignments are commmon in schools in the United States: practice, preparation, and extension. To be effective, practice exercises must be highly individualized and based on the progress of each student. Preparation normally refers to reading assignments given prior to class meetings. Homework of this sort should be carefully assigned to ensure that the student receives a clear idea of the assignment's purpose. Extension homework attempts to take the student beyond the work done in class. Research into the effectiveness of homework in improving academic achievement is inconclusive. The role of homework as a link between home and school is vital, and assignments can serve as a means of providing a bond of common effort between parent, child, and teacher.  Inappropriate or badly explained assignments, however, can just as readily serve as a source of antagonism between parent, teacher, and child. The emergence of cable television, home computers, videotape and videodiscs, and information utilities is changing the role and format of home study, and, for the teacher interested in the question of homework, the primary significance of these trends lies not in their suggestions for present homework practices but rather their implications for future practices. A list is provided in this pamphlet of basic guidelines and principles that can help the classroom teacher arrive at a feasible homework policy. (JD)",

Six hundred fifty-three participants were compared to 264 control subjects for pre- to post-program changes across the four psychophysiological stress response variables of frontalis EMG, pulse rate, pulse amplitude, and skin potential response as well as three psychometric variables including Type A/B behavior, locus of control, and manifest anxiety. Post-test analysis revealed that program participants displayed significantly lower measured stress activity for frontalis muscle tension, pulse amplitude, and skin potential response  compared to control subjects. Psychometric changes included significantly reduced manifest anxiety and a significant locus of control shift to internality in program participants compared to controls. The results indicate that, in relation to several measures of biological integrity and mental well-being, the program under investigation was producing a significant, beneficial impact on human health via the precursors to psychosomatic disease.

Thirty-four beginning teachers were interviewed at the end of their first year of teaching and again at the end of their third or fourth year. They were asked to recall learning activities they had participated in, to describe attributes of those activities, and to make judgments about each experience. It was found that 18 categories of learning experiences could be identified (workshops, night classes, clinics, seminars, summer school, etc.), and that participation was extensive. While night classes and summer school accounted for the largest  portion of hours of learning experiences, other types of experiences were sought. The types of learning experiences that received the most favorable responses were those that were highly individualized or very practical; such as solving particular problems and developing classroom materials in clinics and workshops. There was favorable response to experiences when beginners themselves were asked to make presentations or perform in a leadership capacity. A rather surprising finding was that the teachers from this sample appeared to feel that, the further away from their own school site the learning experience was held, the more satisfied they felt with it and the more applicable they saw it to their teaching. College personnel and administrators or curriculum specialists were found to be  the least preferred trainers, and teachers and consultants were the most preferred. Learning experiences undertaken for personal satisfaction or personal growth were highly rated. The teachers most actively involved in outside learning experiences were rated as most competent by their superiors. (JD)",

The literature search and data collection revealed several nutrition-related health and dietary problems of children in Hawaii. Nutrition education was found to be lacking especially at the senior high school level, the grade level at which students also had the poorest diets. Parents felt that nutrition education was important in both the home and school, although some indicated they did not always set a good example  for their children. Preschool and lower elementary teachers were more involved in nutrition education than were other teachers; however, many did not take nutrition-related coursework as part of their training. Teachers at all levels generally felt that students were interested in nutrition, parents were not resistant, and cost was not a limiting factor in conducting nutrition education. Administrators teachers, and food service managers agreed that coordination of classroom nutrition activities with the food service program is needed but rarely carried out. It is recommended that training for teachers must provide not only nutrition information but also teaching strategies and support services for improving students' eating habits. It is also recommended that food managers receive  training in managerial skills and that training in nutrition should be provided for school nurses and health aides. (JD)",

The Data-Based Staff Development Program was designed to assist school personnel responsible for implementing the ALEM in systematically incorporating relevant data on the degree of program implementation and students' learning progress in analyses of their staff development needs. The goal is to provide a self-monitoring tool that helps school personnel become increasingly more independent in establishing and maintaining a high degree of ALEM implementation. During the 1980-81 school year, a pilot investigation of the  effectiveness of this program in improving classroom implementation of the ALEM was conducted in ten elementary schools. Data were obtained through the use of three measures: (1) instruments measuring degree of program implementation; (2) school district staff development plans; and (3) monthly training logs kept by the schools' education specialists. The data were analyzed to investigate the relationship between staff development plans and program implementation needs as suggested in the degree of implementation scores for individual teachers. Preliminary evidence from the study supports the effectiveness of the program; more detailed studies in the future will be needed to confirm this finding.

        "description":"The extent to which 148 teachers felt that their training programs prepared them to teach students with special needs was examined. A questionnaire was developed to ascertain whether teachers were able to carry out reponsibilities mandated through the passing of Public Law 94-142. Respondents were asked to rate their overall preparation and training in five areas: methods, materials, child and adolescent development and psychology, reading, and mainstreaming. The teachers also rated their preparation for recognizing and handling students having problems with drugs, abuse, learning disabilities, and emotional disturbances. Teachers were asked to suggest major changes that should be made in teacher training programs. Analyses of results were conducted and grouped according to: (1)  years of teaching experience; (2) location of training--in Minnesota or elsewhere; and (3) training at public or private institutions. Although most teachers gave good or fair ratings overall to their training programs, poor ratings appeared with great frequency in the areas of reading, mainstreaming, and recognizing students with specific problems. Ratings by teachers with less than five years of experience indicated they were more satisfied with their training than were teachers with 10 or more years of experience. Appendices provide analysis and discussion of the survey's findings and a copy of the questionnaire. (FG)",

        "description":"As the procedures of evaluation research have developed during recent years, it has become clear that the results of evaluation studies have failed to provide policy decision makers with useful information. An approach towards designing and implementing more useful evaluations--the stakeholder survey--is discussed. Stakeholders are individuals, or groups, who have a direct interest in the program being evaluated. The central premise of this paper is that the information needs of stakeholders should be incorporated directly into the formulation of evaluation objectives, and the design of the evaluation to achieve those objectives. A rationale for the stakeholder survey is presented, and its three primary functions (identification, contact and information synthesis) are described,  as are application of the approach in a multi-year evaluation of a national supplemental food program. Also considered are key issues involved in applying the approach. The evidence from this study suggests that such surveys are not only feasible, but also of considerable value to the evaluation team.

Therefore, most retain financial independence from programs evaluated. The best placement of R and E offices in the school district's organizational chart appeared to be in a direct line relationship to the superintendent. Evaluators should be independent and their office should not be in the same branch as curriculum and instruction. The staff of most R and E offices is small and composed of members having various educational backgrounds and degrees. Two thirds have a relatively high ratio of support to resource staff. Many units also have access to computer  facilities. R and E activities center around testing and outcome evaluation. Maintenance of information files and preparation of statistical reports were also significant activities of the staff. The most common data collection technique employed seemed to be tests and questionnaires, supplemented by other collection methods. R and E staff are sole determiners of report content or have ultimate authority over report contents. Several suggestions are offered for increasing evaluation use. (DWH)",

The institutionalization of educational research in this area has evolved over the past thirty years. The settings for research institutions have been the university, government ministry of education, and private enterprise. The research findings have been used for legitimization of policy changes; justification of educational expenditures; ensuring quality; and action as a problem solving device. Most of the research has conformed to the traditional mode of thought and has been imitative, rather than inventive. A meeting of researchers in the Caribbean was held in Barbados in 1981. As a result, the group decided on the necessity for linkages to be established between researchers across several  disciplines. Biennial conferences of educational researchers rotating among countries was suggested. An agency was needed to oversee the institutionalization of educational research in the region. A proposal was made for universities of the region to discuss regional loans for research with governments. Establishment of a Caribbean Educational Review and Advisory Group was proposed as the most effective means of drawing together educational researchers to give direction, guidance, and inspiration to the development of educational research in the region.

The functional level of the test was taken by all students. The second level of testing was randomly assigned at the adjacent higher or lower level of the test. Functional level testing is the method of using students' instructional level rather than age or grade level to assign achievement test levels. Test reliability and stability of scores from one test level to another were studied. Content validity was also a major factor in determining which test was suitable for use. Testing appeared to be more reliable in high achievement schools than in low achievement schools. Three of the five tests evaluated were  determined to be suitable for Chicago elementary schools. Two of the tests were found to be less suitable because it was difficult to determine an accurate means of student placement. (DWH)",

Residuals of observed minus expected test scores revealed statistically significant differences between students who took a single administration of the SAT as juniors and those who took the same initial administration but also repeated the test as seniors. The initial observed scores of students later repeating the test were consistently lower than their expected scores for both the verbal and mathematical sections. The results indicate that  self-selection occurs when students decide to repeat a test. Score changes among these students reflect negative errors of measurement on the initial test administration.

        "description":"Evidence from a variety of sources suggests that systematic differences can be found in the ratings given to student essays as a function not only of the student's skills but also of aspects of both the student's background and the background of the rater. Additionally, the nature of the prompt which provided the central theme of the essay might bias the outcome of the ratings of that essay. A study of ratings of fifth and sixth graders who wrote paragraph-long essays in response to two topics presented either in written or pictorial form is presented. Students were classified as Hispanic-surnamed or non-Hispanic-surnamed; two teachers, trained as raters using an objectively-based essay scoring scheme, represented an Hispanic cultural background and two a non-Hispanic background.  Results from a blind rating of 100 complete essays show that several of the rating subscales were significantly influenced by an interaction between student ethnicity and rater ethnicity, and several subscales by rater ethnicity alone. Student ethnicity alone was not a significant main effect on any subscale. Prompt modality is significant for one subscale, and interacts with rater ethnicity on one other. The findings are interpreted as a direct indication of biased assessment. (Author)",

        "description":"Three alternative methods for placing post-secondary students into freshman English or remedial writing classes are compared. The study contrasted: (1) a proposed system-wide test combining multiple choice and essay scores; (2) the holistic essay scoring procedures used at separate university campuses; and (3) an analytic scoring rubric developed at a university-based research center. The comparability of scores obtained from the three methods and the placement decisions they implied are examined. High school seniors from two university campuses took an experimental version of the proposed system-wide placement examination. Relationships were low among scores from the different testing methods, and substantially different proportions of students were classified as masters or  non-masters. These findings were interpreted as evidence that \"good\" writing does not consistently emerge, regardless of the test used and that systematic selection of placement measures requires detailed scrutiny of the reliability and validity of placement standards, scoring criteria and their emphasis on essay features.

Also examined was the relationship between FDI performance and performance on the verbal and analytical subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Revised (WISC-R). The effect of a test warm-up, or tuning procedure on FDI measures was assessed. Main findings of the study were: (1) no ethnicity by tuning interactions occurred, indicating that treatment effects did not differ between Chicanos and Anglos; (2) tuned Anglos scored higher than tuned Chicanos on Block Design and  CEFT but the groups did not differ on PRFT or HFDT; (3) control Chicanos and Anglos did not differ on CEFT, PRFT or HFDT but did differ on Block Design; (4) Aptitude/tuning interactions emerged; and (5) Correlations between PRFT, CEFT, and HFDT averaged around .25 among controls and around .40 among tuned subjects--correlations with Block Design averaged .45. Research results identifying Chicanos as field dependent were not supported by this study. Tuning data suggest pretest procedures for adequate measurement of Chicano children's abilities.

        "description":"Item banks offer a different approach to test development than that of the more traditional item specification method. This study was designed as an initial comparative investigation in the Area. Fourth grade math and reading tests were developed using both items written from item specifications and items drawn from an existing item bank. Four separate panels were formed to construct the tests and their development activities were documented for time and cost comparisons. Psychometric properties of the four tests were also compared although no consistent results between the two general methods were found. Finally, overall quality and content coverage of the tests were judged by classroom teachers. The report is divided into five major sections. The introduction includes a  statement of the problem under investigation in the study, a review of related literature, and a statement of the current status of item banking in education. The second section, Design of the Study, describes the plans for the study. The third section, Conduct of the Study, explains how the study actually was conducted, showing when and how the actual implementation differed from the planned implementation. The fourth section presents Results of the Study. The last section discusses what has been learned from the research and talks about Implications for Future Test Development Efforts, which include (1) necessity of reading level indicator from reading passages; (2) the number of items available in a reading passage; and (3) information concerning the difficulty of items within the  bank.

The project comprises classroom and home based programs located in four kindergarten sites in predominatly Hispanic communities. Classroom programs aim to develop communication and awareness skills by developing social and physical knowledge, representational skills,  cognitive/logic/mathematics skills, self and cultural identity, and role playing skills. Home based programs are designed to deliver instructional support systems to children and their parents. Project P.I.A.G.E.T. uses current research results in program development, implementation, and evaluation.

The report concludes that desegregation, if effectively implemented, provides benefits not only to classrooms and schools but also to communities. It is emphasized that while desegregation has increased demands on schools and communities, the benefits outweigh the costs.

An extended Model-C analysis was performed for the first group and an Extended Model-A analysis was performed for the second group. Results show sustaining effects in grade 6 for both reading and math, in grade 5 for math only, and in grade 4 for neither component. The Instructional Strategy Study aimed at determining which instructional strategy (regular classroom, pull-out, or  lab) has been most effective with Title I pupils. Twelve classes from grades two to seven were considered at four different schools. The impact of student overall academic standing and general program status was controlled. Results of the analysis of variance performed showed that the pull-out method tends to be the most effective, although where Title I enrollment was small, the lab approach was preferable.

The module consists of three units, each of which contains 1) a content outline; 2) suggested steps for teaching the content; 3) opening exercises to introduce concepts and ideas; 4) resource information from which the trainer can develop lectures; 5) group activities to reinforce concepts introduced in the lecture; and 6) exercises to help individual trainees gain a more in-depth understanding of key concepts. The units allow  teachers to identify examples of teacher expectations; examine how expectations influence educational progress; identify sources of expectations; distinguish between realistic and biased expectations; and sharpen skills in communicating clear, realistic expectations to students. An annotated bibliography includes selected resources on race and sex bias in instructional materials, career guidance for minority girls, and background information on minority women. (Author/MJL)",

        "description":"This report explores the issue of affirmative action within the context of a problem-remedy approach, where affirmative action is regarded as a response to the problem of race, ethnic, and sex discrimination. Part A investigates discriminatory attitudes and behavior as practiced consciously or unconsciously by individuals, organizations, or whole social structures. Part B examines how civil rights law acknowledges the existence of various forms of discrimination against women and minorities; discusses how these laws provide remedies to counteract discrimination through affirmative action plans that use race, sex, and national origin as criteria in decision making; and explains how voluntary affirmative action can be taken without incurring legal liability. Part C distinguishes  between the proper use and the abuse of affirmative action plans and measures that take race, sex, and national origin into account in determining quotas. The report emphasizes that particular measures used in affirmative action plans are responses to the nature and extent of discrimination that is demonstrated to exist in a particular situation, rather than isolated practices intended to benefit certain groups. The appendix presents guidelines for implementing effective affirmative action plans in employment using the problem-remedy approach. (Author/MJL)",

The manual advocates a comprehensive approach that would direct affirmative action at students, curricular and extracurricular programs, all phases of employment, and public policy affecting housing. One section of the manual discusses the Constitutional and statutory basis of equal education and equal employment opportunity. Two succeeding sections describe the evolution of court litigation concerning discrimination in education and in employment. Another section provides suggestions for planning and implementing an equal education/equal employment opportunity program in racially segregated suburban  schools by identifying factors essential to successful desegregation programs and describing how to develop an affirmative action policy and program. A final section discusses how, in a comprehensive approach, education, employment, and housing are linked; distinguishes between integration and desegregation; and demonstrates how equal opportunity reflects American ideals.

        "description":"The unjustified assumption that black children have limited verbal or articulation skills stems from the fact that blacks use figurative, nonliteral, and nonstandard language in the classroom. The language that most disadvantaged blacks learn at home and bring to the classroom is a restricted form born out of poverty and limited exposure to good language models. This kind of figurative language is reflected in black folk songs, spirituals, and poetry which express emotions, experiences, consciousness of the world, and religious fervor. The language in these literary forms is often mispronounced, misspelled, and ungrammatical, and must be translated to become meaningful to those who are used to standard English. Disadvantaged black children are often judged to be underdeveloped  with respect to language. In fact, they have a fully developed language system which is different from standard, middle class English. Teachers' failure to recognize black language patterns as different rather than deficient leads to negative teacher attitudes, students' reading difficulties, and school failure. To improve disadvantaged black students' reading skills, it is important to adjust materials to suit the learner and hire competent reading teachers. (MJL)",

The discussion counters the charge that this policy is inconsistent with the law as enunciated by the Supreme Court and as demonstrated in three cases often cited: 1) &quot;Bakke,&quot; a reverse discrimination case in which the court supported a school's interest in a diverse student body but upheld a student's individual right to be free from racial discrimination; 2) &quot;Fullilove,&quot; where minority set aside provisions in public works employment were supported; and 3) &quot;Weber,&quot; in which a race conscious quota  scheme for employee training was upheld. It is contended that these legal precedents do not represent Supreme Court endorsements of quotas, but merely demonstrate that the limited use of racial criteria is not forbidden. It is emphasized that the Department's approach to race and sex discrimination in employment provides relief for identifiable victims of discrimination but removes considerations of color and gender in future hiring and promotion practices.

Teacher ratings indicated increases in students' positive attitudes toward their own culture and toward other cultures. Staff responses to questionnaires on the quality of inservice training and parent perceptions of classes in English as a Second Language for parents were  generally favorable. In addition, parents expressed satisfaction with the bilingual education program for their children.

        "description":"This report presents the findings of research and public hearings on the development of racial isolation in Miami, Florida. Maintaining that Miami's black community is isolated from the city as a whole, and that the sense of black isolation and frustration precipitated the civil disturbances in Miami in May of 1980, the report examines the causes of black alienation and the role of public and private leadership in correcting the situation. Identified as a major influence in the development of racial alienation is the urban renewal program which pushed large numbers of blacks out of their traditional neighborhoods and into isolated and severely deteriorated areas. Other manifestations of black isolation include high unemployment and a lack of access to job training and  advancement, adequate housing, the justice system, and equal educational opportunities among the city's black and minority population. It is concluded that solving Miami's problems requires a coordinated effort of public and private sectors to eliminate the underlying causes of racial isolation. Such efforts, it is maintained, should be directed toward dropout prevention; maximum school desegregation; efficient vocational and bilingual instruction; improved housing conditions; affirmative action in employment; and provision of greater access to the juvenile justice system and related services.

Input came from educators, scholars, federal officials, and persons from labor and management. Conference participants stated that more persons are in apprenticeships (395,000) in the United States than ever before, but there was no agreement about whether this supply of apprentices is large enough and is in the right occupational areas to prevent a skilled labor shortage in the future. Conference presenters stated that gains had been made in providing equal opportunity for minorities, especially blacks, during the past few years, through outreach programs and other nontraditional methods of recruitment. Gains have also been made by females, although the  percentage of female apprentices remains low. The same is true for Hispanics, who are becoming increasingly vocal about their need for more apprenticeship opportunities. Other issues discussed by conference participants included the following: (1) whether equity for minority groups is compatible with economic efficiency; (2) whether age requirements for apprentices should be lowered to encourage more youth to participate or raised to permit women to enter later in life; (3) the propriety of financial incentives to encourage industry to expand apprenticeships; (4) the quality of apprenticeship training; and (5) linkages of apprenticeships with other training systems.

        "description":"Economic policy today is often stated in the terms of &quot;demand managers&quot; and &quot;simple supply-siders&quot; who look upon economic policy simply as a matter of stimulus or restraint. It matters little what programs are cut as long as overall spending is reduced to cool inflation. On the other hand, the real supply-side economists recognize the necessity for an education, training, and social services structure to develop human capital into a productive work force. Current antinflationary policies are especially destructive of human capital development, the real force that will lead to increased prosperity. A plan of moderate, rather than indiscriminate, budget cutting would be more sensible; this plan should scrutinize every expenditure, sparing certain ones, such as for vocational  education, that have a potential for encouraging productivity and price stability. As we move toward this type of real supply-side policies, programs that emphasize the development of human capital should become more important. Also, if supply-side policies are to succeed, they must be more decentralized in their application. The real supply-side economics would encourage an increased capacity for bottom-up, subnational economic development. Vocational education should continue to play a major role in this process of development. (KC)",

While the major focus of the study was on changes in the public service employment (PSE) programs, other areas were examined, including aspects of CETA management, service delivery systems, the role of organized labor, and job placement. The study was based largely on field reviews of a sample of 28 prime sponsors and was conducted about 18 months after the CETA amendments became fully effective. Included among the major study findings were the following: (1) the CETA changes made managers substantially more sensitive to the need of protecting the programs' integrity; (2) while new monitoring and liability requirements led some sponsors to centralize intake under their own direct  control, other amendment requirements tended to fragment overall delivery systems; (3) while CETA changes achieved a sharp shift to targeting a more disadvantaged clientele, lowered wage rates reduced the usefulness of PSE services to the community; (4) organized labor played a significant role in about 20 percent of the areas studied; and (5) while CETA reauthorization enhanced the employability of participants, they also resulted in the enrollment of individuals who were less competitive in the job market.

        "description":"Current theory in community education holds that community education programs should move from a &quot;program&quot; orientation to a &quot;process&quot; orientation--process being defined vaguely as an open democratic structure. Three long-running community education projects in rural communities were studied for evidence of this phenomenon. Data were collected by interviewing first knowledgeable respondents and then interviewing people named by the knowledgeable people; a total of 114 interviews were conducted. Interviewees were asked about their relationship to community education, to others in the projects, names of those involved in the projects, effectiveness of the projects, organizational linkages of the project to other community agencies, and what works and what needs improvement in the  community education program. Based on an analysis of this data, the researchers concluded that there is no evidence to support the notion that community education develops in a progressive manner from program to process. However, there was evidence to support the idea that as community education projects mature, they tend to develop an open bureaucratic process. The researchers suggest the community educators may have to be content with this open bureaucratic system rather than striving for the ideal of a democratic process system. (KC)",

        "description":"Productivity is a major issue in every discussion about the national economy. There is growing evidence that lagging productivity is one of the roots of the national economic slowdown, manifested in high rates of inflation and unemployment, increased federal deficits, and in reduced ability to compete in international markets. Many economists believe that the United States needs a new framework for economic understanding in order to bring back productivity. The economists recommended investment in both human and technological capital. Community and technical colleges have vital roles to play in developing human resources; they are the only existing system for delivering much of the needed training to working adults. It will be essential for colleges to establish closer  collaboration with business and industry, to support fast-response training programs, and continually to assess the needs of the business and industries of their areas. It will be crucial for the decision makers of the community and technical colleges to understand the training needs and the emerging management practices that are being used by business and industry to improve productivity and the quality of work life. Two of these practices are job retraining and employee participation, and both could require training that could be delivered through collaboration between business, industry, and community and technical colleges. (The paper identifies the emerging training needs that will be crucial in the years to come and provides practical suggestions for strengthening community  college-business ties.) (KC)",

This effort has largely been based on economic necessity, since the numbers of traditionally aged college students (18-22) have fallen. Extension and continuing education for adult students is not completely new to higher education, having been introduced in this country in the 1870s by England's Cambridge University, although in recent years many institutions are becoming involved for the first time. In most instances, extension and continuing education have been less than full partners in the university community. The recent emphasis on the parttime adult student tends to suggest that continuing education is closer to reaching its potential than ever before.  However, complete fruition is not yet in sight. Therefore, it is imperative that continuing education personnel continue to push for total university support of their program in order to maximize benefits for their constituents and themselves.

Chapter 1 focuses on identifying diagnostic tests of basic skills in reading, mathematics, and communication. It discusses the concept of diagnosis and criteria for selecting tests. Four types of diagnostic tests are described: (criterion-referenced, norm-referenced, custom-made or made-to-order, objectives-based item banks), and suitable tests of each type are named. How diagnostic testing will be presented in the Resource and Teacher Guides of the project, Teaching Basic Skills Through Vocational Education, is considered. Chapter 2 focuses on competency  instruments to assess students' basic skills. It reviews requirements faced by students for proficiency in basic skills and then discusses each set of requirements in terms of the competency instruments recommended for its assessment. Recommendations are made for inclusion of assessment instruments in the Guides. Appendixes include a list of norm-referenced tests that were screened out, format for test review, list of tests on basic skills that have vocationally relevant testing materials built in, and references related to readability analysis.

The training of NAs and NFOs is extremely time consuming and complex. It requires extensive planning and constant monitoring to ensure efficient and effective use of available resources. The use of the RPS model is based on a roll back technique in which the desired output of NAs/NFOs is given as the independent variable. Then using a specified predetermined training time and attrition rate, the model determines the number of students that must enter the pipeline and the number of support personnel, instructors, and aircraft required  for each training wing to meet the training objective.

The results indicated that (1) marginally literate men (MLM) reading at the fifth grade level on a standardized reading test performed comparably to typical fourth and fifth grade students on tests of comprehension by auding and reading when the materials were presented at 128 words per minute; (2) MLM reading near the fifth grade level performed more poorly than typical fifth graders on tests of learning from audio-visual materials; (3) MLM  showed approximately 0.5 to 1.0 years of reading potential on an auding and reading test; (4) MLM in a military job-related reading program of 6-weeks' length showed a median gain of 0.7 grade levels in general reading and 1.6 levels in job-related reading--there was no relationship of reading potential to gain. From these findings it was concluded that one should not assume that adult literacy students will perform better or learn more quickly than children at comparable reading levels. It was also decided, however, that adults learned job-related reading more quickly than general reading skills. (KC)",

The distribution of auding and reading skills in the population that applies for military service was first determined by administering the LAB test to more than 4,500 applicants for service; these scores were normed and related to other literacy tests and composite scores of the ASVAB. It was found that auding and reading are highly correlated, indicating that people who are unskilled at reading are the least skilled in comprehending oral language also. However, for the lowest-scoring populations,  the lower the reading skill, the more likely the auding skills were better. The predictive validity study showed the value of the LAB for predicting qualification status, predicting attrition, and predicting promotion (although education level emerged as the best single predictor of promotion). It was concluded that understanding the nature of literacy and the relationships of literacy to aptitude assessment can lead to improvements in selection and classification. The LAB should continue to be used in conjunction with the ASVAB to predict success in training schools where the demands for literacy and oracy skills are higher than on the job. (KC)",

Their students then used the handbook and Student Profile to summarize their aptitudes and attitudes as related to correlated occupations. It was concluded that students and their families could become self-directed with minimum counselor contact. The cognitive student-family-school approach recommended was found to be defensible. Positive evaluation results were received from counselors who  participated in the workshop, counselor interviews, parent surveys, administrator/counselor interviews, three non-high school sites, and student taxonomy of learning.

Major findings and conclusions of the study were the following: (1) II and CI were found to be equally effective in preparing sailors for operational fleet jobs; (2) within the II category, self-paced and computer-managed instruction were found to be equally effective training methods; (3) II benefited higher ability students more than it did lower ability  students; (4) no evidence was obtained concerning which method of instruction most benefited lower ability personnel; (5) CI did not benefit one ability level of students over another; and (6) whether CI or II was more effective in teaching training tasks depended on course content. It was inferred from the study that training time, and thus cost, could be reduced by converting current CI courses to an II format--at least for higher mental ability students.

During the hearing it was alleged that certain Department of Labor officials had blocked needed audits of questionable programs for political reasons. It was also alleged that certain CETA funded programs had grossly mismanaged their funds, resulting in waste and possible fraud. Programs in Washington, D.C. and South Carolina were especially noted as questionable and needing audits.

The Committees sought answers to the question of how the federal government should participate in building an effective and efficient work force. Witnesses who spoke at the hearings included Governor Pierre Du Pont of Delaware; Albert Angrisani and Robert Worthington, both Assistant Secretaries of Labor; Senator Larry Pressler of South Dakota; and representatives from the St. Louis Public Schools and the state education department of South Carolina. Governor Du Pont described Jobs for Delaware Graduates, a program for placing high school graduates and following up on them for 9 months, at a cost of only $1,500 per placement,  compared to $6,000 to $15,000 for Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) programs and others. The program is being expanded nationwide as Jobs for America's Graduates. Angrisani and Worthington spoke about the need to coordinate vocational education and CETA programs, perhaps with vocational education playing the coordinating role. South Dakota has a very successful program of vocational education, according to Senator Pressler, with more than $12 in economic development realized for every $1 spent on training programs; however, federal regulations should be made less cumbersome in regards to funds distribution. The St. Louis and South Carolina representatives testified about effective programs in their areas linking vocational education and the private sector.

        "description":"A study examined the impacts of the Youth Apprenticeship Projects (YAPs) upon student apprentices and employers. Post-high school interviews were conducted with 845 student apprentices from 1978-80, 621 students in a control group, and 347 employers. Interview response rate for all students averaged 76%, for employers--92%. Students who participated in the YAPs reported higher levels of job satisfaction and tended to be more occupationally stable than comparison students. They did not earn significantly higher wages. Those student aprentices who stayed with their apprenticeships after high school tended to be better job performers. Student apprentices reported very high levels of satisfaction and strongly endorsed the project. They did not exhibit different or fewer  school-to-work transition problems. The organizations that employed student apprentices were very small businesses with neither union representation nor prior experience with apprenticeship. Employers were attracted more by emphasis on screening and training of entry-level workers than by stipends offered and were very satisfied with the projects. Employers with prior apprenticeship experience were more likely to consider apprenticeship permanent and provide related instruction for graduate apprentices. (YLB)",

Section 1 overviews apprenticeship-school linkage. In section 2 factors are described that should be considered during the planning phase, including choosing a task force, allotting time for planning, school involvement, industrial involvement, goal setting, size/scope of project, targeting, legal concerns, and organization and structure. Section 3 focuses on activities, staff selection and training, project promotion, linking with schools, student recruitment, and job development. Project administration is the focus of  section 4. It considers coordination of roles and responsibilities with registration agency staff; monitoring, accountability, and control; registration activities; staffing; single versus mutiple school district involvement; state variation in policy and law; and related instruction and transition. Section 5 highlights basic management principles. Section 6 describes contractor types and their strengths and weaknesses: state education agencies, postsecondary institutions, single school system, and private, non-profit corporations. Alternative administrative models are summarized. Appendixes include project summaries and a glossary. (YLB)",

        "description":"The New Youth Initiatives in Apprenticeship Program (YAP) was compared with the Youth Career Development Program (YCD). Data for 1979 and 1980 came from an evaluation of YAP projects by CSR, Incorporated, and an evaluation of the YCD projects by the Educational Testing Service. A multiple regression approach was used to compare student characteristics, effects of participating in YCD and YAP, and effects of participation on a variety of outcomes. Due to program focuses, YAP and YCD had different client groups. YAP clients were predominantly male and white, YCD clients--female and black. YAP participants were likely to have a substantial advantage in obtaining employment. Analyses indicated participants' sex and race were more strongly associated with employment outcomes than  differences in program impact. YAP and YCD participants with employment experience exhibited relatively high job satisfaction scores and the lowest level of satisfaction with their pay. YAP participation did seem to lead to greater job satisfaction. Supervisors of both groups appeared to give approximately equal ratings to participants. Comparative analyses did not provide strong evidence of program impact by either demonstration concept, nor did comparisons reveal sharp differences in program impacts.

        "description":"This study analyzes the mobility of workers initially employed in low-paid occupations who moved to moderately paid occupations, based on 18,347 observations of 1970 Census data, compared to 1965 data. The study relies on the concept of labor segment, which provides an antidote to the individualistic perspective. Two broad segments, a low-paid and a mainstream stratum, are defined in order to operationalize mobility of the type that might lift a family or individual out of poverty. To permit investigation of effects due to race, gender, and industrial sector, the low-paid stratum is subdivided into eight labor segments. In its linear form, the mobility model specifies that for each labor segment the probability of upward mobility is the sum of three effects: age, years of  schooling, and current occupations. The estimates indicate that the chances for upward mobility differ across low-paid occupations. In addition, there are large effects for race and gender, and a substantial effect of industrial sector on black males. The mobility flows examined through the large data base show the operation of segmentation factors. The results support the segmentation view of the labor market, i.e., a person's life chances are factors other than his or her productive potential. Socioeconomic inequality is exacerbated because gender, race, industry, and occupation are determinants of mobility. (KC)",

        "description":"This project examined the careers of a one percent sample of federal civil servants for the years 1963 through 1977. The areas of employment investigated included economic returns to schooling and experience, factors affecting promotion and turnover, and occupational career ladders. A series of hypotheses and objectives specified at the outset were subjected to multivariate statistical analysis using the official personnel records of more than 68,000 federal employees. The results show that the main conclusions of human capital research in economics and status attainment research in sociology hold for the federal government. However, internal labor market characteristics must also be considered for a full understanding of civil service careers. The findings suggest that mobility  between major occupational categories is infrequent in the federal service, and that when it does occur the attributes of origin and destination jobs are not similar. Attribute continuity is greatest for mobility involving a change of grade or detailed occupation without a change of major categories, for employees in mid-career, not new entrants, and for two of the nine attributes considered--knowledge required by the job and its physical demands. The implication for educational practice is that a concern for teaching transferable skills to prepare students for a career of occupational change should not sacrifice thorough mastery of specific subject matters.

The project attempted to measure the value of on-the-job learning in terms of future income and to identify sequences of occupations which would maximize the value of the young person's experience. Instead, the project found that the premise is not correct. Individual differences in on-the-job learning do not, on the average, result in differences in earnings. While work experience, measured as the length of time a person has worked, has a substantial positive impact on a person's earnings, the impact does not come from individual differences in job-acquired skills. Therefore, the  project's first proposal for individualized simulations of young people's entry into the work force was not needed. The same advice can be given to all: Start work early in as highly paid an occupation as possible and work continuously at it; the connection between learning and earning is a loose one. (Research for the study was conducted through a literature review and longitudinal surveys. Ways were devised to use all available information in a longitudinal survey, and a method of measuring on-the-job learning was devised.) (Author/KC)",

        "description":"A developing concern in Minnesota for the fact that a greater percentage of special needs students than non-special needs students tends to drop out of postsecondary vocational education prompted a project to promote articulation--transition--for these students into postsecondary education. A statewide survey was conducted to determine current articulation efforts aimed at facilitating the entry of special needs students into postsecondary vocational institutions, and a national survey was carried out to determine the availability of formal articulation programs and/or efforts. The results of these activities clearly demonstrated that additional efforts must be focused on this topic. A third activity was the assembly of a national symposium that focused on several aspects of the  articulation question, such as development of a sound transition model, school policies and information needs, preparation of vocational educators to implement transition efforts, and development of formal, flexible transition policies and practices. The final project activity was the development of a conceptual model of articulation. The model employs ideas from various disciplines, including health care services delivery, vocational rehabilitation, and vocational psychology. It is based on the concept that the needs and resources of students and institutions must correspond; without this correspondence, students are likely to leave the program. The model developed through this project presents a rationale for helping educators to determine how to select transition services and how to  provide them, based on the stragegies of correction, compensation, and circumvention.

        "description":"This paper presents a literature review and the author's views on the male role in parenting, including the choice not to parent. The traditional view of male parenting is reviewed, with an emphasis on the effects of the traditional paternal role on the development of children. The materials shift in focus to a broader consideration of the traditional male role, e.g., the hazards of the sex stereotyped male role including shorter life expectancy, unmet needs, and exposure to greater stress. Alternative roles are suggested, including increased involvement in parenting and participating as a co-parent in the nurturance and care of children. A third option is also proposed, i.e., a father role outside the nuclear family that encompasses single parent adoption or father custody in  divorce. The option not to parent is also considered in this review. (JAC)",

The negative attitudes associated with voluntary childlessness are discussed in a brief summary of recent literature. An exploration of the methodological limitations of existing research is included which emphasizes its usefulness for hypothesis formation and points to the need for more in-depth studies. A research strategy based in a theoretical foundation is outlined in terms of five propositions dealing with both the antecedents and consequences of fertility choices, including: (1) the husband's and wife's freedom from traditional sex role identification; (2) sex role identification and fertility values formed by experiences in the family of origin; (3)  decision-making patterns in the marriage; (4) the quality of a marriage without children; and (5) the potential for individual development in a childless marriage.

        "description":"Although research has identified leisure as a significant factor of individual well-being in different stages of adult life, there is little insight into how leisure behaviors and attitudes are acquired. A cross-sectional sample of 300 rural adults was interviewed. Leisure attitudes were assessed on a leisure ethic scale, and well-being was measured by self-reports of happiness, satisfaction, and health status. Standard demographic and socioeconomic data were also obtained. Subjects were asked to identify their favorite leisure activities, how they learned them, how long they had been doing them, and, if appropriate, why they discontinued any activities. In addition, subjects identified activities they would like to pursue. Results showed that the subjects were happy, satisfied,  in good health, and work-oriented. Outdoor pursuits ranked high as favorite activities, followed by reading, crafts, jobs, traveling, cards, and religious activities. Discontinued activities were physical in nature, and had been stopped because of health or age. Traveling was the most cited activity that subjects wished to pursue. The results indicate that early life experience is critical in the formation of leisure behaviors and attitudes, and the family is a major force in shaping early leisure behaviors. (Author/NRB)",

The first section identifies two basic assumptions of a systemic approach, i.e., that the unit of analysis is the system in which behaviors identified as problems occur, and that all systems operate under a set of implicit rules. The second section outlines three operational corollaries of these assumptions which explain how the underlying assumptions may be translated into systemic assessment and practice, i.e.,: (1) the family should be assessed as a unit and intervention should be planned to impact on the system; (2)  recurring behavioral patterns or loops should be identified and used to identify therapy goals; and (3) the system members' conceptualizations of themselves, the problem, and therapy should be assessed and used to frame or present interventions.

        "description":"Although research has provided evidence to document a relation between parental psychopathology and female delinquency, the dimensions of that relationship are unclear. Adjudicated delinquent females (N=48) completed a general social history interview and three psychological instruments. Probation records were used to analyze subjects' delinquent offense patterns and to obtain data on parents (history of drug/alcohol abuse, adult criminal record, treatment for psychiatric disorders). Results revealed four personality patterns among the girls: borderline, antisocial, neurotic, and socialized delinquents. Subjects with antisocial personalities were significantly more likely to have fathers with a record of psychiatric treatment than girls in the other three groups; they were also  more likely to have fathers who were alcoholics and substance abusers than girls with neurotic or borderline personalities. No index of maternal psychopathology was found to be significantly related to female delinquent personality patterns. All three measures of paternal psychopathology were significantly related to higher total delinquency scores in subjects. Only one measure of maternal psychopathology, a record of psychiatric treatment, was positively associated with an earlier age at first offense in girls, but not to any other index of offense. The results suggest that children reared by psychologically disturbed parents are \"at risk\" for the development of a wide range of behavior disorders. (Author/NRB)",

The retirement decision-making and perceptions about retirement among almost equal numbers of Blacks, Latinos, and Anglos (N=595) in Denver and San Diego were examined to investigate the appropriateness of the emerging minority retiree as a potential community resource. Subjects completed a standard field interview assessing: (1) socio-demographic characteristics; (2) labor force history; (3) familial, social, and community interaction and participation patterns; and (4) retirement attitudes, expectations, and behavior. Personnel (N=279) from San Diego County community organizations completed questionnaires about the staffing, programs, and involvement of the  elderly in their organizations. Major socio-economic variables suggested that Blacks and Latinos could anticipate a more disadvantaged retirement condition than Anglos. Low levels of formal education and occupational status and low income jobs among minorities had a potentially negative impact on retirement conditions. The findings suggest that there are wide discrepancies in the retirement experiences and attitudes of Blacks, Latinos, and Anglos. (NRB)",

To examine the impact of pubertal development on adolescents, data were used from a 5-year longitudinal study of white males and females. A variety of self-concept, behavioral, value, and attitudinal measures indicated that for a substantial number of those dimensions, pubertal development had no effect. Early physical development was a mixed blessing for girls in terms of opposite sex popularity and greater independence but a disadvantage in terms of dissatisfaction with their body image, lower academic success, and problem behavior. For males, early development was more of an advantage linked to higher self-esteem  and a more stable self-image. The findings are generally consistent with the results from other research. (JAC)",

Leadership research across cultures provides the opportunity to test the universality of leadership theories and also the opportunity to broaden those theories through the inclusion of a wider range of variables than are available in a single society. While the study of social organization at the \"macro\" level is not usually within the scope of social psychologists, an examination of the leadership theories of the  behavioral scientist-anthropologists, political anthropologists, sociologists - yields valuable insights for cross-cultural leadership research.

In light of previous findings that many older workers prefer part-time employment, an intensive study was conducted of the policies of one company and its employees' attitudes. Participants expected to retire at 64 or 65 but the preferred retirement age was 62. Only 8 percent expected to retire because of poor health. Early retirement was of interest to the employees primarily because of the opportunity to pursue leisure activities. More than half reported that the economy affected retirement plans and two-thirds reported a preference for part-time work as a transition toward retirement. Older workers were interested in improving their pension  benefits during retirement in contrast to earning higher salaries or improved fringe benefits while working. The results suggest a need to reassess the value and productivity of older workers. (JAC)",

        "description":"Although student evaluation of instruction forms are used by colleges to provide information to instructors and administrators, personality and cognitive style variables of the student raters are rarely considered. A cognitive developmental measure, the Paragraph Completion Test (PCT), two cognitive style measures, Bieri's Modified Rep Test and the Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT), and an evaluation of instruction questionnaire that included two cognitive developmental items were administered to 497 undergraduates in 18 classes. Results of intertest analyses indicated that cognitive developmental measures were positively correlated with each other but not significantly correlated with cognitive style measures. None of the measures were systematically related to sex, and only  the PCT was positively correlated with grade point average. Complexity of student questionnaire ratings was positively correlated with two of the Rep Test cognitive complexity measures and with both cognitive developmental items, and was negatively correlated with GEFT scores. The results suggest that further development of cognitive developmental items for inclusion in evaluation of instruction questionnaires is needed. (Author/NRB)",

Since patterns of age segregation exist within communities, such segregation may result in similar social benefits. Interviews (N=1,185) assessing social networks were conducted with persons aged 60 and older. Two measures of neighborhood age structure were used to determine the age segregation of neighborhoods. Results indicated that, although children were preferred for instrumental and expressive supports, neighbors were frequently used for both types of support and were substituted for unavailable children for instrumental help. Whether neighbors were chosen for instrumental or expressive help appeared  to contribute little to overall well-being. General involvement in neighborhood networks showed similar patterns. Closest neighbors and neighbors who were confidants tended to be age peers, with age being less important for instrumental or emergency help. Living in an age-segregated neighborhood had little relation to getting instrumental or expressive support from neighbors or to general involvement with neighbors. The results provide little evidence that residential age segregation contributed to overall well-being. (NRB)",

The Situational Attitude Scale-Women (SASW) was developed to overcome this methodological difficulty. The SASW consists of two parallel forms, one containing neutral situations involving &quot;a person&quot; and one containing situations involving &quot;a woman.&quot; These two forms control for positive bias. The SASW was completed by 334 college freshmen. Results showed that 55 of the 100 items on the SASW elicited responses which were significantly different by form and 48 items elicited responses which differed significantly by sex of respondent. Interactions (N=32) between form and sex of respondent were found to be significant. While many of the  attitudes toward women in various situations were positive, much of this positivity may be interpreted as attributable to sex stereotyping. (Author/NRB)",

Three general models which researchers can use for evaluating worker potential across the life-span are offered. Each model is reviewed briefly and comments are given. The first two models presented belong to the functional age approach, with a focus on normative age grouping and a performance analysis at  specific ages, while the third model offers an alternative strategy, job analysis of attributes, abilities, and minimum performance, for assessing worker competency across the life-span. Model Three is discussed in greater detail and includes a list of eight steps to consider in all validation procedures where older workers are evaluated.

In order to develop a program to meet the overall needs of these students, an inventory of student trends was necessary. The inventory included three activities. A survey was conducted of second-year students currently enrolled in the Engineering Science and Engineering Technology programs. This survey yielded a base line, established the existing goals and areas of interest of the current student  population. A survey of graduates of the Engineering Technology and Engineering Science programs from 1973 through 1978 was conducted to determine past trends with respect to each of these programs. This survey was compared with the survey of current students in order to determine the reliability of the survey and the significant variations between current and past students. A survey of the four-year engineering technical colleges which accept most of the graduates from Westchester Community College's programs was conducted.

This volume contains notes developed for a course in active remote sensing. It is concerned with those methods or systems which generate the electromagnetic energy &quot;illuminating&quot; the target or resource to be detected. It attempts to provide guidance in the development of theories to support experimental results, and to bring together information useful to both the engineer and the resource manager. A primary aim of the course is to train students to use their own judgment about the value of a remote sensing system for a particular application. The notes include a short course in electromagnetics and a review  of electromagnetic properties of natural materials. These tools are used to study the interaction between natural resource targets and the electromagnetic energy from active systems. Typical images and other types of data are examined to understand experimental results. (Author)",

A summer conference trained the on-campus participant faculty in the use of the truck-laboratory as well as in trouble-shooting techniques with the instruments to be used. Two instruments were permanently mounted due to temperature and vacuum requirements. Four other instruments were fitted into detachable drawers so they could be used inside the permanent laboratories of the participating schools or moved independently of the mobile laboratory. To encourage cooperation among participating schools, each was free to alter, maintain, or  adjust its curriculum. A schedule for movement of the vehicle was made each year by the participants, which also served to foster an increased cooperation among participants. Evaluation conferences were held at the end of the summer after the first two years and an outside panel, listening to accounts of experiences, judged it a success and recommended it for duplication. Newspaper and professional articles, television news coverage, and the presence of the van at national meetings helped to publicize the project. (Author/JN)",

Fall semester 1980 was scheduled for planning, spring 1980-81 for the pilot phase, and the 1981-82 school year the experimental phase. The two target populations were: (1) able tenth and eleventh graders, and (2) mathematically low-achieving sixth graders. The many problems that have occurred during program implementation were noted. The view expressed is that, given the purposes of the pilot study, the  difficulties, and the fact that some of the data from the pilot phase is incomplete, the results obtained to date are encouraging. The potential for long-term impact on the motivation and achievement of students by activities directly related to the project are seen to be great. The goals of the pilot phase are considered achieved, and significant positive change with respect to achievement, attitude, and enrollment are anticipated in the experimental phase. (MP)",

Hovland's research provided information that communicators who were perceived as being highly credible and authoritative are more likely to produce greater attitude change than are communicators perceived as less credible and authoritative. A one-group pretest-posttest-posttest test time series research design was used with 25 preservice elementary education students enrolled in a science methods course. Treatment consisted of: (1) on-campus methods instruction and science unit planning during weeks 1-7 of one quarter; (2) in-field preservice elementary teacher science instruction of pupils in local elementary schools during weeks 8-10; and (3)  an on-campus science fair and evaluative feedback sessions during the final week of the quarter. Preservice students' attitudes toward elementary science teaching and toward science were measured with Moore's Science Teaching Attitude Scales instrument while perceptions of communicator credibility were measured by the semantic differential technique in the form of the Perceptions of Communicator Attitudes instrument. The investigator concluded, after data analysis, that Hovland's principle is important to attitude change but that credibility is not the main cause for change. (PB)",

The IIEP employs an objective-referenced approach, with desired student performance expressed in terms of objectives. Students to be tested are selected in a two-stage random sampling method. Since the IIEP is geared towards determining how groups of Illinois students perform on given tasks, no individual student, teacher, or school district is identified. As part of the study, teachers of participating students were asked to estimate  the percentage of students who would obtain correct answers to individual test items. Of the eight measured objectives, it was found that teacher estimates were significantly higher than student performance for only one objective. (MP)",

The IIEP employs an objective-referenced approach, with desired student performance expressed in terms of objectives. Students to be tested are selected in a two-stage random sampling method. Since the IIEP is geared towards determining how groups of Illinois students perform on given tasks, no individual student, teacher, school, or district is identified. As part of the study, teachers of participating students were asked to  estimate the percentage of students who would obtain correct answers to individual test items. Of five objectives containing three or more items, teacher estimates were higher than student performance in all cases, but the difference was only statistically significant for one objective. (MP)",

        "description":"This study is concerned with certain features of the curriculum decision-making process including ways in which alternatives are argued, the types of reasons entertained for preferring one option over another, and the basis on which some proposals are ultimately accepted and others rejected. It is argued that, with respect to these features, curriculum theory in its present state appears unable to provide a basis for an adequate understanding of the curriculum decision-making process. On the basis of two conceptual features which form the theoretical foundation of the study and using the philosophical analyses of rational argument (by Toulmin) and of the deliberative process (by Baier), a framework is developed for the analysis of the discourse of curriculum policy deliberation.  This framework was tested through the analysis of transcribed samples of deliberation obtained from a science curriculum committee. This analysis allowed both the identification of the logical elements of deliberative discourse and also a discussion of their relationship. Following this trial analysis, the framework was appraised and refined in light of the appraisal. A discussion of the theoretical and practical significance of the research concludes the dissertation. (Author/JN)",

It presents background materials for the teacher, 22 sample lessons drawn from various curriculum projects, and a bibliography of law-related resources. The document is presented in three major sections. In the first section, the guide is introduced and a rationale for law-related education is presented. In addition, the teaching strategies used in the sample lessons are introduced. The second section offers sample lessons on five topics--the need for law, freedom, authority, fairness, and conflict. Students are involved in a wide variety of activities, including playing educational games, roleplaying, analyzing literary works such as \"The  Tale of Peter Rabbit\" for relevant legal concepts, filling in charts and graphs, answering questions orally and in writing about case studies presented as part of several lessons, and devising rules to regulate class behavior. For each activity, information is presented on background, objectives, procedures, and reading selections. In the final section, suggestions are made to help teachers obtain and use a variety of outside resources for teaching law-related education. Suggestions refer to curriculum packages, ideas for using law-related resource people, and field-work in the school and/or classroom. The document concludes with a bibliography of children's books that lend themselves to teaching legal concepts. (Author/DB)",

In its third year of operation, the project is designed to integrate education about aging with the general curriculum for all K-12 students and to promote opportunities for intergenerational contact between people of different ages. The project has been evaluated by the Educational Testing Service and validated for diffusion by the Massachusetts Department of Education. A description of project activities follows. A 30-hour inservice course for teachers has been developed. In the course, teachers explore attitudes about aging and the aging process and related political and economic issues and review models and materials for the classroom. To date 120 teachers  have completed this course. Curriculum workshops to help teachers integrate information about aging into their regular curriculum are being conducted for teachers who complete the inservice. The project has developed many publications including a sourcebook for teachers, an analysis kit on &quot;Ageism in Literature,&quot; an annotated bibliography of literature on aging categorized by grade levels, and curriculum plans for teachers. To involve the community, the project has sponsored a variety of special programs and events. Senior citizens serve as aides, tutors, guest speakers, and demonstrators of crafts and skills. A resource center library on aging has been developed. The project is now offering its consulting services including teacher training and curriculum materials to other communities  which are interested in adopting programs on aging education.

During the lifetimes of present students, the population 65 and over will grow from 11% to 20%. Most children now in school will live well beyond their 70th birthday. There is, therefore, a critical need to prepare this longest-lived generation for life in an older society, to foster more positive attitudes toward older people, and to increase understanding of aging and related issues. The sourcebook is comprised of seven chapters, each of which treats a particular topic. These are: what it means to grow old, attitudes about aging, aging in other times and places, the economics of aging, work and retirement, politics and aging,  and longevity and the future. The format of each chapter is essentially the same, containing the following components relating to each topic: a narrative review of current information, a chapter summary in the form of myths and facts, a set of suggested learning activities, a glossary, and recommended readings for further study. Suggested learning activities are many and varied and include having students conduct oral history interviews with an elderly person, select and discuss quotations about aging, analyze advertisements in terms of images of age groups, and analyze statistics. The sourcebook concludes with an extensive bibliography of additional resources including books, articles, curriculum materials, audiovisual resources, government publications, and organizational resources.

The activities are designed to challenge the prevailing myths about growing old, to provide students with better information, and to foster more positive attitudes about older people. In the first activity, which will take about five class periods, students clarify their values about aging and analyze the vehicles through which these attitudes are transmitted in society. Students take tests of knowledge and attitudes about aging, analyze ageist cartoons and advertisements, and discuss a film involving a conflict between teenage girls and an elderly shopping bag lady. The second activity, which will take approximately four class periods, involves direct interaction with elderly individuals who, by  their own personalities and behavior, challenge many of the perceptions the students are likely to have of older people. Older volunteers are invited to visit the class for small group rap sessions with students. In preparation for the discussions, the students and the older volunteers meet separately to generate questions each group would like to ask the other. The activity ends with a brief evaluation of the experience. The kind of information provided for each activity includes an overview, objectives, a list of materials needed (the activities are self-contained except for the film), a discussion of advance preparation, day-by-day teacher instructions, questions to stimulate classroom discussion (along with possible answers), and student handouts.

In the first activity &quot;Age/Sex Pyramids,&quot; students use population census data to construct age/sex pyramid graphs for the years 1960, 1975, and 2000. &quot;Age Dependency Ratio&quot; is examined in the second activity. Students compute age-dependency ratios for each of the age/sex pyramids and discuss possible effects on society. The age-dependency ratio is a number value that indicates the proportion of nonproducing numbers in a population compared to all members of that population. In an evaluation exercise for the first  two activities, students are required to construct an age/sex pyramid for Mexico, demonstrating their comprehension of the objectives of the first two activities, in a cross-cultural setting. The third activity deals with the &quot;Economics of Aging.&quot; Students examine data on the economics status of the elderly with a focus on social security and discuss alternative plans for meeting the future needs of the elderly. &quot;How Would You Vote?&quot; is the topic of the fourth activity. In a simulation game, students play the roles of elders making economic and political decisions and examine how shifts in population from one age cohort to another affect the political climate. The third and fourth activities are evaluated through a test and an oral review. Teachers' materials, transparencies, and student  handouts are provided for each activity. (Author/RM)",

The listing is meant to serve as a resource to educators who wish to develop positive attitudes in children and in adolescents about the elderly and about themselves. Educators should realize that both personal and societal attitudes held by authors are often reflected in their work. When this happens, books help to form and to reinforce the ideas that young people acquire about the aged, including how young people will approach their own aging. Therefore, to eradicate negative attitudes and to develop positive ones, it is imperative for educators to be careful when selecting books and to be aware of the images that  they convey to young readers. Books that present death as part of the life cycle have been included in the list. There are three major sections: Children's Literature, Kindergarten--Third Grade; Children's Literature, Fourth--Sixth Grades; and Literature, Seventh Grade--Adult. The kinds of materials listed include picture books, fiction, fables, legends, tall tales, short stories, reference biographies, and novels. (Author/RM)",

The major purpose of the TLA project was to help students understand aging and related issues and to foster more positive attitudes toward aging and older people. In all, 33 curriculum modules were implemented during 1980-81. Of these, eight modules, offered to youngsters at four grade levels (primary, elementary, junior high, and senior high) were selected for summative evaluation. In addition to grade level, modules were chosen to represent a number of schools, a variety of curriculum content, and differences in instructional approach. Each of the experimental units was matched with a  control group. For teachers, the experimental group was comprised of 33 K-12 teachers, two library assistants, and one clergyman. The project conducted an inservice course for these educators. Thirty-two teachers constituted the control group. The four evaluation instruments utilized are described in the report. Findings include the following. As a result of the TLA inservice course, teachers did demonstrate increased knowledge about aging. Of the seven curriculum units for which complete data sets are available, four had a statistically significant impact on students' attitudes toward aging, or understanding of the aging process and age related issues. Instruments are included in the appendix. (Author/RM)",

The first component, entitled &quot;Problems of Ageism in Literature,&quot; is a brief, but comprehensive, position paper on the particular ways in which literature may adversely affect the reader's attitudes about aging and older people. Literature has contributed toward educating children to the beliefs that older people are unimportant and that the later years are not an enjoyable time of life. This is also damaging to the elderly, as it destroys their self-esteem. Stereotyping of our older population is so subtle and so pervasive that replacing current ideas with factual information and positive attitudes is an enormous  task for teachers. Educators should not condemn all the literature containing stereotypic images or remove these books from the shelves. They must be sensitive to the issue of ageism and utilize critical-reading skills in evaluating prejudice. Things to look for in literature include illustrations, personality traits older people are said to have, their physical traits, behavioral characteristics, occupational role, character role, and ethnic and racial composition. The second component &quot;Analyzing Literature for Ageism&quot; offers a set of guidelines, instructions, and a simple instrument for analyzing materials in terms of ageist content. (Author/RM)",

The eight chapters cover objectives redevelopment, exercise creation, preparation of assessment  booklets, sampling, data collection, scoring, data analysis, and reporting. Each chapter explains the basic procedures used for the 1978-79 assessment and contrasts these procedures to those used in earlier years if there were changes. Appendices, which comprise over half of the handbook, contain materials covering definitions of reporting groups, forms used to gather background information about students and schools, response rates, computation of achievement measures and procedures for smoothing respondent weights.

Part two discusses the teaching assistantship programs which the 16 universities sponsored for their doctoral students. Successes and problems are noted. Part three describes the experiences of the doctoral students who participated in the program. Students filled out questionnaires and were interviewed about the effects of the program on their development as teachers. Teaching methods used in the training program are evaluated. Sixty percent of the students made strong positive statements about their development as teachers as a result of participation in the program. (Author/RM)",

Handouts regarding each provide information about the physical characteristics of the hazard, its geographical distribution in the United States, and the safety measures appropriate to reduce the rise of injury or death. The textbook used in the course is &quot;The Environment As Hazard&quot; by Burton, Kates, and White. To supplement course materials the student workbook was developed. Each of the 10 exercises comprising the  workbook begins with a brief introduction to the hazard. A brief discussion and/or supplemental reading are recommended before each exercise is begun by the students. Data prepared by federal agencies comprise the single most important source of information for the exercises. Many tables and maps are used. A discussion of certain hazards is augmented by case studies. To illustrate how different types of materials were utilized in developing the workbook, samples of exercises are included in the paper. For example, in one exercise students analyze a map depicting the average number of tornadoes by state for the period 1953-1978. In another exercise students plot the paths of six hurricanes that have affected the United States. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"This paper contains sample exercises that investigate weather and air quality relationships for use in college-level introductory courses in climatology and meteorology. The exercises will provide students with an opportunity to apply meteorological principles to a specific geographic location, in an effort to better understand the significant role that weather plays in enhancing or reducing air pollution levels. The first part of the paper discusses the general characteristics of the five air pollutants to be studied in the exercises--ozone, sulfur dioxide, total suspended particles, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide. The second half of the paper contains tables and graphs describing ozone pollution and weather conditions in Chicago and a detailed discussion of specific  methods that students can use to analyze these tables and graphs. This detailed discussion is intended to provide by example procedures that students can utilize in their investigation of the other four air pollutants. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"This report of President Carter's Commission for A National Agenda for the Eighties discusses the dynamics of American society and world affairs that they believe will determine events in the 1980s. The analytical report of the Commission was accomplished by 45 Americans, a bipartisan group representing business and labor, science and the humanities, arts and communication. There are three parts to the report. Part one, Overview, discusses new realities and changing priorities, defines and measures progress toward quality of life and examines prospects for the improvement of well-being. Part two, Themes, examines our legacy of rapid growth, the new economic era, choices for the 1980s, the slower growth society, the entitlement program, helping families to help themselves,  symptoms of discontent, and cultivating civic concern. Part three, Conclusions, discusses prospects and predicaments for the 1980s. A profound readjustment of attitudes, values, and expectations is underway. No matter how successful the nation is in attaining more rapid economic growth, there is no way of returning to the realities of the postwar era of dynamic growth. Some truly fundamental changes have taken place since then. The new realities that America faces in the 1980s require certain traits in its citizens that are by no means easy to cultivate. The ability of our society to solve its problems depends on the character of the American people. (Author/RM)",

This history was written to provide a useful background for current efforts to reform the social studies. The paper, which consists of nine chapters, begins with a discussion of the meanings, definitions, and beginnings of social studies. The three factors that set the stage for the development of the social studies are examined: the rise of the public high school, the growth of the universities, and the emergence of professional societies. Chapter two examines the 1916 report and the 1920s. The American Historical Association (AHA) Commission on the social studies and the 1930s are treated in chapter three. Chapter four examines the effect that World War II had on  the social studies. The &quot;New Social Studies&quot; movement is the topic of chapters five, six, and seven. What happened in the 1970s is discussed in chapter eight. Following the summary and comments of chapter nine, there are name and subject indexes. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"Designed to supplement undergraduate college geography courses, this paper discusses a particular type of territorial division--the administrative area within a state. The study of administrative patterns allows geographers to formulate and test hypotheses about man's organization of space, and also to assist in a very practical way by applying his knowledge to real world problems. All states, with the exception of only the very smallest, are divided for the purpose of internal administration into smaller units. With an increasing proportion of the world's population becoming concentrated in urban centers there is a pressing need to examine the spatial administrative structures which have been defined to delimit service areas of many public facilities, such as fire and police  protection, education, health, and welfare. In many large metropolitan areas services are paid for by the residents of one municipality but these same services are enjoyed by people in neighboring municipalities. The problem becomes more complex when individual demands for services and daily movement patterns of consumers are considered. This paper examines the spatial aspects of administrative systems. The problems of how large the administrative area should be is examined and the contributions of disciplines related to geography are mentioned. The development of administrative structures over time is also discussed. (Author/RM)",

The colorful and rhythmic series explores the black musical heritage from its African roots to its wide influence in modern American music. Each program of the series features performances and discussion by talented contemporary entertainers, plus film clips and still photo sequences of famous black performers of the past. This publication is divided into three sections: language arts, history, and the humanities. Each section begins with a scope and sequence outline. Examples of lesson activities follow. In the language arts lessons, students identify the point of view of the  lyricist in selected songs by blacks, participate in debate, give speeches, view and write a brief summary of the key concepts in a given television program, and create a dramatic scene based on a song lyric. The history lessons involve students in identifying characteristics of West African culture reflected in the music of black people, examining slavery, analyzing the music of post-Civil War America, and comparing the manner in which musical styles reflect social and political forces. A multicultural unit on dance and poetry is provided for humanities courses. Students learn that dance and poetry document various forms of cultural expression. (Author/RM)",

This supportive inservice model proceeds from the premise that meaningful change occurs when the individual perceives a need for change. The major component of this program is a support group of tenured teachers meeting weekly for one school semester. The function of the group is to establish a non-threatening environment where individuals can pose problems and work through possible solutions. Each teacher works in his or her own area of interest. Participants formulate a personal set of priorities by clarifying their own concepts of teacher roles they most identify with. With the help of a visiting consultant, teachers are observed by their  peers by means of videotape recordings. The opportunity is given them to evaluate how their own classroom performance measures up to their previously identified priorities and role perceptions. The final element in this process, the generation of a professional improvement plan, is also done within the support group. These plans, similar to ones developed for children in special education, consist of objectives, resources, and activities for the teacher, and timelines for accomplishment. These become the responsibility of each participant once the inservice group completes its work at the end of the semester. (JD)",

        "description":"The consensus reached at a seminar of deans of schools of education was that inquiry and scholarship associated with the process of education undergird all other missions of schools of education. The terms inquiry and scholarship are interpreted to include research, development, evaluation, and dissemination as well as the responsiveness of academic programs to the emerging knowledge base. Factors that limit school of education involvement in inquiry and related activities include heavy teaching loads, the need to coordinate with field sites in clinical instruction, insistent pressures for curriculum revision, and low status given their research efforts by the parent institution. Emphasis is placed on improving the quality of faculty and students and on the responsibility of the  dean to exert leadership. This report of the seminar is divided into three sections. Section One contains a statement of belief concerning the role of scholarship and inquiry in professional education. Section Two provides an overview of education research and development and a review of issues that should be considered in fostering a commitment of schools of education to inquiry and scholarship. In Section Three, recommendations for increasing the capacity of schools of education to engage in and support inquiry are advanced. (JD)",

        "description":"One of the major concerns in educating children with exceptional needs in the public school is the extent to which these children are socially accepted by teachers and peers. It has been suggested that the teacher may influence students' perceptions of handicapped children and that attempts to improve the social position of these children depend upon the teacher. An examination was made of perceptions of misbehavior of mildly mentally retarded children by special education and regular teachers. Forty-three regular teachers and nineteen special education teachers responded to a questionnaire asking them to indicate their degree of tolerance of 51 classroom behaviors identified as inappropriate. In addition, they were asked questions on their sense of personal responsibility for a  student's behavior. Results of the study indicate that the special education teachers were more tolerant of inappropriate behaviors than were the regular class teachers, and were more likely to feel personally responsible for successfully coping with behavior problems. The reason for this may be that special education teachers feel more capable of influencing student outcomes because of specialized training. (JD)",

        "description":"Based upon several studies involving teacher trainees, Fuller (1969) posited that education students progress through a three-stage sequence of concerns during their training. First, they are concerned about themselves, and later they tend to become more concerned about their knowledge of the subject. Finally, they become concerned about their effect on the pupils they teach. This study investigated whether Fuller's concerns model would be applicable to the training experienced by health professionals. Two areas were investigated: (1) the three concerns stages of teachers and their similarity to the concerns experience of physical therapists; and (2) the progress of the physical therapists through the stages of the sequence and the similarity to the sequence proposed by Fuller.  Thirty-four physical therapy students and forty-eight practicing physical therapists were the subjects of the study. The instrument used was the Teacher Concerns Checklist, developed by George, Borich, and Fuller (1974), which was modified slightly to measure the concerns of physical therapists. Results indicated that physical therapy students and practitioners experienced the same three concerns stages as outlined by Fuller for teachers. The students and therapists also progressed through the stages in the same sequence that was proposed by Fuller. The results suggest that Fuller's concerns model is valid in professions other than education and has some implications for the training of health professionals. (JD)",

Chapter 1 presents background information on the NET program and gives a brief overview of the report. Chapter 2 describes the organizational framework of most nutrition programs and relates nutrition education activities to their hypothesized effects. Chapter 3 describes how the NET program is intended to work and how it has been implemented and investigates the implementation of programs from 1978 to 1980. Chapter 3 also reviews the legislative mandate behind the  national NET program and presents a status report on the program by summarizing findings from surveys of NET state coordinators and a sample of local project directors. Models of three state programs are presented to show the diversity of responses to the program at the state level. Chapter 4 addresses the impact of the NET programs in Georgia and Nebraska, comparing the programs to other nutrition education programs also funded through the NET program or through the Food and Nutrition Service (Department of Agriculture). Conclusions are drawn about the effects of the programs on childrens' nutrition-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. The final chapter sets forth the major conclusions of the report. (FG)",

The aim of this component is to enable prospective teachers to be aware of the needs of the changing school population and its cultural diversity. The ISU community-based field experience program is coordinated with on-campus course work that is designed to prepare the students for urban experience. Students are carefully screened before entering the program. Orientation for the program is conducted by the college faculty in cooperation with local community personnel, and efforts are made to allow students to develop cohesiveness as a group in cooperative and supportive patterns. Field assignments are community-based and emphasize contact with  multicultural urban populations in school and nonschool settings. The bulk of the field experiences take place in nonschool settings. Students work with professional staff in such programs as drug and mental health facilities and youth centers. This enables the prospective teachers to gain insight into the background and life realities of the urban students they will teach. In evaluating A description of a typical schedule of students in the program shows that they work in varied locations from 8:30 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. In order to evaluate the program, students were given the Cultural Attitude Inventory test and the Personality Orientation Inventory test both before and after the field experience. In both tests, the mean scores of the students changed favorably from one testing period to  the next, indicating development of a more positive attitude toward youth of different cultures. (JD)",

Anxiety, caused by a variety of reactions including low self image, threat to security, and fear, is a common element in stress and culture shock. The proposed model features a preservice field experience program that is entered prior to student teaching and also features anxiety in controlled circumstances. The model should be used in a culturally and ethnically diverse community. The first of four program components is an orientation week for students to become familiar with neighborhood programs and agencies. The second component is a nine-week field  experience in assigned settings, such as alternative schools, alcohol or drug prevention programs, and mental health facilities. Students should have a minimum of three different assignments each day, lasting from 8:00 a.m. through 10:00 p.m. Assignments should be based on three criteria: student skills and background, the needs of the participating agencies, and the type of experience the student needs. The elements of challenge, intensity, and variety should produce stressful situations. The third and fourth components provide the necessary support and feedback that enable the students to learn and benefit from their situations. The students form a network of support systems, a strategy they can later use as teachers. The program director should hold weekly seminars and supply  individual feedback to students. (FG)",

The job, other teachers, discipline issues, and characteristics of the school administration can all be potential stressors for teachers. Understanding the dynamics of teacher stress can be useful for school administrators in many ways. It provides them with a better understanding of their own and teachers' work lives; it can make them better supervisors and colleagues for teachers; it can also improve the effectiveness of the school. Administrators should know what causes teacher stress and how to reduce the stress; at the very least, they should understand why teachers react to the school environment. If each school administrator identified those aspects of managerial style and school  environment that are stress-producing and tried to alter these phenomena, stress reduction for teachers would be possible. Some ways of alleviating teacher stress are by providing: (1) role clarity; (2) equitable workload distribution; (3) accurate matching of skills to assignments; and (4) inservice education for needed skills.

Twenty-five public school teachers participated; sixteen of these were women and nine were men. The study was conducted through interviews with the teachers. Stressors were categorized under three broad categories: job-related factors, interpersonal factors, and general organizational factors. The interviews sought to determine the perceived role demands that an individual is unable to satisfy and the extent of symptoms of strain. Results indicated that quantitative role overload was the stress most frequently experienced by the subjects, followed by role ambiguity and role  conflict. Stressors generally tended to be more potent for women than for men. Job variety, job responsibility, and interpersonal characteristics were found to be salient stressors for women. No stressor appeared to be salient for men. Organizational stressors were minimally potent among both men and women. While women were more likely to report the experience of role stress than were men, stress resulted in the experience of psychological strain for both men and women. Stress had predictable effect on men. For women, however, role stress was inversely related to physiological and behavioral strain symptoms. (JD)",

        "description":"\"Migrations\" is a multi-ethnic, interdisciplinary approach to the exploration of ethnic heritage. Designed by the Teacher Center, Inc. (New Haven, Connecticut), the project is conceived on the principle that ethnic heritage can be a source of pride and unity for all members of a community. It provides an active link between the ethnicity of the community and that of its schools. A primary focus of \"Migrations\" is on celebrating, through folk arts and oral history, those attitudes and experiences which are basic and vital to the lives of all people. All aspects of the project revolve around a museum housing a collection of folk art objects and photographs and reflecting the major ethnic composition of the community. A traveling mini-museum is an active teaching tool that is taken  into classrooms and occasionally on road trips. This handbook contains photographs of the contents of the museum as well as descriptions of the activities of the center in which the project is based. These activities include providing advisory services to neighborhood schools, offering help to teachers in developing arts and crafts, projects and bringing older adults into the classroom as visiting lecturers. These visitors are of different ethnic backgrounds and are a source of folklore and oral history. Included in the handbook is a bibliography of books, films, slide/tapes and records, and other resources. (JD)",

SIS is based on the documented experiences, from the variety of perspectives of those involved in the teacher education process, and will be used for program planning, accreditation, and student advisement. There are four components to the system: (1) quantitative and descriptive records on each student; (2) assessments of candidates' skills by cooperating teachers, peers, and college supervisors; (3) narratives of the teacher education experience, in the form of summative, supervisor, and students' self analyses; and (4) descriptions of the context, or environment of on- and off-campus settings, by all those  involved in the learning experience. SIS is designed to monitor students' skill development at many stages and takes into consideration the interrelated factors that shape teachers. This document presents: the reasons for creating the SIS (Section I); the general background of the SIS (Section II); and the components of the SIS (Section III). Section IV of this document presents the instrumentation of the SIS, including tables describing the SIS components and a cross section of a stage in professional development illustrating the components.

        "description":"A standardized language arts achievement test can be used by language arts teachers as they plan the language arts curriculum, group pupils, individualize instruction, and identify pupils needing special help. Two interventions, training and process consultation, were used to identify the most effective method of training preservice elementary language arts teachers in the use of standardized tests. As a pretest, the student teachers were required to administer to their class a standardized language arts achievement test and to use the results in classroom planning in the nine weeks of their field experience. The student teachers were divided into three groups: Group I was the control group; the members in Group II were trained for three days in the use of standardized tests; and  Group III received the three days of training as well as process consultation, which provided intraclassroom guidance and supervision to individual teachers. Process consultation, combined with training in the use of standardized tests, was the most effective training situation, since nine of the twelve teachers in Group III showed increased knowledge of the uses of standardized tests and their results. In comparison, six of the twelve teachers in Group I demonstrated increased knowledge, and eight of the twelve teachers in Group II increased their knowledge scores. Group III teachers also showed greater changes in attitudes and used a greater variety of materials and approaches. (FG)",

The study also sought to locate attitude differences between school sites. An attitude scale was developed in five stages: (1) identifying the nature of the possible attitude factors from current literature, teacher interviews, and experiences with teachers during inservice programs; (2) writing attitude items that directly relate to these attitude factors; (3) pilot testing the items with inservice teachers; (4) analyzing the pilot data to verify the factors; and (5) selecting the items to be placed on the final version of the attitude scale. The scale was designed to elicit teachers' feelings or beliefs about what inservice programs  should or could do, their expectations developed as a result of past experiences, and their feelings about suggested changes or improvements. The final version contained 32 statements and was administered to 244 inservice teachers in three school districts. Although much of the variance in the results was unexplained, the attitude scale was sensitive to attitude differences between school sites. A factor analysis of the results displays the 32 questions and summarizes the responses of the subjects. (JD)",

The introduction in the first section provides background information on the use of the guide and explains its approach toward international education. In the second section, a broad overview is presented of issues and problems involved in securing human rights, and the third section compares human rights under different government forms: democracy, authoritarian dictatorship, and totalitarian dictatorship. In the fourth section, the focus is upon four human rights: (1) the right to due process and a fair trial; (2) freedom of association;  (3) freedom of the press; and (4) the right to vote. Each right is treated in a separate chapter. A pertinent section of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights is quoted, followed by a series of illustrative examples that briefly examine how the right is treated, in theory and in practice, under democratic, authoritarian, and totalitarian governments. Alternative examples and subjects for discussion and study are suggested. Finally, each chapter includes references and bibliographic citations for further information on the topic. The appendix includes the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, an overview of the United Nation's role in protecting human rights, and a list of suggested learning activities. (JD)",

        "description":"A cooperative venture between the University of West Florida and the Okaloosa County (Florida) school district addressed the concerns of two rural communities over changing school and community characteristics and the need for basic skills instruction for elementary and secondary school students. To meet and expand upon objectives of Teacher Corps graduate programs, a Graduate Program Task Force studied characteristics of the schools and the communities. It was decided that a field-based program would involve most faculty members in the graduate program, would have a direct impact on the school and community, and would cause faculty and interested community members to participate in appropriate preservice and inservice activities. Since no field-based graduate programs in  education existed at the university, courses were modified to meet the needs of the new program participants. Four Teacher Corps interns and 28 local teachers began the degree program in the fall of 1979. The program consisted of core courses, elective seminars, directed independent studies, and individual specializations culminating in a major project. The program was scheduled to allow a combination of coursework and classroom observation. Three major strategies were used to accomplish the goal of inservice education and staff development: (1) participation in an action research project or practicum; (2) use of an extended interaction partner system; and (3) development of a portfolio of competencies by the interns.

In 1979, language arts tests were added. These three test series comprise the Portland Achievement Levels Testing Program. The new tests were created by district personnel to measure student achievement based on the curriculum taught in Portland Public Schools. The first step in developing these tests was to define goals of the Portland curriculum from Grades 3 through 8 in reading, math and language arts. Next, test items were developed to measure the goals. The difficulty level of each item was determined through field testing. A single curriculum scale (Grades 3-8) was subdivided into smaller segments, and short tests were  developed. These short tests give scores that can be compared as if they were simply portions of one long test. One of the advantages of the testing program is that students are tested at their functional level; this helps ensure that the test will measure the students' achievement levels accurately. The Achievement Levels Tests help determine how well students are progressing toward important basic skills learning goals. (Author/GK)",

This model is applicable to other state programs faced with the challenge of teaching local educators to use their results. These ideas are based on realistic estimates of resources available locally. The use and reporting model is predicated on several assumptions: (1) test results should be used to help students learn; (2) members of the public have a right to know about their schools; (3) most local educators are not well trained in testing, or the use of test results in instruction;  (4) without training and motivation to use results, many local educators will ignore the results; (5) there are simple ways of using test results and these can be taught to local educators; and (6) the use of the results by the teachers and the principle and the reporting of the results at the district level to the school board and media and at the building level to the parents are very much interrelated.

Two types of stimuli were used: excerpts from actual negative and positive book reviews, and versions of those excerpts that were edited so that the balance of the reviews varied but the content did not. The results strongly supported the hypothesis. Negative reviewers were perceived as more intelligent, competent, and expert than positive reviewers, even when the content of the positive review was independently judged as being of higher quality and greater forcefulness. At the same time, in accord with previous research, negative reviewers were perceived as significantly less likeable than positive reviewers. The results on intelligence ratings are seen as  bolstering the self-presentational explanation of the tendency shown by intellectually insecure individuals to be negatively critical. The present methodology is contrasted to that of previous research which obtained apparently contradictory results. The phenomenon demonstrated here is explained in terms of implicational schemata.

        "description":"Academic psychology has long been composed of two disciplines, one experimental and one correlational. These two disciplines each developed their own method of studying structure in data: multidimensional scaling (MDS) and factor analysis. Both methods use similar kinds of input data, proximity measures on object pairs. Both represent the object structure in terms of spatial coordinates. When MDS and factor analysis are applied to the same test intercorrelation matrix, how do the results compare? In an analysis of ability data and an analysis of vocational interest data, two-dimensional, nonmetric MDS solutions were compared to three-factor, principal components solutions. In both analyses, the components solution contained a general factor with no counterpart among the scaling  dimensions. Loadings along the remaining two components closely resembled scale values along the two dimensions. Results suggest that if one compares a K-dimensional MDS solution to a (KTI) components analysis, the components analysis will often contain a general factor with no counterpart among the scaling dimensions; after applying an appropriate rotation and multiplicative constant to the MDS scale values, some or all of the remaining components will correspond to a dimension in the scaling solution.

Fifth and sixth grade students completed the SDQ and several other instruments. Factor analysis of their responses clearly demonstrated the seven factors that the SDQ was designed to measure. Teachers were also asked to evaluate each student's self-concept along the same seven dimensions, and a multitrait-multimethod analysis offered support for both the convergent and divergent validity of the self-concept dimensions. Not only was there substantial student-teacher agreement on the seven dimensions, but agreement on any one dimension was relatively independent of agreement on other dimensions. The pattern of  small correlations among the student self-concept dimensions was generally consistent with those observed for the teacher ratings and those predicted by the hierarchical model upon which the instrument was based. Student and teacher ratings of students' self-concept both showed similar and predictable correlations with attributions for academic achievement, sex of student and reading achievement, thus offering further support for the construct validity of the SDQ.

The goals of the survey, which were achieved, were gathering, categorizing, and analyzing information about evaluation use among elementary school decision makers. Most survey respondents agreed instructional and curricular issues were most important. It was found that most school decision makers did not frequently rely upon evaluations when they made decisions. Needs assessment evaluations were most helpful to school staff in identifying areas requiring attention. Evaluative data were used more frequently in curricular decisions and in those involving the bilingual program. The data did not usually enter into administrative, staff development, or personnel decisions. The level of evaluation utilization  increased in those decisions in which administrators participated. Refinements in the observations and data collection procedures directed toward underlying causes were suggested. The implications for future research on evaluation utilization and evaluation practice in the schools were discussed. The analyses conducted as part of this research have the potential to increase evaluation utilization at the local level. (DWH)",

        "description":"In recent research the assessment of worry and emotionality as separate components of test anxiety has become a salient point. Because of theoretical advances in this field it seems to be necessary to include both aspects in the measures that are used to assess test anxiety. Some literature on this distinction is available, but no longitudinal study is known that investigates the structural stability of both aspects as well as time-specific effects. In this paper, the structural equations approach to the multitrait-multioccasion case is used to obtain more information on this point. In addition, the question of causal predominance arises: does worry influence emotionality during a certain time period, or vice versa? This question was explored by cross-lagged panel analysis.

The student knowledge test was developed from the same general behavioral objectives as the teachers' test but modified to a level suitable for sixth grade students. The test was also used with a sample of tenth grade students to provide an estimate of knowledge gain and attitude changes which occur during the sixth to tenth grade period. Results indicated that although both males and females at the tenth grade scored higher than those at the sixth grade level, tenth grade females gained more over this period than did  their male classmates. Tenth grade females tended to be more certain of their nutrition knowledge than males. Student opinions, as well as knowledge, were sampled. Analyses of variance were computed for test results.

The role of school districts as consumers of these firms was studied. A description of the method of this study was divided into three sections. These included site selection, conduct of field research, and recording and analysis of data. The kinds of test school districts bought would influence what private testing firms produced. The standards by which districts selected and purchased standardized norm-referenced educational achievement tests were examined. The marketplace, rather than formal governance arrangements for meeting local school district testing needs, was discussed. Formal government agencies at the national level were limited in the extent to which  they could claim formal responsibility for developing a national test of educational achievement. Since formal authority over education is the responsibility of the state or local government, its national role would be constrained in the development or regulation of a national test. It was concluded that in the case of achievement testing, the marketplace may provide a degree of public control that formal public decision making and politics cannot. (DWH)",

This permits comparison of groups of examinees tested with the same instrument. The test may be biased if it is not measuring the same thing in comparable groups, if groups are responding to different aspects of the test items, or if cultural and linguistic issues take precedence. An empirical study of the question of bias as shown by these techniques was conducted. Five related schemes for the statistical analysis of bias were applied to the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills which was administered in either the English or Spanish language version at two levels of elementary school in bilingual education programs. The objectives measured were recall or recognition  ability, ability to translate or convert verbal or symbolic concepts, ability to comprehend concepts, ability to apply techniques, and ability to extend interpretation beyond stated information. The results indicated that several items in the tests showed strong evidence of bias, corroborated by a separate analysis of linguistic and cultural sources of bias for many items. (Author/DWH)",

This model assumes that the probability of a correct answer to an item is a function of two parameters, one representing the difficulty of the item and one representing the ability of the subject. The purpose of this paper is to explain a mathematical-statistical solution to the problem of separating the factor of item difficulty from person ability. Rasch's &quot;theory of specific objectivity&quot; is basically a theory of unidimensionality. It states that only one dimension should be measured at a time and all items should be homogeneous, or measure the same ability. Local stochastic independence is assumed. The Rasch model is compared to other test-theoretic models including  classical test-theory and other item-response models. In relation to a concrete example, it is demonstrated how the parameters in the model can be estimated and how the assumptions of the model can be tested. Possible areas of application of the Rasch model are discussed. (Author/DWH)",

The study focused on the possibility of pre-equating, that is, deriving the equating transformation prior to the final administration of the test. The three-parameter logistic model was postulated as the response model and its fit assessed at the item, subscore, and total score level. Minor problems were found at each of these levels but, on the whole, the three-parameter model was found to portray the data well. The adequacy of the equating provided by IRT procedures was investigated in two TSWE forms. It was concluded that pre-equating does not appear to present problems beyond those inherent to IRT-equating. (Author)",

Two different kinds of management-oriented information gathering activities were involved: &quot;evaluability assessment&quot; (Phase I) and &quot;rapid feedback evaluation&quot; (Phase II) to provide immediate information on program performance. The premise for the study was that it was inappropriate and unsound to attempt a formal program evaluation until an evaluability assessment had shown WEEAP was capable of functioning as intended and a rapid feedback evaluation, using readily available information, showed positive results. Chapter I summarizes the Phase I evaluability  assessment and discusses the purpose, scope, and general approach of the rapid feedback evaluation. Chapters II through VI present the results of the five separate assessment activities that comprised the rapid feedback evaluation. Chapter VII integrates these findings and recommends action steps that can be taken to improve program management and operation. (Author)",

Four principles are illustrated which, if employed as a basis for the review of a testing process, could result in significant changes in the way people think about tests and believe in their usefulness. These principles state that tests should be public, economical, related to instruction, and should offer  significant experiences to students. (Author/GK)",

Results of the studies provided evidence that sample duration is an important consideration in curriculum-based measurement because of its probable impact on variability and slope. Increasing sample duration from 30 seconds  to a three minute sample reduced day-to-day variability in performance and resulted in a more rapid increase in student performance. The results with respect to sampling from domains of differing sizes indicated that measurement samples drawn from smaller domains are more sensitive to variations in instruction, but somewhat more variable. The optimum daily measurement procedure would seem to involve sampling from a pool of stimulus items well beyond that defined by the short-term objectives, but not in excess of an annual goal.

This monograph is directed at a general audience. This is not a text on conducting program evaluation; it is a list of evaluative activities. If combined with a text on evaluation which covered basic philosophical, theoretical, and design issues, this monograph would provide the \"specifics\" for translating generalities into the tasks which face the college basic skills program administrator who must actually conduct an evaluation. Examples used in the  manuscript come from experiences in New Jersey and therefore do not provide a broad spectrum of studies geographically. At the end of this monograph is an annotated list of 32 studies conducted in colleges around the country. (Author/GK)",

Given in five parts: (1) introduction and overview; (2) definitions regarding dissemination; (3) framework for determining impact and evaluative questions; (4) application through a fictional situation and (5) summary, the guide is strictly an objective-based effort, based on the assumption that existing written objectives are valid. The actual dissemination is the process by which research and development information--materials, projects, methods--is moved from where it originates to the  potential user. The evaluation design must assess the impact by its positive or negative extent. Cost limitations are always a major concern, but within any given parameters, the treatment and methodology can be assessed. The Dissemination Analysis Group (DAG) has classified the spread, exchange, choice and implementation (through telling, showing, helping, training, involving and interviewing) of the research and development materials with focus on the difficulties that some categories denote action by disseminator, while others indicate action by the practitioner.

Subjects included two groups of beginning second graders from schools in two contrasting cities. Spelling results were scored both by VBE homophonous pairs and by individual words. The study found that blacks spelled significantly more of the VBE homophonous word pairs identically than did whites. Word pairs were categorized as identical, similar, or different. Spellings of individual words were analyzed according to the following categories: (1) correct and phonetic; (2) dialectal; (3) hypercorrect/intrusive; (4)  consonant; and (5) uninterpretable. The study is said to support the hypothesis that children who speak different dialects have different underlying phonological forms. (ML)",

Observational data were gathered on the interactions of 69 white children and 32 black children during the course of one semester. The study found considerably more cross-race peer interaction than have previous studies conducted in non-academic settings in interracial schools. Nonetheless, children interacted significantly more with peers of their own race than with peers of the other race. Planned comparisons revealed that this tendency was due to very strong own-race preferences among the girls. In contrast, boys interacted cross racially at approximately the rate that would be expected if race were not a factor in interactant choice. The interactions of males were predominantly mutual in  nature, while those of females were one-sided. Negative behavior characterized less than one percent of all interactions. An analysis of the orientation of the interactions suggested that cross-race interactions of all groups were more task related than within-race interactions. In turn, within-race interactions were more social in orientation than were cross-race interactions. (Author/APM)",

The method represents a response to the failure of previous desegregation attempts to elicit public support and provide equal educational opportunity. Following a finding by a court of de jure racial segregation, the proposed method would: remove all state-enforced racial barriers to open access to public schools; assure that students of all ethnic origins are provided equal and comparable educational opportunities; and eliminate the remaining vestiges of the prior dual systems. Although Reynolds acknowledges that no single desegregation technique provides  certain success, he identifies several potentially successful approaches. These include voluntary student transfer programs, magnet schools, enhanced curriculum requirements, faculty incentives, in-service training programs for teachers and administrators, school closings in systems with excess capacity, new construction in overcrowded systems, and modest adjustments to attendance zones.

These districts were selected as having, respectively, high, medium and low apparent levels of staff development activity. The study was designed primarily to construct a method for analyzing staff development programs in other school districts with a focus on organizational routines and related costs. Data were collected through interviews with school district personnel and through examination of pertinent documents. From the information collected, descriptions, analyses, and comparisons of the three school districts were made in terms of: numbers of teachers and pupils;  education expenditures and funding sources; organizational structure; staff development activities at central office, district, and school levels; teacher participation in staff development; and staff development expenditures. Analysis showed that patterns of actual staff development activity and resource allocation contradicted conventional ideas of how staff development is conducted. A major conclusion was that the weak political position of staff development and the organizational dynamics of school districts make unlikely any substantial reforms of actual staff development practices in the near future.

The case study was conducted jointly by the School District and Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to determine what variables contribute to reading achievement. Students from grades one through four in twenty-five schools were selected to participate in the study. Data was based on interviews with school administrators and teachers, and pupil records, and included information about the principal, the reading teacher, the classroom teacher and the school for each individual student. The process of planning and translating the results of the study into educational policy initiatives is discussed. The following factors were associated with this  process: (1) identification of clients; (2) vitality of the topic; (3) participant involvement; (4) technical quality; (5) reporting formats; (6) findings keyed to the decision process; (7) preparation of policy makers; (8) overcoming resistance; (9) the role of the ombudsman; and (10) the role of the entrepreneur.

        "description":"This paper presents the results of an exploratory study of the process of mobilizing and allocating resources for desegregation in large cities. Examined were the effects of budgetary constraints on school desegregation and desegregation impact on educational finance. Four urban school districts were selected for site reports. Section one of this study reviews the literature pertinent to the conceptualization of the research questions. Section two reviews and discusses methodological aspects of the study. Section three describes the findings in the school districts selected for study. A concluding section presents summary observations about relationships between budgets and desegregation. Presented in the site reports are: (1) an historical overview and assessment of current  financial status; (2) issues related to school closing and facilities plans; (3) issues related to the funding of magnet schools, staff development, multicultural curricula, and other programs related to desegregation; and (4) funding needs in the areas of transportation, safety and security, and school-community relations. This paper suggests that the broader political, economic, and legal ramifications of desegregation need to be considered in finance reform and policy formation. Also emphasized is the importance of communication among school boards, State and Federal legislatures, and individual school officials in the development of financial policies related to school desegregation.

Definitions of disparity are said to include: (1) differences between individual judges; (2) differences between comparable defendants; (3) differences between categories of offenses; (4) differences between regions and circuits; and (5) differences between courts of various levels. Civil rights issues in sentencing which include racial, sex, or class discrimination are also discussed along with measures for reform. Suggested reforms include the limitation of judicial discretion, the use of sentencing guidelines, panels or reviews, presentencing services, and improved communication between judges and  correctional authorities. The report concludes that although the extent and causes of sentence disparity are unknown in many cases, it is certain that the United States Commission on Civil Rights has the authority and responsibility to take action with intent to resolve this issue.

First, a field study explored the attitudes of minority families participating in the city-suburban school desegregation program which involved city-suburban pupil transfers. Secondly, the pupil movement under the city and metropolitan desegregation plans was assessed for its impact on segregated residential housing patterns in the community. The third aspect of the study analyzed the two largest Federal rental housing programs operating in the county for their impact on racial integration of schools and housing. The study indicates a need for more coordinated efforts by school and housing officials if successful, long-range integration is to  occur. (Author/ML)",

A multivariate analysis is presented in section three. An analysis of white flight is presented in section four, and section five discusses findings and implications of the study. The report drew the following conclusions about desegregation success: (1) Federal coercion reduced racial isolation; (2) larger districts achieved less racial balance than smaller districts; (3)  southern districts had greater success than those outside the south; (4) countywide districts improved racial balance more than non-countywide districts; (5) support from school officials helped achieve desegregation; and (6) hiring new superintendents tended to improve prospects for desegregation success. Included in this report are five appendices: (1) the form for the case survey instrument; (2) a glossary of desegregation terms; (3) additional comments about survey reliability; (4) case profiles; and (5) selected school district characteristics.

The report provides background information on block grants and on the general implications of the Federal budget changes; presents data on past Federal education assistance to New York State and New York City; analyzes current authorization levels, proposed additional cuts and their projected impact; and examines the administrative portion of the budget of the New York State Education Department and the distribution of its services to school districts. It  concludes that the legislative changes, along with the reduction in total Federal funding, will have negative effects on the support, coordination, and delivery of public services, including public education, especially in New York City. Some recommendations are forwarded to ensure that the city continues to receive a fair share of Federal education funding. (Author/MJL)",

The latter is manifested in the way they pay attention to social cues, attach subjective meanings to words, show preference for social distance, and use nonverbal communication extensively. This particular thinking style affects cognitive development; observed differences in school success between black students and other groups may be attributed to black students' use of an information processing style which is not the preferred strategy in an educational setting. A stylistic approach to learning which would fit material to children's particular cognitive and affective  behaviors may have a positive effect on black school achievement. (Author/MJL)",

The guide is a tool which PICs can use to improve their capability to plan, manage, and evaluate the programs which they administer, and to establish locally defined business-oriented performance standards for TITLE VII programs. The guide contains five major sections. Section 1 discusses PIC PME in general and provides a self-assessment checklist which can be used to evaluate the present status of the PIC's PME approach, while section 2 provides a general orientation and introduction to the PME process. In section 3, the specific phases and steps in the process are detailed, and information  and techniques which can be employed in applying the steps are explained. Sections 4 and 5 contain aids and records to be used in implementing and documenting the PME process in PICs. In addition, a glossary contains the definitions of concepts and terms which are central to the PME process, and an appendix cites additional material which can be referred to in order to facilitate the development and refinement of the PIC's PME system. (This guide and the planning, management, and evaluation process which it presents are being field tested this fiscal year with ten PICs. Based upon that field test, the process and the guide will be revised, refined, and then packaged in final form for national dissemination.) (KC)",

Changes in a teacher's method of instruction should be made to meet needs of the students, but the teacher is also responsible for trying different teaching techniques in the classroom that increase his/her enjoyment of teaching. Some factors that influence a teachers' willingness to use new ideas are characteristics of the innovation that affect the adoption decision, basic stages of the adoption process, characteristics of the adopter that affect the adoption decison, and influence of superior-subordinate roles on the adoption decison. The process of acceptance of innovation includes teacher awareness, evaluation for possible use, trial,  evaluation of effectiveness, and adoption. Diffusion researchers have shown that if the adoption rate of an innovation is plotted over time, a bell-shaped curve results. Slow adoption rate by educators is attributed to lack of profit and teacher risk of failure. Personal attributes or characteristics that affect a person's willingness to change include age (younger people welcome change) and education (the greater the education the more likely the person is to be innovative).

        "description":"A project was conducted to develop and refine an adult basic education (ABE) teaching/learning management system called CUBE (Continuity and Unity in Basic Education). (The CUBE system--a diagnostic/prescriptive system for individualizing competency based learning for students in ABE--provides a flexible and complete system of instruction for ABE students in the content areas of reading, math, English, and vocabulary; instruction on the topic of learning disabilities and the adult learner; and a system for complete program management.) Objectives of the program were to refine the goals of the system and package the materials, to conduct five regional workshops on the system, and to implement the system in four local ABE programs. These objectives were completed successfully in  the following manner: (1) instructional materials in each of the four content areas were revised and organized into color-coded notebooks; (2) also developed were instructional and program administration manuals; (3) with the aid of project staff who made on-site visits, four local programs implemented the system; and (4) a series of regional meetings were conducted and resulted in additional requests for implementation of the system. (The project-developed materials and manuals are available separately--see note.) (MN)",

        "description":"The Appalachia Educational Laboratory (AEL) contracted with the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) to seek information on the presence, operation, and impact of adult learning programs within the 13-state Appalachian Region. Literacy was defined on a program operation base, possible programs were listed, and program descriptions were obtained thorugh a 50-item survey and selected site interviews. Data were collected and analyzed in six operational areas: program descriptions, placement/progress, instructional activities and teaching staff, program governance, administrative activities and staff, and general information. Some of the results are as follows: (1) most programs offer reading/mathematics and high school equivalency programs, mostly in public schools; (2) most of the  programs use standard tests for placement, while less than half use them to assess program completion; (3) students stay in the learning programs a considerably shorter time than students outside the region; (4) teachers and students are mostly involved in establishing learning and skill objectives; (5) few tutors are certified; (6) Steck-Vaughn, Cambridge Books, and New Readers Press are most often used for materials; (7) programs have a variety of budgets; (8) students are recruited through the media; (9) program evaluation is usually end-product rather than process oriented; and (10) most programs have 100 or fewer students and fewer than 10 teachers. Based on the survey, 15 recommendations were made concerning the definition of adult functional literacy, target audience,  effectiveness, theory, programming, and organizational development. (Appendixes, the entirety of volume 2, include site visit forms, directories, lists, and contacts; information data form; outside evaluations of the questionnaire; adult literacy program survey (ALPS) forms; data confirmation; address lists of ALPS; and address of negative and nonresponding potential programs).

Topics covered in the case studies include the circumstances leading to adoption of the program, details of compensation and administrative arrangements, and perceived and measured advantages and disadvantages of given programs. Following a discussion of such measures for temporarily reducing work hours as shortened workweeks, rotation layoff, and short-time compensation, seven case studies of various temporary work hour reduction programs are set forth. Examined next are 15 programs involving such practices to facilitate permanent reduction of work hours as  shorter workweeks, part time, and extended holidays and vacations. In an analysis of flexible worklife options, case studies are presented of 15 programs utilizing voluntary time-income trade-offs, leaves, and phased retirement. (MN)",

Literature was reviewed that concerned state evaluation of general, vocational, and bilingual vocational education. This information and information from interviews and correspondence on these areas were used to develop a questionnaire that identified the additional needs of BVPs as compared with traditional vocational education programs. The questionnaire was also designed to identify standards and criteria, which, when met, would indicate that effective bilingual/vocational education (BVE) and/or vocational education for the limited English proficiency students was being provided. New York City BVP instructors and administrators participated in the pilot test of the  Bilingual Vocational Instructional Program Review Component (BVIPRC) which contained those standards and criteria identified. Based on the Vocational Education Instructional Program Review, the BVIPRC includes a self evaluation component and on-site review. (A copy of the BVIPRC is provided.) The revised BVIPRC was field tested with BVE personnel in Florida. A total of 69 BVE staff participated in the study--35 completed the questionnaire and pilot tested the BVIPRC, 34 participated in BVIPRC field testing and evaluation.

A potentially successful mass literacy campaign has to be both an educational and a political event. A useful theory of the mass literacy campaign must, therefore, include the two dimensions of ideology and technology. Ideology will determine the possibility of the articulation and sustenance of the political will to achieve universal literacy--a necessary condition for a successful campaign. The prevailing ideology of the society will also determine the organizational and technological choices that can be made in the planning and  implementation of the campaign. The technology of the mass literacy campaign must deal with three sets of considerations: creating organizational structures; determining dissemination of information about the campaign as well as its curricular content, target audience, and methods and materials to be used; and motivation of the people through mobilization. A model for planning and implementation of a mass literacy campaign would include the following elements: mating of ideas of politicians, development theorists and literacy workers; articulation of the political will; sustenance of the political will; temporary institutionalization of the first policy initiative; development of a comprehensive policy-making and -legitimizing organ; study and diagnosis of pre-conditions; evaluation;  implementation of programs; and preparation and implementation of post-literacy programs.

In the second survey personal interviews were conducted with nine major employers in the community. (Survey results are presented in narrative form.) It was recommended  that information about adult basic education programs be made more available with special emphasis on reaching unskilled workers. Instruction should be directed toward preparation for the General Educational Development Tests, earning high school diplomas, and increasing job competency. Programs should provide consumer skills courses and a wide variety of courses in the academic, vocational, hobby, and leisure time activities areas.

Four conditions examined by the JDRP are considered: (1) the evidence must be valid and reliable, (2) the effect must be of sufficient magnitude and have educational importance, (3) it should be possible to reproduce both the intervention and its effects at other sites, and (4) project data must be believable and interpretable. Discussion of statistical significance are size effect, importance of the educational area,  and cost of the intervention. Considerations for replicability include setting, staff, participants, and components. Topics under the final condition of believability and interpretability include consistency of factual data in narrative and tables, completeness of data, and objectivity maintained in gathering data. An evaluation design checklist is appended. (YLB)",

They provide ideas for administrators of private and public adult education programs, business and industry executives, and all concerned with adult literacy. In &quot;Modern Adult Basic Education: An Overview&quot; by Curtis Ulmer the state of the art is reviewed. Following a survey of the history of United States literacy, the characteristics, attitudes, and needs of the illiterate are discussed, literacy is defined, literacy legislation and training are outlined, and effective programs are described. The paper concludes with implications for the 1980s. &quot;Critical Issues in Adult Literacy&quot; by Oliver  Patterson and Louis L. Pulling covers recruiting and retaining illiterate adults, goals of literacy programs, identifying target populations, minimizing failure, and mobilizing community resources. Adult education strategies are surveyed in &quot;Adult Basic Education Instructional Strategies: Their Design and Improvement&quot; by K. Owen McCullough. The paper describes roles and clientele characteristics, expounds adaptation of various learning theories to adult basic education, cites instructional techniques and materials, and predicts changes in adult education. &quot;The Care and Feeding of Instructors of Adult Literacy and Basic Education&quot; by Waynne B. James considers the need for quality instructors, instructor role, instructor competencies, instructor selection, and instructor  training/preparation. (YLB)",

In the first section the four steps in the process of obtaining such ideas and information are outlined. These are: (1) arranging the meeting of representatives of parents and community members, (2) orienting the participants (purpose of meeting, procedures, rules for brainstorming), (3) conducting the brainstorming session, and (4) summarizing, reporting, and implementing the results. The next section presents ideas selected from brainstorming sessions with hard-to-reach parents. These ideas are divided into the categories of parents with which they are intended for use:  disinterested/alienated, single, and limited English speaking. For each group of parents these types of ideas are presented: concerns relative to their children's school achievement, ways to improve communication with the parent, and ways the school can encourage the parent to work with his/her children on the basic skills.

Focus is on how community education contributes to the regular, ongoing K-12 curriculum. Administrator responses are directed to these five questions: (1) How do you see community education relating to the overall goals of your school district? (2) How can community education assist the teachers and students at the K-12 level? (3) How can community education assist not only with the K-12 instructional program, but also with other school functions such as communicating with parents and other patrons, obtaining information relative to student needs, and what the  community feels the school should be doing? (4) What are some benefits (values) of having the community involved in the school at the K-12 level? and (5) What are some examples of ways the community is involved at the K-12 level in your school district?

        "description":"The Redirected Homemakers Project began in August, 1979, as a program to aid displaced homemakers in the assessment and development of skills which could be translated into meaningful, salaried work. The project operated within the office of Community Education of the Austin (Texas) Independent School District. Within the structure of the school district, more than 400 women were served in a 12-month period through classes, counseling, job development, job placement, and referral services--all at no cost to the clients. This publication describes the Redirected Homemakers Project from idea through conception, proposal writing, program development and implementation, funding efforts, and evaluation, with emphasis on how the reader can use the experiences incurred in the Austin  project to implement a similar project of community education, regardless of the aim or client population of such a project. Following introductory comments about displaced homemakers and the Austin Redirected Homemakers Project, the guide is divided into seven chapters covering staffing, providing services for displaced homemakers, community education and redirected homemakers, start-up of the project, assessing needs, developing community support, and project evaluation. Throughout the chapters, \"On Your Own\" sections offer concrete suggestions to the reader on methods of putting into practice the experiences of the Austin project. Appendixes to the document include materials used to recruit clients into the program, client intake forms, sample programs, and a bibliography of sources  about displaced homemakers. (KC)",

As background information on Pike County, demographic data are provided, and the development of community education is overviewed. Development of the support base for the project is then considered. The needs assessment is discussed that established these needs: improvement of K-12 students' basic skills; improvement of K-12 discipline; improvement of human relation skills; and improvement of communication. Rationale and motivation for parental involvement in the schools are addressed. These steps in implementation in phase 1 that focused on parenting for elementary parents are covered:  funding, staffing, securing support, parent recruitment, teacher training, and parent training. Following an overview of the years between phases 1 and 2, the plan of operation for phase 2 when the program was expanded to include parents of K-12 students is overviewed.

Baseline data were collected from personnel as they performed each of the five phases of the ISD functions without the assistance of Job Aids. Job Aids were then provided to individuals who were engaged in each of the 19 major ISD activities. Data were collected relating to problems alleviated by using the Job Aid, problems encountered in using the Job Aid, and user acceptance of the Job Aid. All of the individuals given the Job Aids thought they were good or excellent. The  only negative comments were editorial in nature. A major shortcoming of the evaluation was the fact that the continuous nature of the ISD process was not accommodated. There is still the need to evaluate the utility and impact of the Job Aids when applied to the ISD process as a whole. It was recommended that Job Aids be used throughout the entire ISD process for a given course development effort.

Differences in program design that were found in the research literature are described before findings about effectiveness of C&amp;HE programs are reported. These findings are grouped according to their impact on learner's knowledge, learner's attitudes, student perceptions of usefulness of C&amp;HE courses, and impact on learner's behavior. Findings are reported that suggest that C&amp;HE programs are effective, although many of the studies cited tended not to be widely generalizable. The second part of this report discusses research design for better effectiveness  evaluation. Some alternatives to traditional experimental research designs are reviewed, including naturalistic inquiry, modus operandi, goal-free evaluation, regression discontinuity analysis, and goal attainment scaling. These other suggestions for sound research designs are discussed: avoidance of errors and limitations, establishment of test instrument/evaluation measure reliability and validity, and planning for replication. To illustrate appropriate and inappropriate methodology and assumptions, Mental Health, Head Start, and Employment and Training Programs evaluation research studies are summarized. Some research in progress is also described. A bibliography is appended. (YLB)",

Growth of the civilian labor force will be slower, the share of government employment will decline, a higher proportion of the gross national product will originate in manufacturing, and the labor force will consist increasingly of better educated persons in their prime working age. To adapt to the new conditions of the labor market, most of vocational education's present institutions will remain in place, but their functions will change. The stress in career education is likely to shift from entry job orientation to career ladders. Training programs will be used to instill positive work attitudes. Broadening of employment opportunities to  youth in secondary programs is likely. Most emphasis will probably be focused on service job training. Formal apprenticeship programs will not be expanded, although community- or school-sponsored programs may be established. Postsecondary vocational education may grow from (1) new federal programs to subsidize business, (2) requirement that businesses set aside funds to finance additional training of the labor force, and (3) an American economy rededicated to quality.

        "description":"In order to assess the performance of vocational education in Rochester, New York, it is first necessary to consider the city's major economic and demographic trends. On the one hand, Rochester is a center for highly technical industries that are expected to experience a very slow rate of growth. On the other hand, it is characterized by an increasingly disadvantaged minority group central-city population. It is precisely this central-city population from which most of the city's vocational education participants come. Only one vocational high school exists in the city, and interviews with school administrators indicate that the vocational education program in the regular secondary schools is rather limited and rudimentary in character. The city's adult level vocational education  program is assisted by the presence of several colleges and universities. In addition, a number of Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) programs provide adult vocational education opportunities. Analysis of the city's economic climate, demography, and existing vocational education programs reveals the following needs areas: improved counseling and recruitment efforts, increased concentration on postsecondary programs, more emphasis on generalizable skills, and efforts to improve the image of the city's vocational education program.

If the idea of vocational education as part of the public school system is going to work, it is necessary to make vocational education a collaborative effort among education, employer, and organized labor institutions. Also needed is a policy of recognition of the educational objectives of the vocational education approach, rather than the present fixed focus on immediate placement outcomes. Policymakers should move toward joint school-employer occupational instruction, with the burden of proof shifting to the states to justify a solely public classroom approach.  Rather than relying on government corrective actions to adjust curricula to changing labor needs, educators should build adjustments to changing technology and markets into the system. Also necessary are programs to facilitate the school to work transition, including job placement, job search education, and employment assistance as well as programs to facilitate occupational adjustments and help employers upgrade their labor force. Included among other national imperatives to be considered are meeting skill shortages, promoting entrepreneurship, and integrating federal human resource development efforts. (MN)",

        "description":"The 1976 Vocational Education Act set up procedures governing the flow of funds from the federal government to the states and from the states to the localities; and it establishes priorities for distribution of funds. The Act also demands that money be spent only on the programs or activites mentioned in the Act and that certain minimum proportions of federal grants are to be spent in providing training for the handicapped, the disadvantaged, and those with limited knowledge of English. This study was conducted to determine how well these mandates are being met. Data were collected from the Vocational Education Data System (VEDS) and from various state, local, and federal government reports. Findings included the following: (1) The formula specified by the Act for distributing  VEA funds to the states does not target funds effectively; it directs more funds to southern and western states with relatively low rates of unemployment. (2) There is no systematic relationship between the distribution of funds within states and factors specified by Congress for determining the distribution of funds. (3) Even when states satisfied the instructions to concentrate resources in school districts with particular characteristics, the degree to which they met these requirements varied greatly. (4) Funding for targeted populations rarely exceeded mandated minimum levels and sometimes did not meet minimums. In general, it was found that federal vocational education law is ambiguous and ineffectively administered; has ineffective matching requirements; requires excessive data  collection and reporting; and is inadequately coordinated with other federal education policies.

While the Act specifies that a formula must be used for distribution of funds, the exact criteria for determining the formula are not spelled out, and states, therefore, have established a variety of formulas, some of which are no more in tune with the Act's intent than a simple per-capita distribution would be. There are three basic steps in designing formulas for distributing funds: data selection, transformation of data into standardized scores, and transformation of standardized scores into dollar allocations or reimbursement rates. States  employed a variety of approaches to data collection and to transforming raw data into standardized scores, although they used one of three general methods for transforming standardized scores into dollar allocations or rates of reimbursement: a tabular method, a reimbursement rate equation, or a weighted points method. No state was using a procedure free of technical difficulties, arbitrary judgments, unexplained calculations, questionable interpretations of federal law, or inaccurate and inappropriate questionable interpretations of federal law, or inaccurate and inappropriate data. An alternative formula was proposed. (The final section of this report provides detailed descriptions of the fund distribution practices in each state--see note.) (KC)",

        "description":"A study focusing on vocational education in the Atlanta schools reveals that while vocational education in the Atlanta public schools has a long history, full-fledged job training was quite late in coming to Atlanta's high schools. With the onset of desegregation in the mid-1960s, several new projects were initiated to enhance vocational education on the elementary and secondary levels. However, statistics affirm that even today vocational education should be a stronger alternative for Atlanta's students than it is. Among the reasons for this state of affairs are the following: lack of uniform and adequate procedures for hiring and training teachers; lack of federal, state, and local agreement over the immediate purpose of vocational education in high schools, and segregation of  vocational programs in inner-city areas. In addition, female and black enrollment statistics and local administrator and teacher attitudes reinforce skepticism of the the state's commitment to sex and race equity. On-site visits to several Atlanta schools and interviews with school teachers and administrators support the notion that while vocational education programs get a fair share of Atlanta's educational budget, they do not get full support in terms of recognition and leadership.

        "description":"The history of the Chicago school system has been parallel to and intertwined with the city's political system, producing a school system which serves a diversity of interests through a multiplicity of programs, with varying levels of effectiveness. Vocational education, in particular, now is conducted in one superior trade school, several excellent vocational high schools, a hierarchy of lesser vocational high schools, and, less effectively, in the city's comprehensive neighborhood high schools. Recently, federal programs, such as the Vocational Education Act and Amendments and the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), have begun to have some influence on the vocational education program in Chicago. As a result, if the Chicago experience can be generalized, two  separate systems of vocational education have begun to emerge in the United States. On one side, vocational education is offered by the public schools; is financed through state and local funds; has slowly developed over decades in response to political pressures; and offers a range of instruction to a wide variety of social and ethnic groups. At its best, it provides high quality training to able students who find jobs; at its worst, it provides vocational orientation courses to borderline students who have little interest in education and little expectation of success in the job market. On the other side is a manpower training program provided through CETA, federally financed and closely tied to local political leaders. CETA programs provide second chances for the school's worst  populations, but have many organizational and staff problems. A link between the two systems is needed to more effectively serve the low-income, minority groups which neither system seems able to serve effectively, both in Chicago and elsewhere in the country.

        "description":"This report on the impact of the Vocational Education ACT (VEA) on special needs populations in vocational education examines the structure of the VEA, the state and local contexts in which the law is implemented, and the problems of serving special populations that the mechanisms are attempting to address. Outlined first are the goals and role of the VEA as they pertain to special needs populations. Various aspects of state behavior and implementation of the VEA are discussed, including funds administration, reporting on use of funds and on coordination with other laws, evaluating the results of additional services, other state agency activities, and policy implications. Covered next are the following aspects of local implementation of the VEA definition, identification and  placement of handicapped, disadvantaged, and limited English proficient students; strategies for serving each of these special needs populations; planning and reporting activities; and policy implications. Reasons behind the limited impact of the VEA are discussed, including the multiple goals and administrating agencies of the VEA, differences between state and local contexts in which the law is implemented, and problems in serving special needs populations. Also included in the report are recommendations pertaining to possible structural changes in the VEA. (MN)",

Presented first are brief descriptions of and detailed 1967-1980 enrollment figures for the four training programs administered by the VA (G I Bill, the program for survivors and dependents of veterans, vocational rehabilitation, and the Post-Vietnam era Veterans Educational Assistance Program). Major differences among the three versions of the G I Bill are outlined. Examined next are the following major changes in the VA program structure that make it impossible to fully ascertain the extent of VA support of occupational  education: (1) the existence of different enrollment and attendance requirements for college and vocational school students, (2) trends in classifying community colleges into the categories of higher learning or below college level institutions, and (3) the incompleteness of the data base for occupational education. Finally, descriptions are provided of the major available sources of data pertaining to VA administration of occupational education. (MN)",

The case study method was used to collect data in 15 communities concerning the academically disadvantaged, the handicapped, the limited-English proficient, women, and Indians. Among the general findings are the following. (1) Local policy concerns are related to equity and quality of educational opportunities and greatest concern was with academic skills and proficiency requirements for graduation. (2) Definitions of special needs populations eligible for vocational education programs are the sole basis for defining their needs. (3) The planning process in general is of a  short-term nature and lacks the coordination often evident at the community college level. (4) Planning activities at almost every location focuses exclusively on the academically disadvantaged and the handicapped. (5) Strategies used by local educational agencies are provided through their established student support system. (6) Rarely are there attempts to systematically assess the effects of various strategies and programs. (A more complete list of findings and descriptions are included.

        "description":"Vocational guidance and counseling is supported by the United States government through a variety of laws. The Vocational Education Act (VEA) and other federal legislation consistently provide funds for services to assist in the transition from education/training to work, from unemployment to employment, or from one career to another. Most legislation portrays vocational guidance as an ancillary service. Multiple funding and legislative mandates have made coordination of federal programs and funding sources for vocational guidance difficult. Responsibility for such coordination efforts has been delegated to the local level, where inconsistent terminology that is interpreted differently by administrators and practitioners and other responsibilities of local school guidance  personnel act as barriers to administrative efficiency and coordination. Proposed changes to the VEA's guidance provisions would make guidance part of the core programs by funding it out of the basic federal program grant and ensuring inclusion of guidance programs and personnel in all aspects of the ACT's program. A unique role exists for the federal government in the collection, delivery, and utilization of occupational information through the activities of the Employment Service, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bureau of the Census, and the National and State Occupational Information Coordinating Committees.

The sample included the total population of Directors of Vocational Education for the United States and its territories; 50 directors completed the questionnaire. All respondents indicated they had either fully implemented or were in the process of implementing the mandated evaluation activities. Program improvement was the primary reason for adopting current evaluation practices. Employer feedback and placement of former students were identified as the most often identified indicators of program quality. Student followup and employer assessment of former students were the most fully implemented evaluation  activities. Assessment of student performance and of special needs services remained the least implemented activities. Respondents were generally satisfied with their state's system for evaluating vocational programs. They also indicated a high level of usefulness of evaluation activities. Specific purposes for which they were used were making improvements, preparing accountability reports, and aiding decision making. Recommendations for further development of federal policy were emphasizing evaluation's improvement function and keeping requirements for evaluation procedures consistent.

        "description":"Review of the methods for estimating future employment opportunities shows that there is an ongoing system, involving the Department of Labor and state employment agencies, for making projections for the United States as a whole and for states and major metropolitan areas. This system combines national research on economic growth, technological developments, and the structure of the economy with local information on industry trends and the labor market situation. Weak spots in the methods occur in making projections of the occupational composition of industries, and in accounting for mobility among occupations and patterns of withdrawal from, and return to, the labor force in individual occupations. Current research on economic growth, technological developments, and the  occupational composition of industries may lead to improvements in the reliability of projections. Past projections have been moderately successful in identifying the expanding and declining industries and occupations, and in estimating rates of growth in expanding fields. However, in projecting the other major component of job openings, replacement of those who leave each occupation, the estimates have not been as accurate. Only estimates of deaths and net labor force withdrawals, calculated from averages, are available, and movement among occupations is not accounted for. Comparison of the job openings estimates with data on the numbers of people being trained for each occupation is essential in arriving at judgments about employment opportunities, and in adapting enrollments to  prospective demand. However, problems with gathering statistics from the uncentralized vocational education establishment must be worked out for the two systems to work together to match employment demand and trained worker supply.

        "description":"In order to determine how vocational education programs should be evaluated, it is first necessary to define vocational education, to describe how vocational education programs are now being evaluated, to find out how other federal education programs are evaluated, and to suggest what criteria might reasonably be set out in future federal legislation for the evaluation of vocational education. Vocational education can be defined as encompassing some 28,000 institutions providing three types of occupational preparation, in nine general types of program areas, at four educational levels, to meet the needs of at least seven special needs groups. Studies by several researcher and Congressional hearings have demonstrated that vocational education is being evaluated on a variety of  criteria, with a confusing mix of data. Federal regulations, however, call for each state vocational education program to be evaluated once every five years in terms of planning and operational processes, student achievement, student employment success, and results of additional services provided to special populations. Title I (Education of Disadvantaged Children) and Public Law 94-142 (Education of the Handicapped) have somewhat different evaluation requirements than the Vocational Education Amendments set forth, raising questions of whether evaluation should be seen as a management and accounting activity for the federal government, or as a diagnostic and planning tool for local schools and districts. It is suggested that the federal role in vocational education evaluation requirements  be lessened, inasmuch as the federal government provides less than 10 percent of its support. It is also proposed that evaluation criteria be developed pertaining to program improvement and that evaluation of labor market demands be left to the federal government. (KC)",

The SFUSP is hampered by the city's pluralistic and decentralized governance approach. Although the state was not irrelevant in establishment of local education policy, vocational education program development primarily bears the imprint of internal political, social, and economic factors. The future of secondary vocational education is not encouraging, considering the increasingly dominant role of comparatively well-financed community colleges. In apparent contrast to the contractive process in the SFUSD is the recently developed School of Business and  Commerce. It was designed, however, primarily as a last-ditch measure to gather and maintain SFUSD's outstanding vocational education resources. SFUSD's present program limitations and future financial constraints have enabled SFCCD to dominate vocational instruction through its dual delivery systems: the main community college campus and decentralized college centers and satellites. Vocational Education Act funding is largely a supplement for the two local delivery systems. It also carries the adverse impact of distracting local administrators from their primary responsibililties. While providing supplemental vocational training, Comprehensive Employment and Training Act programs are weakened by vast resource scattering. (YLB)",

These factors include demography, availability of staff, costs of vocational education, and available funds. Section 3 describes a vocational teacher supply/demand (VTSD) model, a system dynamics model which is explicitly casual but the structure of which is guided but not determined by historically observed relationships. (The model produces data paralleling historical trends in  vocational education, but it allows the reader to understand the assumptions which produce the trend data.) These incomplete and tentative conclusions are summarized from the model output from the initial base run of the VTSD model: gradual end by the mid 1980s of rising numbers of secondary vocational enrollment, gradual decline in growth at the postsecondary level, and no serious shortages of vocational instructors into the next decade.

The case study cities were Atlanta, Chicago, Rochester, and San Francisco. It was found that vocational education must provide students with skills and contacts to successfully manage the transition. Informal contacts were particularly important for negatively stereotyped groups, specifically young adults. Ways of managing the transition were varied among postsecondary, secondary, and Comprehensive Employment and Training Act programs in urban areas. Congressional efforts to regulate program direction as mandated in the Vocational Education  Amendments have had little effect. Federal funds were being used largely to maintain existing programs and equipment. Procedural compliance with federal planning provisions was occurring. Program evaluation relied on traditional approaches with school officials in control. Local response to sex fairness provisions was quite limited. Local advisory councils have involved the private sector. It was recommended that through modification of federal vocational education policy Congress (1) emphasize contacts with the marketplace, (2) eliminate systems of institutional stratification, (3) encourage cooperation between programs and institutions, and (4) introduce greater variety.

The entrepreneurship project overview discusses the background and purpose of the project, how the modules are organized, what makes these materials unique, module format, and purpose of the handbook. The section on training components examines the module development process, module titles and elements, module content summaries, and purpose and use of the resource guide. Advantages of these components to the administrator, instructor, and student are explored in the third section. Administrative considerations such as need, compatibility, key support, initial planning, and program implementation are examined in the fourth section. Section 5 lists instructor considerations and  recommendations. These include instructional strategies, options for use of the modules, recommended planning, and daily management of the program. And finally, in the last section, evaluation of the implementation is discussed, including instructional evaluation and student outcome information. A list of references concludes the handbook.

Designed to accompany the 36 instructional modules, this resource guide lists all entrepreneurship materials identified during the literature review phase of the project. The guide includes both materials that were used specifically in writing modules and those that provided general background information. This guide is divided into five sections. The introduction explains the purpose of the literature review, describes search procedures and the review process, and describes the organization of the resource guide. The annotated references section includes abstracts of individual general  entrepreneurship materials and describes small business series--large collections of pamphlets or manuals developed by entrepreneurship-oriented organizations. The additional references section gives citations for general entrepreneurship (followed by a brief phrase giving the type of material and target population) and entrepreneurship applied to specific businesses (followed by the names of the specific businesses discussed). The institutions section lists mailing addresses for organizations involved in entrepreneurship. The index to business-specific reference lists specific businesses for which existing entrepreneurship materials have been identified. (CT)",

Remedial communication and mathematics classes were also included in the program's design. In the first year 21 ninth grade students 14 years of age and two years behind grade were selected. To determine knowledge of and attitude about the program, surveys were conducted of students in the OPT program, their parents, and teachers of vocational education and remedial reading and mathematics. Results indicated students and parents were knowledgeable about and pleased with the program. Teacher comments were also positive. The California Achievement Test (CAT) was administered as a pretest/posttest to all Mitchell County High  School students. On the pretest regular students (highest scores) performed higher than non OPT (qualified but not selected for OPT), OPT, and vocational education students. Score analysis indicated that regular students scored highest on pretest/posttests; vocational education students scored next highest; non OPT students scored third highest; and OPT students were low scorers. Improvements were noted in reading scores across all groups. Increases were greatest for OPT students. Mathematics scores improved for some groups but decreased for OPT students.

        "description":"A review focused on impact of the 1978 Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) amendments in improving sponsor's employability development systems and transition performance. Fifteen prime sponsors in 10 states were visited. Files of 1135 participants were reviewed; 478 were interviewed. Sponsor and Employment and Training Administration officials were also interviewed. Prime sponsors were found to have difficulty moving participants into unsubsidized employment. Problems include not providing needed supportive services, entry-level job skills, or remedial skills and not placing participants in activities related to their occupational goal or not addressing their physical or mental handicaps. Prime sponsors had not fully implemented their employability development  systems. Their employability plans lacked basic information about the applicant, omitted planned CETA activities, or did not address transition. They often failed to follow plans or to review and revise them. Little emphasis was given to improving employability development systems. Low priority was given to preparing employability plans and to employability development. Recommendations called for stressing effective employability development systems, training sponsor's staff in employability development systems, and improving technical assistance and monitoring. (Appendixes include review methodology, position paper on management systems for employability development, and an initial and revised plan.) (YLB)",

General information may be used for all older adults, but two age categories (age 45-64 and age 65 and older) are distinguished in instances seemingly critical to understanding the information presented. Section 1 looks at the need for educational service for older learners and the Texas response. Conditions are discussed in section 2 that must be met to successfully recruit and retain older adults. These are resolving philosophical issues, especially director and staff commitment; preparing staff members to work with older learners; understanding the nature of recruitment; and making  concessions. Section 3 focuses on two recruitment strategies for older adults--television (news, talk shows and local programs, public service announcements) and linkages with other agencies and business organizations. Other methods various programs have used are listed under these general areas: mass media, specialized media brochures and fliers, posters, exhibits, individual/personal contact, agency/organization contacts, groups to contact, and innovative or unusual methods. Lists of resource organizations specific to Texas are appended. (YLB)",

        "description":"This document is a guide for use by the practical researcher concerned with conducting studies of transfer of learning from pretraining of pilots in ground-based environments to performance in aircraft. While the material addresses principally transfer of learning of pilots, many of the issues should be applicable to other contexts, to include training of other aircrew members or even individuals who have quite different tasks to perform. The paper does not deal with theory but, rather, is concerned entirely with method of the transfer study. Method issues, including the planning, task, students, performance measurement, instructors, and analyses, are central to arriving at precise estimates of transfer effects--approaching as closely as possible the maximum that might have been  demonstrated, providing a goal for the operational instructor pilot. Study models discussed include those for percent transfer of learning and for the transfer effectiveness ratio. Use of the latter should be essential in providing answers to contemporary questions concerning how much simulator pretraining can be used to replace aircraft training time--without reducing the production of the combat effective pilot. The guide was developed through review of published and unpublished studies of transfer of training from ground-based simulator to actual plane flying done during the past twenty or more years. Eleven steps were identified and are sequenced in the guide for use by researchers. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"An objective procedure was developed and tested to determine the relative difficulty of Air Force jobs. Also investigated were (1) the measurement of task difficulty to allow comparability across specialties, (2) the quantitative appraisal of job demands based on component tasks being performed, and (3) the comparability of job difficulty to job aptitude requirement. The study was based on task-level specifications of learning difficulty provided by two sources: supervisors and benchmark ratings developed by contract job analysts. These data were used to weight the relative difficulty of each task when computing aggregate estimates of learning difficulty for each enlisted specialty. The Comprehensive Occupational Data Analysis Programs (CODAP) package was used for the analysis of  task level data. Interrater reliability and correlation techniques were used to assess the agreement among supervisors and job analysis in the ratings of task difficulty. Regression equations were used to calibrate relative ratings on the benchmark scale. The calibrated ratings then were combined with average time-spent data to determine the relative difficulty of individual jobs and specialty groups. Both supervisory ratings and the contract job analyst ratings proved to be highly reliable, and the benchmark scales provided a highly reliable means of obtaining task difficulty ratings that were comparable across specialities. The methodology developed and implemented can be applied objectively to evaluate the relative aptitude requirements of Air Force jobs and to order jobs relative to  each other based on the level of talent required. It was recommended that this method be used in operational realignment of current aptitude requirements. (KC)",

        "description":"The evidence for the Terzuolo and Viviani central control model of timing in typing was questioned, using data collected from skilled typists and data published by Terzuolo and Viviani. (In this model keystroke times are generated in parallel from centrally stored, word-specific timing patterns. Differences in overall time to type a given word are attributed to multiplicative rate parameter, constant for a given typing of the word, but varying from one typing to another.) The three major lines of evidence cited in the model were researched: keystroke times expand or contract proportionally when words are typed slower or faster, the variances of keystroke times do not increase for successive letters in a word; and the times to type a given digraph exhibit work-specific  differences. Investigation methods included two studies involving professional typists who transcribed normal prose and simulation of keystroke times. Analysis showed that keystroke times do not expand proportionally, the apparent constancy of variance is an artifact of the method that Terzuolo and Viviani used to transform the keystroke times, and effects of surrounding character context are sufficient to explain differences in digraph latencies and these effects cross work boundaries, showing they are not word-specific.

Data were gathered through literature reviews; perusal of reports from the Adult and Community Education Branch of the Maryland State Department of Education; and interviews with and survey questionnaires filled out by local ABE program coordinators, teachers, counselors, and students. It was found that some of the ABE programs in Maryland are providing some counseling  services in varying degrees; however, no program is providing all needed services and some programs provide few or none. Based on the findings, it was recommended that local ABE programs begin to build a program of counseling services that would address the needs of students as they enter, participate in, and leave the program. The recommendations include minimal standards for delivery of these services. Services should include (1) entry services introduction to the program, registration and orientation, initial assessment of skills, academic program planning, self-appraisal, goal setting, and establishment of group support systems; (2) participation and retention services monitoring student progress, academic planning, career development and planning, assistance with personal concerns,  and maintenance of group support systems; and (3) exit services reaching dropouts, follow up of completers, referral to appropriate community agencies, and staff development. A model comprising a three-year plan of goals for counseling services in Maryland ABE programs was proposed. (KC)",

        "description":"A three-year project was conducted in Pennsylvania to design and implement a comprehensive model evaluation management information and policy support unit within the state vocational rehabilitation (VR) agency. Five mandated project tasks were carried out to produce products that are necessary for program evaluation (PE). Proposed Federal Evaluation Standards were field tested; the functions of the PE section were conceptualized; techniques and methods of PE were developed and personnel were trained for PE; utilization techniques were developed and improved; and various resources were used to assist in qualitative review. At the completion of the three-year contract, 10 products were produced for use by a model VR PE unit. These products include case review studies, an annual  plan for case reviews, client follow-up studies, a computerized system and procedures for identifying and reporting dollars saved through use of non-BVR resources, a technical assistance center, a profile analysis technique to be used as a management tool, a data base system, a program evaulation section organization handbook, a management information system, and guidelines for development of program evaluation plans. Evaluation of the project led to recommendations for refinements and recognition of the difficulty of the evaluation task. (The report is a narrative on ongoing activities, rather than a conceptual review of the project.) (KC)",

It was based on a secondary analysis of data collected in the Army Life-78 Study, which considered relationships of organizational climate and unit effectiveness. Subjects were 8,140 personnel assigned to 60 battalions. Other administrative data considered were Unit Readiness Reports, Annual General Inspection Ratings, incidence of criminal activities, and measures of attrition. The most striking finding was that three types of satisfaction (job satisfaction, sense of equity from the Army, and overall satisfaction with the Army) were extremely closely related to variables of organizational climate and  also very highly associated with several job characteristics. To a lesser, but still significant extent, satisfaction was a function of several types of endogenous Army life problems (salary, time off, etc.). Considerations of the potentially moderating variables of soldier coping resources and presence of spouse with the servicemember contributed little to an understanding of the relationship of predictors to satisfaction. Unit attrition rates were not found to be related to measures of unit effectiveness. Recommendations were made for methodological changes in future research. (YLB)",

The field test design featured multiple replications at sites across the country. Participating students were enrolled in various types of secondary vocational schools and programs and experienced various instructional arrangements and methods of teaching. The field test was conducted under a variety of conditions. Several criteria were used in selecting sites at which to field test the modules. These criteria included (l) the site's interest in implementing the entrepreneurship modules; (2) sufficient enrollment so that a number of business-specific modules could be tested at each site; (3) willingness to meet evaluation design  specifications; and (4) geographical location. The modules were used in both regular vocational instruction and in cooperative education classes. Both treatment and control groups had approximately equal proportions of males and females. At all sites, the modules were taught by regularly employed vocational instructors, and modules were taught as part of the regular classwork. A test with 30 multiple-choice items was used in the field test. Modules were found to be low in cost and teachers found them to be generally valuable and easy to use. (CT)",

To evaluate a structured treatment method for child abusing parents, two treatment methods were studied. A new method, which focused on the parent's handling of hostility, was compared to the usual child welfare agency services before and after nine months of treatment. Outcome was assessed in terms of the parent's ability to handle hostility and the child's behavioral adjustment. Results indicated that parents receiving the new treatment improved significantly more, but their children were not as well adjusted at post-treatment as the agency services group's children. The findings suggest that abused children need  special attention in addition to whatever treatment is provided to their parents. (Author/JAC)",

        "description":"Recent work in attribution theory has shown the importance of not only the distinction between beliefs in internal and external causes, but also between relatively fixed, stable causes and those more unstable and subject to change. The relationships of causal attributions for success and failure in achievement and social affiliation with perceptions of temporal continuity of past, present, and future and with optimistic expectations for future events were explored with a sample of 215 high school students. All subjects completed the Long-Term Personal Direction subscale of the Temporal Experience Questionnaire to measure temporal continuity, the Achievability of Future Goals subscale of the Future Time Perspective Inventory to measure optimism, the Hopelessness Scale to  operationally define optimistic/pessimistic future expectations, and the Multidimensional-Multiattributional Causality Scale to measure causal attributions of ability, effort, task difficulty, and luck for both success and failure in achievement and social affiliation. Findings supported the hypothesis that more temporally oriented and optimistic adolescents were more likely to take personal responsibility for both achievement and affiliation successes and failures. The importance of the distinction between the internal attributions of effort and ability was also supported for achievement, as less optimistic and temporally oriented students were more likely to attribute failure to lack of ability, rather than to lack of effort. This finding suggests a consistency with the attributional  pattern associated with learned helplessness. (Author/NRB)",

The lifestyles of elderly Los Angeles residents (N=308), i.e., institutionalized, socially active in the community, or socially inactive in the community, were taken into account and examined in terms of individual perception of age. Subjects who identified themselves as feeling younger, older, or the same as their chronological age completed a battery of several psychological and sociodemographic measures. Findings indicated that the elderly who felt younger demonstrated greater affiliation tendencies, had subjectively more meaningful experiences, and felt more in control of their lives than those who  perceived themselves as older. When the covariates of health, income, psychological health, and interviewer's effects were removed, analysis of covariance revealed that the relationship between perceived age and locus of control disappeared. A person's sense of involvement and personal meaning emerged as the most influential predictors with respect to how old a person felt inside. The results suggest a direct relationship exists between one's concept of self as young or old. (Author/NRB)",

The purposes of these papers and the conference at which they were discussed were to identify issues to facilitate wise public decision-making about mental health care, to assess the current state of knowledge, and to suggest directions for economic research. The five papers consider difficulties caused by the lack of adequate understanding of what constitutes mental \"health,\" and the lack of consensus about the effectiveness of various forms of therapy. The first paper analyzes the benefits and costs of alternative mental illness therapies. The next paper explores the extent to which insurance stimulates demand and considers the potential long-term effects of widespread  insurance coverage on demand for mental health services. Two subsequent papers highlight the need for improved understanding of the nature of the varied resources employed in the mental health care industry. The growing political and professional pressures for deinstitutionalization and the problems of substituting community-based therapies are the focal point of the final paper. (NRB)",

        "description":"An increase in reciprocity of interpersonal attraction during the early acquaintance period followed by continuing social reciprocity are propositions that are central principles of several social psychological viewpoints. However, there is little empirical evidence of increasing reciprocity of interpersonal attraction over time. Two potential reasons exist for this failure to find reciprocity over time. First, the reciprocity correlation contains a mixture of two correlations: reciprocity at the individual level, and reciprocity at the dyadic level. Second, physical proximity may affect reciprocity, particularly during early acquaintance. The two reciprocity correlations and effects of physical proximity can be estimated from a round robin design. Data from six eight-person  clusters studied by Curry and Emerson were analyzed. Correlations computed by taking all possible dyads measured at five time points showed weak reciprocity effects with a decrease across the five time points. The individual level correlations were small, while the dyadic correlations were positive. Partialling out roommate effects from the dyadic correlation enhanced increasing reciprocity over time. Thus, the findings suggest that reciprocity of attraction increases over time when the research accounts for two different levels of analysis and controls for roommate effects. (Author/NRB)",

The issues, although discussed in this context, are considered to have implications for any consultant to a group which operates from a strong ideological basis. Eight characteristics of feminist organizations that are relevant to consultation are enumerated and discussed: (1) the organizations commitment to ideology may make entry difficult; (2) goals tend to be vague and grandiose and resources small; (3) emphasis focuses on egalitarian leadership and opposition to hierarchical structure; (4) the organization is attentive to interpersonal processes and accepting of emotional expression; (5) a sense of support/community is a major factor in joining the  organization; (6) commitment for principles, not money, is the cause for involvement; (7) deviation from principles may be heretical and reaction toward deviants may be highly charged; and (8) ambivalence about relating to outside institutions exists.

To study this observation, 21 graduate students were evaluated by male and female supervisors. Input process and outcome variables were analyzed. The data showed that young women psychologists worked mainly with same sex consultees of relatively low status in the organization. Males were more likely to be involved with administrative staff, who were often males. Male trainees tended to stay more actively involved with their cases. In open-ended questions, females received more comments about their appearance; women were also apparently given a narrower range of appropriate behavior in terms of aggressiveness. The findings indicate that  teaching may not be enough to create changes in this observed phenomenon. (JAC)",

To investigate this hypothesis an earlier experiment was replicated in three studies. Subjects received congruent or neutral information about a target person with one exception which was either congruent or incongruent with the impression and was attributed to either a situational or dispositional cause. Results demonstrated that incongruent behavior had an advantage in recall only when behavior was attributed to dispositional causes. When behavior was attributed to situational causes, incongruent information was no more likely to be recalled than congruent information. In  addition, subjects preferred situational attributions for incongruent behavior and dispositional attributions for congruent behavior. The findings suggest that when confronted with behavior that does not fit their stereotypes, individuals may search for a situational attribution, thereby decreasing the likelihood of recall. (JAC)",

Research has described the person sensitive to the public aspects of behavior to be in a state of public self-awareness. This construct of public self-consciousness was examined in relation to the individual's self-presentations to several different audiences. A median split of the Public Self-Consciousness subscale divided female undergraduates into high (N=50) and low (N=48) public groups. All subjects completed a self-concept measure, rating themselves on 20 bipolar adjectives representing general personality factors, and then used the same 20 adjective items to describe their actions in the presence of 5 persons (mother, best female friend, best male friend, a disliked person, and a professor).  Results showed that high public subjects were more variable than low public subjects in their self-reported behaviors across the different audiences and showed greater discrepancy between their general self-image and specific self-presentations. The findings support the validity of the public self-consciousness construct. (NRB)",

Subjects (N=97) ranging in age from 13 to late middle age completed a linguistic task in which they could impose higher order conceptions on lower order descriptions by identifying different level similarities within sets of three situations. Results demonstrated the usefulness of a hierarchical system of organizational levels for investigating the development of social knowledge. Subjects were less successful overall in finding higher level similarities, and showed a preference for the level of action. The developmental differentiation of conceptual abilities seems to enable a progressive competence at conceptualizing in terms of additional higher  levels of organization, as older and better educated subjects show increasing facility in operating across higher levels.

Subjects (N=53) listened to tape-recorded versions of two narrative passages and attempted to orally recall the stories. Subjects were compared on their abilities to comprehend prose and to differentiate the idea units of a passage in terms of their relative importance to the main theme. Results demonstrated that younger adults remembered more than older adults, but subjects from all age groups favored the main ideas in their recall. Subjects from all ages and educational levels were equally able to identify the important information in the stories.

To derive a prototype of a lonely person, 40 students were asked to describe a lonely person whom they knew. All descriptions were studied by judges who formed a final listing and frequency of all identified features. The 18 features which formed the prototype fell into three categories: feelings of isolation, actions resulting in isolation, and paranoid feelings. The UCLA Loneliness Scale was administered to college students who were then identified as lonely or non-lonely. Previous research on interpersonal problems reported by persons seeking psychotherapy provided a list of problems which subjects card-sorted as familiar or unfamiliar problems. The socializing cluster of problems differentiated  between lonely and non-lonely persons. The lonely person prototype also indicated that lonely persons lacked the social skills necessary for making friends. Questionnaire responses of lonely and non-lonely subjects revealed that lonely subjects explained interpersonal failure by a lack of ability. Lonely subjects also scored poorly on a test of interpersonal competence. The findings suggest that lonely persons' self-evaluations of their poor social skills are accurate. (Author/NRB)",

Changes in undergraduates' attitudes toward various delinquency interventions were examined as a result of participation in a psychology field experience aimed at diverting delinquent youth from the juvenile justice system. Training for the field experience consisted of formal course enrollment in which the techniques of behavioral contracting and child advocacy were taught. The field experience consisted of undergraduates working 6 to 8 hours a week for 18 weeks with a delinquent youth. Participating undergraduates (N=16) completed the Delinquency Orientation Scale  (DOS) before and after their field experience. A nonparticipant control group (N=36) also completed the DOS at similar times. The DOS was used to measure undergraduates' attitudes towards four types of social intervention applicable to delinquent youth: a punitive orientation, an individual treatment orientation, general social reform, and radical non-interventions. Results indicated that field experience participants' endorsements of individual treatment orientations significantly decreased more than nonparticipating students over time. The findings suggest that an extensive field experience can be an effective teaching strategy. (Author/NRB)",

Career types were identified and compared across job characteristics, reactions to the job, commitment to the job and withdrawal behaviors. Results indicated that there was general homogeneity across all domains. However, differences were found indicating that those with direct service experience and advanced degrees engaged in more general management activities. Withdrawal behaviors indicated that multiple direct service positions individuals were more affected by role ambiguity, conflict and  overload.

        "description":"Noting that one reason for the discrepant results found in research on reading difficulties is the variety of approaches used to assess reading and spelling problems, this paper examines two of these approaches in terms of their implicit assumptions and inherent failings. The paper first discusses the etiological approach, which tries to identify physical, environmental, and emotional factors that impede the reading or spelling process. The paper points out three difficulties with this approach: (1) a lack of criteria for differential diagnosis and the problem of overlap, (2) uncertainty of the direct causal relationship, and (3) the low and indirect therapeutic value of the approach. The paper next discusses the cognitive defect approach, which tries to isolate various types of  reading problems. Among the shortcomings listed for this approach are the inadequacy of the assumptions about the process of reading underlying it and its implicit assumption that the cognitive functions are a unitary process. The paper concludes that a more fruitful attempt to identify variables in reading difficulties is the process-oriented approach, which tries to identify partial processes of reading in which children with reading problems are deficient and cites a number of studies that support the value of this approach.

In examining the publisher's role in facilitating literacy, this booklet distinguishes between responsiveness to the express desires of schools and responsibility for the welfare and development of learners, arguing that publishers of educational materials fail to fulfil their responsibility in meeting the challenge of literacy, largely because they assess their performance by the reactions of teachers--whose inordinate dependency upon published materials obscures their judgment. After defining responsibility and the new challenge of literacy, the paper cites research to establish, first, the extent to  which teachers depend upon published materials, and second, the discrepancy between their evaluation of materials and those elicited from learners. Arguing that the latter are in the best position to indicate the educational value of materials, it proposes that publishers have a responsibility to educate purchasers, to field test their formulas and the materials to implement them, and to collaborate on their experiences. The paper concludes by recommending modifications in a proposal that the publishing industry establish a university research center, including an extension of the center's functions. (HTH)",

Nineteen students from a philosophy  class and 37 students from a history class elected to take a one-hour ten-week minicourse in critical reading in which the guides were used. The students completed evaluation forms on the materials after they had acquired experience using each type.

A short story, which was written at first grade and third grade readability levels, was divided into five sections at points in the story where predictions about forthcoming events could be made and used as stimuli. Immediately following the silent reading of each of the five sections of  the story, the subjects responded to a prediction question. The recorded responses were scored for reference to explicit facts, prediction statements, and accuracy of prediction. The results supported the hypothesis that induced mental imagery enhances the ability to infer and make text predictions for third grade students, but not for the younger subjects. (HTH)",

Both the 25 teachers in the experimental program and the teachers not involved in the project completed measures of teachers' attitudes toward teaching content area reading and of attitudes toward the inservice program. The results showed that the teachers involved in the workshops gained significantly in their attitudes toward content area reading, while the comparison group remained essentially similar on both administrations  of the attitude survey. The conclusions drawn from the study were (1) that longterm involvement in inservice training in content area reading improves both knowledge of reading skills and attitudes toward content area reading, and (2) that the role of the reading supervisor was particularly critical to the inservice programs, because the supervisor served as the main link between the monthly theory workshops and the monthly application workshops.

Whereas the intentions of the testing are good, the way these tests are interpreted sometimes results in placing students who do not have basic writing problems in basic writing classes. Perhaps the clearest way to identify basic writing students and their errors is to begin by examining the kinds of writing problems and skills that introductory composition teachers should accept as theirs to confront, such as compositional weaknesses, syntax and diction problems, or spelling  errors. The students who can be helped by the basic writing class are those who cannot conform to the grammatical and mechanical conventions of standard English, who do not recognize sentence boundaries, or whose vocabulary is so limited and whose vocabulary skills are so weak that they cannot communicate an idea. Educators responsible for writing programs should both examine the differences in ability between the strongest and the weakest beginning writing students at their own institutions and use these differences to determine the criteria that indicate what is taught in a basic writing course and what is taught in composition classes.

        "description":"There are four conditions essential to developing and maintaining sound English curricula in the secondary schools. The first condition is that society hold public school education in sufficient respect that education can attract teaching candidates who are emotionally mature and committed to high intellectual and technical standards. More than just high salaries, this means a high public regard for the purpose and judgment of the profession. The second condition is a long overdue alteration of the prevailing model of public school education, a model that was derived from industry at the turn of the century and one that is increasingly obsolete in a society far more reliant on information processing than on the linear production of goods. The third condition is that teachers must  have adequate instructional materials. This includes many books and magazines (censorship not withstanding), audio and visual equipment, and computer terminals. And the fourth condition is that the skills and content of English must logically cohere and be intelligently related to the processes of speaking, writing, reading, listening, and viewing. Literature and rhetoric must be intrinsically related to each other and to their overriding and generative source, language. (HTH)",

The second section of the paper cites research into audience responses to sexist language, noting the harmful effects of a masculine bias in language and how this bias alienates and offends women.

        "description":"Twenty 10th grade students participated in a study designed to identify differences in the ways developing writers use words to create written texts. Essays written by the students were holistically evaluated and then analyzed for the types and the number of lexical cohesive ties used and the nature of the grammatical subject, or focus, of each clause. The analysis of lexical cohesion in the 9 high-rated and 11 low-rated essays showed large differences. In the low-rated essays, the total number of lexical ties constituted 15% of the total number of words, while the total number of words entering into lexical ties constituted 25% of the total number of words. In the high-rated essays, the total number of lexical ties constituted 21% of the total number of words, while the total  number of words entering into lexical ties constituted 44% of the total number of words. The analysis of the grammatical subjects of clauses also revealed large differences between the two groups of writers. Of the total number of 121 clauses in the low-rated essays, 81% were pronominal in nature. In contrast, of the 154 subjects of clauses in the high-rated essays, only 51% were pronominal. The results suggest that the writers of the high-rated essays were clearly using words to create meaning in different ways than were the writers of the low-rated papers.

        "description":"Research indicates that most blacks shift between a variety of social registers to produce inherent variability in the features of their speech, which in turn causes problems for college composition instruction. Writing teachers must avoid holding a stereotypic view of black speech, be sensitive to the varying social registers of black speech, and make black students understand that the use of standard English variants does not necessitate a rejection of the students' own culture in favor of white middle class culture. Black students are accustomed to performing in high context situations, where there is a high degree of familiarity with the situation and the people in it and, consequently, an awareness of what social register of language to use. This contrasts with the writing  classroom's low context environment and low degree of shared knowledge. By demonstrating the differences between formal, low context style and informal, high context style, and noting when each should be used, writing teachers can be more effective in helping black students make the transition to college writing.

These contexts include awareness of audience, knowledge of purpose, and creation of the proper voice befitting the purpose and audience. The critical necessity of these three elements in writing can be taught and learned most effectively through the study of literature, because literature by its very nature is an authentic voice speaking in a fully imagined context to fully imagined auditors or readers. Studying literature also increases students' abilities to use their imaginations and to maintain a critical awareness of what constitutes good writing. The aims of one technique for using literature to teach students about writing contexts are to present the author as a writer,  to help the student reader think as a writer, and to create an identification between these writers that facilitates the transfer of writing technique from the professional to the student writer. This teaching technique involves both using the literary author's first and intermediate drafts as examples of how writing is revised for greatest effect by constantly imagining the desired context, and having student writers complete writing assignments similar to the assignment the author accomplished in the literary work.

The students wrote one personal essay in a timed and videotaped session. During half of this session, the students wrote and planned as they normally would in an impromptu situation. During the second half of the session, however, the students used a technique termed &quot;blind writing&quot; in which they wrote with pens that had no ink and on paper that allowed no trace of the writing. Visible copies of the writing were obtained through the use of carbon paper. After the 20-minute writing episode, each student read his or her complete product and discussed the entire episode and the strategies employed in  producing the writing. Analysis of the writing was limited to the semantic structures of the texts and focused on two levels: the microstructure, or small units of meaning, and the macrostructure, or the coherence networks created to tie the small units together. The analysis indicated no difference between the make-up of the text bases of the visible and the blind writing for either group of students. However, all writers indicated that at some point in their writing they had stopped to read what had been written, suggesting that reading is intrinsically related to writing.

Six levels of oral communication ability are listed and discussed: (1) assessing one's own speaking ability, (2) speaking with analytic consciousness, (3) speaking effectively (advanced training), (4) integrating effective speaking within the framework of academic disciplines, (5) integrating theory with effective speaking, and (6) speaking  effectively within a multimedia context and with advanced content. For each of these performance levels, learning objectives and evaluation criteria and methods are offered.

The analysis of variance placed gender of the instructor, gender of the student, and type of course (public speaking or interpersonal communication) as the dependent variables, while course grade was the independent variable. The results showed that females received higher grades than males, regardless of the course in which they were enrolled. The type of course did not yield significantly different grading patterns, nor did female and male instructors appear to grade in a significantly different  manner. However, further examination of the trends in the analysis of variance indicated that male instructors tended to grade slightly lower than female instructors in both kinds of classes, and that grades in the interpersonal communication course tended to be slightly higher than the grades in the public speaking course.

The paper notes that this perspective was derived from the legal community's experiences in deciding court cases and discusses how the legal version of the approach has been misapplied in the field of debate. It argues that judges in the law embrace a form of &quot;tabula rasa&quot; as a method of putting aside preconceptions in order to fairly evaluate issues, but that they also recognize that the perspective, if taken to an extreme, can produce inaccurate and unfair decisions. Debate judges, it continues, have not been  so willing to adopt this limited version of &quot;tabula rasa.&quot; By accepting the passive, unlimited version of &quot;tabula rasa,&quot; debate judges have shifted the balance of argument in debate toward procedural issues and away from substantive questions of fact and policy. The paper proposes an active, but limited, &quot;tabula rasa&quot; model of debate evaluation that is designed to remedy such problems.

Community in this sense is best defined as a communication-engendered, psychological construct based upon consensual perceptions of common identity, interdependence, obligation, and efficacy. Community exists, then, when individuals sense that it exists as a result of their interactions with other individuals. What is not clear at present is what communication skills are minimally essential for the creation of community. What is clear  is that there is opportunity for communicative research about how communication is or can be used instrumentally to sustain and enhance consensual perceptions of identity, interdependence and obligation, and efficacy among community residents. To argue the value of community study is nothing more than to urge that community as a level of social organization should be included in any effort to account for the complexity of human communicative behavior.

The 88 subjects in the study were assigned to dyadic relationships, with the dyads working together on various tasks throughout the semester of an introductory speech class. Uncertainty level and five dimensions of disclosure level (amount, intent, honesty, depth, and positiveness of disclosures) were measured three times during the semester. Results indicated that a combination of the five dimensions of self-disclosure failed to predict uncertainty levels at any time. As hypothesized, uncertainty level decreased over time and amount of disclosure increased over time. However, perceptions of intent of disclosure, honesty of disclosure, and depth of  disclosure--all of which were hypothesized to increase over time--fluctuated, while positiveness of disclosure did not significantly change over time. Failure to support the hypotheses may have been the result of the poor reliability and inadequate validity of the self-disclosure instrument and the laboratory-type setting. (RL)",

To capture the gravity of this dilemma, the paper focuses on a television documentary, &quot;Scared Straight,&quot; that liberally used profanity, and contends that there is no principled way to distinguish between the language that resulted in the &quot;Pacifica&quot; decision and that used in the television documentary unless the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) uses content criteria. The paper  presents a brief history of the events leading to the &quot;Pacifica&quot; decision and then examines the FCC's interpretation of this decision. It then focuses on &quot;Scared Straight,&quot; emphasizing the FCC's reasons for not finding the program's language indecent. In conclusion, the paper speculates on the implications of &quot;Pacifica&quot; for both broadcasters and the FCC. (FL)",

        "description":"The results obtained by researchers interested in the speech-time relationship indicate that the sequential organization through time of speech sounds necessary for communication requires a universal &quot;grammar&quot; consisting of vowel and consonant sequences and an awareness of the duration experienced in that process, as well as the memory of its sequence. The elementary aspects of speech timing can only arise with infant babbling. A study of infant speech timing examined whether the perceived temporal characteristics of infant speech changed to reflect increased voluntary control of speech timing when the child achieved an unsupported, upright seated position. An analysis of tape recorded infant babblings obtained over several weeks revealed that (1) utterance durations decreased  with time and became more uniform, or less variable; (2) the infants seemed to form a preference for consonant/vowel types, practice them, then use them often but more selectively; and (3) the infants began to use breath control to pattern sound with time. Thus, the changing skills observable in the speech data suggest voluntary control of speech series and an underlying emergence of cognitive functioning in segmented time, or temporality. (HOD)",

        "description":"Behavioral effects studies of mediated violence have traditionally focused on four paradigms: limited effects/reinforcement, instigation, imitation, and catharsis. The catharsis perspective suggests that the desire or need to exhibit aggressive or hostile behaviors is reduced by a release of those desires through vicarious or behavioral participation. Clearly those individuals unable to fantasize will have little or no catharsis, whereas those who have a higher ability to fantasize will be better able to engage in catharsis, thus reducing their overt aggression. Despite the importance of the fantasy ability both conceptually and methodologically, it is not measured in most media effects studies. Of primary importance for media researchers is the realization that catharsis will  not function equally for all. Second, researchers must attempt to denote what types of mediated messages stimulate the greatest fantasy involvement on the part of the viewer. Third, exploration of the content of fantasies must be attempted. And fourth, fantasy may be a mediating variable between heavy media viewing and overt behavioral aggression. In summary, catharsis is a paradigm that too often is rejected due to public and private opinion that mediated violence must have some negative impact on viewers. A reformulation of the catharsis paradigm to include levels of fantasy ability, the type of mediated message that best triggers fantasies, and the content of the fantasies evoked could provide a resurgence of interest in catharsis as an effect of viewing mediated violence.

The portion of the model dealing with mass media included the new concept &quot;quasi-mass media,&quot; which involves more personalized types of communication that still maintain standardized forms of content and distribution (such as public access cable television, trade magazines, professional journals, newsletters, church bulletins, and specialized newspapers). A linear structural relations (LISREL) analysis of the data revealed that (1) length of residence, education, use of print mass media, and use of quasi-mass media were positive predictors of voting; (2) use of electronic  mass media was a negative predictor of voting; (3) use of print mass media, use of quasi-mass media, and community integration were positive predictors of political participation; and (4) length of residence and use of quasi-mass media were positive predictors of community integration, while use of electronic mass media was a negative predictor of community integration. Overall, the study illustrated the importance of specifying a process model of communication effects, and demonstrated the value of the concept of quasi-mass media. (RL)",

The next five papers discuss the roles of the national government, school boards, regional advisory councils, and local educational agencies in England in educational quality control. The following section's three papers ponder the  problems involved in improving education through staff development. These look at further (or adult) education institutions, management-staff conflict, and participative management in elementary and secondary schools. Two further papers review the &quot;politics&quot; of educational quality control, particularly the problems of value judgments in assessing quality and of teachers' reactions to school amalgamations that threaten jobs. Cost-benefit analysis is used in the final two papers to examine the costs of local educational inspectors and to suggest a method of monitoring educational efficiency. (Author/RW)",

The program's three emphases include responsiveness, defined as participation by all interested groups in the improvement of the school system; evaluation of administrators and programs; and accountability through open communication of program results. REASONS centers on the identification of the district's missions, starting with a survey of students, staff, parents, and the community for  their suggestions. From the survey results the school board adopts mission statements which guide the management team in developing objectives at the system, unit, individual, and daily-operations levels. Individual contracts are drawn up for each administrator based on these four-tiered objectives. Peer evaluation of administrators and merit pay decisions are based on these contracts. REASONS itself is evaluated annually by a special committee. Copies of the survey and contract forms are provided. (Author/RW)",

The requirements for the professional supervisor certificate are a valid Texas teacher certificate, three years' teaching experience, and completion of a 30-semester-hour graduate program in supervision. Southwest Texas State University (SWTSU) offers a 45-semester-hour certification program that includes a 36-hour master's degree with a major in supervision. Some degree of specialization is permitted in a number of areas. The culminating activity in the supervision program is the internship practicum. The internship's emphasis is on the supervisor's role as a change agent or leader whose major  responsibility is improvement of instruction. Special focus is placed on mastering competencies in three major educational sub-systems--personnel, curriculum, and instruction.

The result has been an increasing realization of the need for improved university preparation programs and for more effective Human Resource Development (HRD) for practicing administrators. A growing body of research shows a very positive relationship between the leadership ability of principals and student growth in basic skill achievement. A comprehensive HRD program for potential or practicing school administrators requires substantial time, must be a sustained effort, and entails four major components. The first component is training in leader behavior. Administrators need to be helped to be sensitive to alternative models of leader behavior and to the human behavior  aspects of leadership. The second component, training in management skills, involves the classic management functions of planning, organizing, and directing. The third component, training in instructional leadership, includes curriculum development, clinical supervision, staff development, and teacher evaluation. The final component of a comprehensive HRD program is the traditional administration course, covering such topics as school finance, theory, law, personnel, collective bargaining, public relations, and educational technology.

        "description":"The 26th annual survey of public elementary and secondary education conducted in fall 1979 by the National Center for Education Statistics yielded data on school districts, enrollment, administrative and teaching staffs, pupil-teacher ratios, high school completions (graduations and equivalency certificates), revenue sources, and expenditures, including per-pupil spending. The 24 tables and two graphs presented here cover all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Marianas, and the nation's 20 largest cities. Historical information provides data on some factors back to 1975. The survey reveals declines in total enrollment, in numbers of schools and school districts, and in teachers' real incomes. The number of teachers and of high  school completions did not change but the cost per pupil of public education, in current dollars, rose slightly. An appendix describes the nature and conduct of the annual survey. (Author/RW)",

        "description":"Administrators spend most of their time on noninstructional matters. Because they excuse this by claiming that nothing is known of the learning process, they need a systematic ordering of the basic, verified knowledge on learning. For instance, findings in learning research show that the capacity to learn school subjects is far more widely distributed than was thought, that achievement is strongly interrelated with affective factors like self-esteem, and that testing can be used to improve teaching and learning processes as well as to classify students. Researchers have also gathered data on teaching activities and school structures and relationships that affect learning. Educational administrators can no longer maintain that we lack knowledge on learning processes, and they  should take responsibility for using the knowledge gathered. However, most research and training in educational administration has focused on administrative behavior and matters unrelated to classroom learning rather than on school effects, student social patterns, and classroom-level variables. Among the implications of learning research findings are that administrators should reassert instructional leadership, foster staff development, and implement new school and classroom organizational patterns based on the research.

After a brief profile of Austin, the report describes how the project started in a poor inner-city barrio because of its neighborhood council's concern over social problems among local youths and adults. After its initial success, the project expanded to a suburb across the city. A task force was then formed to study possible citywide expansion. The task force considered four models of project financing and governance involving the city, the school district, and the community. It chose an organizational model allowing joint control, in  which the district administered the project, the city and the district supplied funds and long-term planning, and a consortium combining all three groups provided top-level advice. Under this organizational structure the project expanded further. The author also discusses the administrative problems addressed by the task force, including citizen involvement, decentralized administration, and bureaucratic territoriality, and assesses the project's current programs.

Zones of indifference describe the extent to which people will respond to orders or directives issued by authority figures. The following procedures were followed in the development of the instrument. One hundred twenty-five teachers submitted 134 usable items of typical directives issued by their supervising administrator. The items fit into four categories of acceptability, ranging from acceptable without question to clearly unacceptable. These items were then field-tested with 104 teachers in four states. Various computer manipulations, including a principal component analysis of the responses,  identified two factors or sets of items. One set appears to explain variables describing teacher-determined practices while the other covers administrator-determined policy. The appendices contain the initial instrument of 134 items, the computer analysis results, and the final instrument of 78 items labeled as to the factor each item represents. (Author/MLF)",

The GIS was also administered to a random sample of ten teachers who work with twenty-nine of the administrators who had taken the leadership class. Computation of a zero-order correlation coefficient obtained a significant positive relationship between the two sets of scores on five of the ten items on the GIS. The implications for this are that, since certain behavioral characteristics displayed in a leadership class are stable, the challenge to administrator preparation programs is to design remedial measures to assist prospective administrators in changing low-rated behavior patterns before assuming an administrative  position.

The history of advisory committees is covered from the 1940s on, with an emphasis on their expansion in the 1960s under the impetus of the civil rights movement and the War on Poverty. The types of advisory committees listed include permanent or temporary committees, districtwide or single-school groups, and citizen-initiated committees versus those mandated by school districts or governmental bodies. The authors note that advisory committees have fulfilled numerous functions; they have been assessment or review boards, have determined needs, and have provided services. Among the  areas committees have covered, say the authors, are curriculum, facilities and resources, public relations, and career guidance. The committee problems mentioned here include uncertainty in goals or functions, apathy, nonrepresentativeness, factionalism, inadequate time, and faulty scheduling or communication. The report also cites school administrators' problems with committees, including committees' costs and their tendency to be unwieldy and to exceed their authority. (Author/RW)",

Revenues and expenditures for each state are also broken down into percentages and the data on individual school systems are given in both aggregate and per-pupil amounts. A comparison of national data shows that revenues increased 10.6 percent from 1978-1979 to 1979-1980 and that expenditures rose 11 percent. However, public schools still took in more than they spent in each year. Fifty-five percent of general school revenues in 1979-1980 came from federal, state, or local  governments; the rest came from the districts' own sources. Most school expenditures went for salaries and wages (61.6 percent) while 7.5 percent consisted of capital outlays. Long-term debt accounted for over 96 percent of all school debt.

To put this into practice, personnel with the Mid-continent Regional Educational Laboratory (McREL) have pulled together findings from a variety of studies and developed a workshop series to present the findings to local educators. The topics covered depend on the requirements of the schools involved. For example, one way to improve learning is to help teachers develop effective strategies for operating their classrooms during the first few days of school. The workshops begin by having teachers and administrators calculate the amount of time  they devote to instructional activities during the typical school day, their students' engagement rates, and their success rates. Then they decide what areas to target for improvement. The McREL workshop series offers teachers and administrators a research-based foundation on which to build a total school improvement effort. It provides tools for assessing current practices as well as strategies for improving building and classroom management and student testing procedures. (Author/MLF)",

Each section contains the criteria  for judging quality, a guide for collecting information, and work sheets for preparing suggestions on program improvement. Each quality criterion is measured on a seven-point scale from high effectiveness to low effectiveness. This scale is based on three paragraphs describing school programs with high, middle, or low effectiveness. The reviewer decides which description best fits each aspect of the program.

        "description":"To assist the North Carolina League of Middle/Junior High Schools, this paper briefly surveys the literature on developmental characteristics of early adolescents and the characteristics of effective teachers and also discusses the implications of the findings for instruction and the curriculum. The authors first define early adolescence as the ages from 10 or 11 to 14 or 15 and then describe early adolescents' physical, social, emotional, and intellectual development, including the problems of exceptional adolescents. Their discussion of effective teachers and teaching techniques covers teacher expectations and other general characteristics; teacher self-esteem and leadership; classroom management skills; teacher-directed and student-initiated learning; and students' time on  task. The paper's final section explores the implications for instruction and the curriculum both of the data gathered on adolescents and teachers and of theories of cognitive and ego development and developmental task sequences.

        "description":"To explain discrepancies in Utah's elementary school test results under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act's Title I Evaluation and Reporting System (TIERS), researchers investigated the adequacy and validity of TIERS evaluation models. Model A (norm-referenced testing) is used in most Utah school districts, in preference to Models B or C (both involving comparisons with control groups). The researchers reviewed previous research and conducted four projects that (1) compared test results under Models A and B, (2) assessed how well Utah's tests met Model A's assumptions, (3) analyzed the effects of test formats, and (4) examined the impact of training students and teachers in test taking and administering. Using tests, interviews, and observation, the projects analyzed  test scores, educators' attitudes, and students' and teachers' test behaviors in several school districts, especially the Salt Lake City School District. The results indicate that (1) Model A overestimates Title I's impact, (2) most of Model A's assumptions are met, (3) test format heavily affects test results, and (4) training students and teachers to take and give tests improves scores.

This study describes and analyzes the courts' use of the irreparable harm standard in anti-strike injunction proceedings that involve teachers and school boards. The project includes analyses of previous litigation and legislation concerning the irreparable harm standard's use in teacher strikes. The major portion of the project involved gathering field data in settings where strikes and injunction proceedings occurred during 1978 and 1979. Field data are presented thematically rather than site-by-site. In addition, questionnaires were completed by 129 (82  percent) of the superintendents who experienced strikes during 1978-79. In the appendices are more detailed accounts of case law; data from a number of the field settings; a state-by-state inventory of pertinent statutory provisions; a comprehensive analysis of the treatment of the irreparable harm standard by the appellate courts; and the results of the questionnaire survey of superintendents who experienced strikes.

Considerations in designing timeout procedures are noted, and the effectiveness of timeout when viewed as a punishment is discussed. Legal challenges to behavior modification uses are briefly addressed. A longitudinal study involving 29 emotionally disturbed children (6 to 13 years old) in a residential treatment program revealed that, based on timeout frequencies, both exclusion (E:TO) and isolation (I:TO) timeouts appeared to result in short-term control rather than alteration of problem behavior. Data indicated that E:TO can have an exacerbating or additive effect, and that I:TO efficacy is greater with lower severity behaviors and for shorter durations. It is concluded that  the use of timeout as an intervention underlying an entire treatment program seems ill-advised and unlikely to meet the children's individual treatment goals. (CL)",

        "description":"This paper challenges the characterization of bilingual behavior derived from the code-switching model, and especially the notion of linguistic independence on which psychological studies of bilingualism have focused almost exclusively. While linguists have concentrated on the situational determinants of code-switching, psychologists have focused on the bilingual's ability to keep his two language systems separate. In the process, the phenomenon of code mixing, that is, switching between languages in an unchanged speech situation and within a single sentence, has been neglected. However, recent linguistic studies have shown that the use of both languages in the same discourse and even within a single sentence is quite common. Such code-mixing has been shown to be an effective,  versatile communicative strategy, subject to a number of interlingual syntactic constraints. Discussion focuses on some of these constraints, showing that they have implications for a psychological model of bilingual information processing. Emphasis is placed on: (1) their relevance to issues such as the single versus separate storage hypothesis, (2) the language switch model and models of sentence production, (3) the psychological reality of syntactic constituents, and (4) the relationship between language units and thought units.

        "description":"Ethnic/race relations among trustees, administrators, faculty, and professional nonfaculty who were affiliated with colleges and universities located in the Southeastern United States during the late 1970s were examined. The macroscopic theory of the split labor market (Bonacich, 1979) was modified and tested within an institutional framework. Basically, the theory suggests that race questions are really class questions in that one racial group may be identified as cheaper paid labor while the other may be identified as high priced labor. Historical perspectives on black Americans and the evolution of American higher education from 1619 to 1980 also are considered at length. A survey of three traditional black (TBI) and four traditionally white (TWI) institutions assessed such  issues as the following: the historical mission of the institution, whether the goals of desegregation correlate or conflict with its historical mission, and whether there is a specific affirmative action/equal employment opportunity program at the institution. The survey data and interviews point clearly to a split in the labor market between higher and cheaper paid labor. Higher paid labor, whether they were blacks at TBIs or whites at TWIs, experienced greater job security, greater degrees of job satisfaction, and less institutional alienation than cheaper paid labor. Those in the majority more often did not support and saw little need for affirmative action/equal employment opportunity programs that would produce greater numbers of minority professional employees at their  institutions. A bibliography, sample questionnaire, and letters are appended. (SW)",

The list of facilities is a guide to what uncommon equipment, centers or institutes, and collections are available at western higher education facilities and what provisions exist for sharing those facilities. The information was obtained through mail requests in late 1979 to all residents and public information officers in all graduate-level colleges and universities in the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education region. The respondents nominated unique facilities, verified the accuracy of the description, and categorized the facility's work into primary and secondary research fields. The catalog contains 294  entries that include equipment, such as electron microscopes and nuclear reactors; centers or research institutes, such as laboratories and land preserves; and collections, such as specialized libraries or art galleries. Each entry contains a description of the facility, the name and address of the director or another individual to contact for further information, and the arrangement through which researchers may use the facility. While some facilities are open to the public, others are more restricted and require individual arrangements. The catalog is organized into 14 chapters, which represent the primary research applications of the facilities. There are two indexes: one lists the facilities by institution; the other by primary and secondary research fields. A facility description  form is appended. (SW)",

According to Daniel F. Detzner, General College is one of several colleges involved with INSIGHT, which was initiated by inmates and continues to be administered by its founder and a staff of three inmates. It is a nonprofit corporation funded by contributions from more than 30 local businesses and foundations and has as its primary goal the achievement of the bachelor's degree for participants. Bruce Schelske, Sharyn Schelske, and Mary Haywood describe the Upward  Bound project as a college preparatory program with an eight-week summer program and a less intensive school year program. The curriculum stresses basic skills and is individualized to meet each student's needs. An important part of the summer program is the bridge program, which introduces high school graduates to the college system. Among its various features are tutoring, stipends, and the use of behavioral modification techniques to motivate students to set and accomplish educational goals. According to Thomas M. Skovholt, Andrew F. Nelson, and Michael R. Rothweiler, the Day Community serves adolescents experiencing academic and/or social/family problems by combining academic studies, therapeutic education, group and individual counseling, experiential and art therapy, parent  training, and many recreational activities. It also provides university students with internships and field experiences. (SW)",

        "description":"Hearings held before the Senate Subcommittee on Education, Arts, and Humanities on the Student Assistance Amendments of 1981 are presented, along with the text of S. 1108. A major objective of the bill is to amend Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to emphasize the element of need in the Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) program and the Direct Student Loan Program. It would eliminate convenience borrowing in the GSL program, but it would retain the critically important in-school interest subsidy for all students, while affording middle income families with high college costs continued access to loans. In the Pell grant program, S. 1108 would allow the Secretary of Education to establish a series of progressive assessment rates on discretionary income, subject to the  congressional review process, which would offer greater equity to the lowest income students for whom the program was intended. Attention also is directed to the Reagan plan, which proposes to reduce student GSL demand by eliminating the interest-free feature on all new loans and to limit eligibility on the basis of need. The Administration proposal also would charge a market rate of interest for the recently authorized parent loan option under the GSL program. Supplementary materials include: a discussion paper from the Washington office of the College Board, &quot;Options for Controlling Federal Costs While Preserving Needed Credit for College;&quot; and &quot;Votes by Which Higher Education Legislation Passed Since 1965, Date of First Enactment,&quot; submitted by Senator Randolph.

        "description":"The services that have been provided by colleges and universities in the United States and the current confusion regarding the role of American higher education are reviewed. Among the contributions made by higher education are: extending higher learning to new classes of people, advancing the nation's frontiers, providing scientific expertise during wartime, and helping veterans return to rewarding civilian pursuits. Presently, the external needs for higher learning's services are apparently less urgent than in the past and colleges are questioning their purposes in society. Three historic functions of higher education are examined: teaching, research, and service. It is suggested that there are new challenges for higher education. Colleges must not only teach, but must also  educate a generation of students quite different from those of the past. Not only must they conduct research, but they must do so with reduced federal support and must consider enticing but potentially compromising allegiances with the private sector. As a new approach to service, public policy studies for all students are advocated, with special encouragement for a new program of civic education for adults. It is proposed that colleges and universities help students and teachers use knowledge wisely so that higher education's dual role as servant and critic of society may be protected and advanced.

Questionnaires were mailed in December 1978 to all chief executive officers (president or chancellor), or chief executive officer for a system of colleges, universities, and central offices listed on the 1977-78 Higher Education General Information Survey. Though nearly one-third of all public institutions responded, less than one-fifth of private institutions did. Among the three institutional types, universities had the highest response rate (33 percent), followed by two-year institutions (28 percent), and by four-year institutions (25 percent). Public universities and public four-year colleges had the highest response  rates (38 percent), and private two-year colleges the lowest (14 percent). Based on 900 returned and usable questionnaires of the total 3,327, the highest priority areas were: (1) communicating institutional strengths to potential students, their parents, and the general public; (2) communicating institutional strengths to the state legislature and state budget officials (for public institutions); (3) integrating program-review results in program-planning and budget processes; (4) resource allocation and reallocation; (5) faculty vitality and renewal; (6) implementing institutional goals and objectives through the planning and budgeting process; and (7) forecasting institutional revenue needs more accurately. Most of these high priority areas were interpreted as reflecting the current  environment of retrenchment and the need to prepare for a no-growth or slow-growth era. (SW)",

The following areas are addressed: determination of courses to be offered, standards of credit courses offered at off-campus locations, faculty, administrative organization and academic policy, resources and facilities, student services, and credit for prior learning awarded by examination or by nontraditional assessment methods. The guidelines are recommended for all higher education institutions in Missouri. The most important element in the guidelines is the belief that off-campus activities should evolve from the on-campus programmatic strengths and academic expertise of the institution. Equally  important is the conviction that there should not be a double standard to any aspect of the educational activity of an institution. In early 1980, the representatives to Missouri's three Regional Coordinating Councils agreed that all institutions should conduct self-studies regarding off-campus courses. In responding to the standards contained in the guidelines, institutions were asked to identify strengths and weaknesses of their off-campus offerings. In addition, a survey of off-campus offerings was conducted by the Missouri Department of Higher Education to provide institutions with information to aid in long-range planning, and to ascertain where there appear to be problems of unnecessary duplication. Appended survey results include: course title, credit hours awarded, enrollment,  status of faculty (full-time/adjunct), and course location. (SW)",

From a list of public institutions known to have awarded honorary degrees in the recent past, several were selected for interviews relative to their policies and practices in selection and award. The list and a summary of interviews with representatives of 15 major universities are appended. In a followup survey, senior academic officers of honorary degree-granting institutions were asked their perceptions of the value of their programs. No pattern related to type or prestige of the institution was found for institutions having an honorary degree program. Among those having such a program, honorary degrees awarded by faculty for scholarly excellence were well regarded, while nonacademic honorary  degrees were viewed often as being more trouble than their worth to the institution. Information is presented on the results of telephone surveys with the following institutions: Michigan State University, Louisiana State University, North Carolina State University, University of Maryland, University of Georgia, University of Florida, Purdue University, University of Missouri, University of Arizona, University of Tennessee at Knoxville, and the University of Virginia. At the University of Virginia, tradition is that honorary degrees are not awarded. The University of Georgia system awards honorary degrees only to a U.S. President who has attended one of the colleges or universities of the system. The other schools do award honorary degrees, although the frequency and criteria for awards  differ. (SW)",

Applicants who are accepted have to be approved at Round Table, where their cases are considered for 30 days by 13 admission officers. These Round Table discussions of specific applicants, whose identities are concealed, are presented to illustrate the deliberations. Additionally, conversations with admissions officers and a candidate provide further perspectives. More than 8,000 high school seniors applied to Dartmouth, and only 1,800 were accepted. Each application, at least 13 pages with four essay questions, is read by three admissions officers. Three &quot;yes&quot; votes generally mean the candidate is accepted, while three &quot;no&quot; votes mean rejection. About  500 get accepted that way, and 1,000 places are filled at Round Table. Through this process, students are assigned an academic rating and a personal rating. Dartmouth trains and uses 2,700 volunteer alumni to interview candidates, some of whom get flags for a special talent or commitment. At Round Table the presenting officer serves as advocate and tries to get the candidate voted into the highest possible Drawer (1, 2, or 3). Typically, the committee spent five to 12 minutes on each candidate before voting. The committee looks for a student who can handle the academic curriculum at Dartmouth but who also will be able to contribute in some area. They may pursue a particular interest or activity in depth. Special considerations, like athletic ability or race, also are addressed, and the  admissions procedures of schools like Harvard and Yale are briefly noted. (SW)",

Over half the 43 schools in Canada and the United States that offer the program are public. For the approximately 1,200 high school juniors and seniors in North America enrolled in the program, admission into most foreign colleges and advanced standing at many American colleges are likely outcomes. Students take either individual honors courses, or a full program that can lead to a special diploma once the student passes rigorous exams graded by the international office. Students working for the diploma are required to take five enriched courses and one elective: a foreign language, math, an experimental  science, and a social studies course like history or economics. The seventh required course, Theory of Knowledge, concentrates not just on learning, but on the experience of learning. Each participating school pays about $3,500 a year in international dues, and a few thousand dollars for special textbooks and teacher training in the first year. Students pay up to $200 for the final exams. Included in the transcripts are: a class discussion on theory of knowledge, student discussion on how learning affects the rest of their lives, a principal's views on why the program was needed, a history class discussion of how bias affects one's interpretation of history, students' perceptions of pressure from the program and from senior exams, and a teacher's reaction to added pressure.

The TRIO/Special Services Program at the University of Minnesota is located within The General College, which is the open enrollment unit of the university. The program has four components: the integrated course of study, counseling services, tutorial services, and the summer institute. The courses include a survival seminar course, which concentrates on study skills, career planning, and stress management; a writing lab; math courses; and courses in areas such as urban problems, arts and psychology. The summer institute, which is examined in detail, is available for entering low income  freshmen during the summer prior to their first fall quarter. During the 1980-81 academic year, TRIO services were used by 248 students. A student survey was administered in the fall of 1980 and readministered in the spring of 1981. It was found that TRIO/Special Services students began college with several handicaps to academic success. They had poor basic skills, low income, and were from nontraditional backgrounds. However, a higher percentage of the TRIO students stayed in school, completing a higher proportion of credits than a low income control group, and maintained a grade point average comparable to the control group. Case studies of two TRIO students, exit reviews, course/instructor evaluations, and an evaluation of the writing lab sequence also are included. (SW)",

        "description":"Developments and trends in the education of black undergraduates in predominantly white colleges from 1973 through 1977 were assessed by three national surveys. Almost 800 black undergraduates at a representative sample of 40 predominantly white, four-year colleges were interviewed during each survey. Attention was directed to academic performance, resegregation, student educational and socioeconomic background, finances, special admissions, level of satisfaction, and post-college plans. In 1973 the top three characteristics that black students considered important in their choice of college were: financial aid (53 percent), proximity to home (50 percent), and academic reputation (48 percent). By 1977 the pattern had changed: academic reputation (64 percent), financial aid (39  percent), and proximity to home (38 percent). The findings indicate that black students are an extremely diverse group both in backgrounds and attitudes. Analyses were conducted in relation to sex, the racial composition of high school, parents' income, parents' education, college selectivity, public versus private colleges, urban versus rural, and region. By 1977 there was a decreased tendency to view the black community as an inherently disadvantaged environment, and a sizable proportion of black undergraduates were considered traditional students rather than nontraditional students (i.e., educational preparation and socioeconomic background). The overwhelming majority of black students complained about levels of black enrollment and employment at their colleges. A bibliography and  questionnaire are appended. (SW)",

The review conducted by the U.S. General Accounting Office focused on the department's efforts and plans to correct system deficiencies, the reasonableness and propriety of major system costs incurred, and the contractor's performance under the most recent system contract awarded in April 1979. It was found that the system continued to be deficient in four functional areas: the automatic reinsurance of state agency loans regardless of whether the student is qualified under the law and regulations; interest and special allowance payments; the collection of insurance premiums on federal loans; and the accumulation and reporting of the program's financial  status in accordance with the needs of the department's financial managers. It is recommended that the needs of users of the Guaranteed Student Loan system should be identified and translated into specifications for meeting these needs. The department should follow a design approach that will assure that these management features are adequately incorporated in the program's automated information system. Additionally, it was found that existing operations were converted to a new contractor with minimal service impact, but added costs were incurred and key contract elements remain to be accepted.

        "description":"The efforts of schools to administer and collect student loans and the actions of the U.S. Department of Education for collecting defaulted loans under the National Direct Student Loan program were investigated. The General Accounting Office visited seven schools in the midwest with default rates ranging from 5.9 to 63.1 percent and obtained information on 599 defaulted loans. Six of these schools had default rates exceeding 20 percent. Information also was obtained on defaults and collections for 33 other schools in the same geographical area with default rates exceeding 20 percent. It is concluded that the seven schools that were visited did not fully comply with the department's loan collection procedures, although they did an adequate job sending bills and collection letters.  It is suggested that schools need to adopt a tougher attitude toward collecting defaulted loans, and the Department of Education should take stronger actions against those that fail to do so. Schools have forwarded to the department for collection about 240,000 loans with outstanding balances of $215 million. But various problems have slowed the department's collection efforts. The department plans to contract with private collection agencies for future loan collections. Also, to motivate defaulters to pay their debts, the Department of Education will allow credit bureaus to redisclose student loan default data to the general credit industry. Additional recommendations to the Department of Education are included. (SW)",

        "description":"Funding and enrollment issues facing higher education are considered in two articles. In \"Funding for Higher Education Enrollment Shifts in the 80s,\" David S. Spence outlines the decline in number of traditional college-age students; the trend to older, part-time, place-bound students; the increasing demands for remedial, continuing, and occupation-related education; and how these developments may affect different kinds of institutions. State actions aimed at recognizing fixed and variable costs in higher education budgets are described. These actions are designed to enable institutional expenditures to be raised or lowered at a different rate than enrollment changes. As variations or program budgeting grows, legislatures are likely to check more closely on whether funds  appropriated to higher education are spent specifically on the programs for which they are requested. In \"An Institutional Perspective on Funding for Higher Education Enrollment Shifts in the 80s,\" L. Felix Joyner views the problems of enrollment shifts based on experiences with a state system composed of 16 universities (North Carolina). Many of the alternate funding proposals seek to lessen the financial distress for institutions that are still growing. This is viewed as politically and practically unsound, and it is suggested that minor adjustments to current funding practices be made, rather than adopting substantially different ones. (SW)",

While it is noted that the acquisition cost of maintenance simulators was typically less than that of actual equipment trainers, the report cautions that this finding must be qualified  by the fact that effectiveness is based primarily on school achievement rather than on-the-job performance, and cost figures are based primarily on acquisition rather than on life cycle costs.

        "description":"Designed to investigate the existing attitudes of students and instructors toward the computer managed instruction (CMI) learning environment, this research project also identified factors relating to these attitudes. Questionnaires were developed and administered to 100 instructors and 255 trainees from five schools taught under the CMI system. In general, trainee and instructor questionnaires contained items exploring attitudes toward the CMI system in the learning environment, demographics, interactions with instructors or students, and motivations. Response data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results of the study indicated that trainees' attitudes toward the CMI system in the learning environment were generally favorable, while those of  instructors were generally not favorable. The study also revealed that trainees' length of service with the Navy appears to be related to attitudes toward the CMI system in the learning environment: the longer the trainee is in the service, the more negative the individual tends to be toward the system. Copies of the student and instructor questionnaires are appended and 13 references are listed. (Author/LLS)",

        "author":["Callan, Pat"],
        "description":"The systems of finance and governance of California's state universities and colleges and its community colleges have differed significantly. While the four-year institutions have been funded from the state budget, prior to 1978, the community colleges depended largely on local property taxes for revenue supplemented by state apportionments to redress imbalances between poor and wealthy districts. Proposition 13 drastically altered community college financing by reducing property tax revenues, mandating county- rather than districtwide collection of property taxes, and eliminating the district's authority to set or alter tax rates. Senate Bill 154 (SB 154) implemented a &quot;target budget&quot; approach in 1978-79 to mitigate the community colleges' immediate financial crisis. Later,  Assembly Bill 8 (AB 8) sought to alleviate the rigidities of SB 154, return to enrollment-based funding, and maintain local control over budgets and expenditures. While AB 8 has generally been an effective measure, certain concerns, which have been recognized by the Assembly Education Committee, remain. These involve: (1) statutory versus budget-act approaches to community college finance; (2) free flow of students between districts; (3) the financial implications of program changes; (4) the effectiveness of incremental cost funding; and (5) the community colleges' overall mission in times of limited state resources. (The paper presents the position of the California Postsecondary Education Commission on these issues.) (HB)",

The survey instrument solicited information concerning; (1) the relationship of the graduate's job to his/her course of study; (2) reasons for not locating a job related to MCCC studies; and (3) the quality of MCCC with regard to practical and theoretical instruction, career orientation, placement services, required and elective courses, and academic advising. In addition, suggestions for improvement were sought through two open-ended questions. Selected findings,  based on a 67.3% response rate, reveal that 69.4% of the respondents had jobs related to their studies; the blending of theory and practice at MCCC was favorably rated by most graduates; and general education courses received slightly lower ratings than required vocational courses. The survey report summarizes findings and compares selected data with a similar study conducted in 1979.

        "description":"Since the implementation of an open admissions policy at Bronx Community College (BCC) in 1970, the majority of incoming students have been socially, economically, and academically disadvantaged. In 1978, one out of three students had a native language other than English; 46% came from households with an income of less than $5,000; 68% were placed in remedial reading or English courses; and 45% were placed in remedial mathematics courses. A consequence of these disadvantages and of a systemwide stiffening of academic standards in Fall 1976 was a large increase in the number of students suspended or placed on probation. In Fall 1977, 3,706 of 8,845 students failed to meet retention standards. In order to reduce the high attrition rate at BCC, a special seven-week course entitled  Probationary Workshop Program (PWP-99) was developed to focus on the reasons for and implications of probation, the revised grading system, academic regulations, and students' and teachers' responsibility for student success. Although the course was well received by participants, a study conducted in Spring 1979 revealed no significant relationship between participation in the course by probationary students and their academic performance that semester, and called for revisions of the course. These revisions should be based on a follow-up of students who took the course and performed well in their courses and a study of students who attended very few PWP-99 sessions.

First, the instructor's assumptions about teaching courses for elder students and the attitudes of elder students are discussed. Next, the initial problems arising from the different goals and interests of the students in the poetry writing course are outlined. Then, problems of course structure, student sensitivity about their work, and the students' lack of acquaintance with each other are detailed together  with the instructor's solutions. Next, the reasons for the failure of a course in autobiography taught outside the normal institutional setting are explored. The process of obtaining a grant for the publication of student memoirs and poetry and the students' involvement in the project is outlined. Finally, the conclusions reached about teaching courses to elders, i.e., that the process does not differ greatly from teaching younger students except that the former have more years, more memories, and some diminution of physical abilities, are discussed and the particular rewards of teaching elder students indicated.

        "author":["Casteen, John T., III"],
        "description":"Perspectives concerning the need to reform high school and college curricula and college admission standards are considered. Until the early 1960s, most U.S. colleges offered a traditional curriculum in the lower division, with emphasis on certain skills, such as writing and arithmetic reasoning, and also on communicating certain basic cultural values. Beginning about 1960, the traditional curriculum was displaced by the general education curriculum, which allowed students to choose within broad rubrics what kind of competence they would develop in college. There was a general reaction against mathematics and science, and foreign language requirements disappeared in many schools. The core curriculum movement, which was influenced by developments at Harvard University,  concentrates on specific and discrete skills that can be measured in reliable ways. The assumption is that the first year of study should be basically remedial, after which students should reach a level of competence that will allow them to advance to a complex second-year program that prepares students for a major program. There is a direct connection between this kind of curriculum and the efforts to reform the high school curriculum. The Southern Regional Education Board's views on the need for quality are presented in excerpts from &quot;The Need for Quality,&quot; and the College Board's Project EQuality is described. The Board is trying to redefine the core academic competencies that ought to be taught in high school and construct an academic curriculum to prepare students for college.  Additionally, the following concerns of legislators are discussed: higher education's role in improving the quality of high schools; and the validity of scholastic aptitude test scores. (SW)",

Respondent subgroups included rabbis, educators, cantors, and communal service workers. Social attitudes were measured by the Aging Semantic Differential (Rosencranz and McNevin, 1969). Respondents rated 32 dimensions for two categories of people: young people between 15 and 25 years old and old people between 65 and 75 years old. Both respondent groups perceived older people to be more autonomous or independent than young people, while they were more positive in their attitudes toward the young than the old on the issue of capacity for goal achievement or effectiveness. Additionally, when all attitudinal measures are aggregated, younger people were  given more positive ratings than the elderly by both students and graduates. The Facts on Aging Quiz (Palmore, 1977) also was administered to determine knowledge about aging. Students were least knowledgeable about the demography of aging, psychological stress and aging, boredom and old age, poverty, and religiosity in old age. Recent graduates displayed similar misconceptions. Students and graduates in the area of communal services obtained the highest scores, while those in the area of education obtained the lowest scores. It is recommended that more attention be given to learning about the human life cycle, age-related stresses, and societal changes. Additional recommendations are offered, and topical areas are suggested for the study of education, cantorial, rabbinical, and communal  service students. A bibliography is appended. (SW)",

        "description":"Graduate medical education (GME) in the military services was investigated with respect to the following concerns: the maximum capacity of each military medical department to conduct GME programs in its own hospital; how these programs affect the recruitment and retention of military physicians; and the optimal sizes of such programs. It is suggested that since the Navy and the Air Force are both approaching a new era in which physician shortages will no longer be a problem, the size of the GME programs--along with other physician manpower policies affecting recruitment, retention, promotion, and assignment of physicians--will have to be adjusted to function in a period of likely surpluses of physicians in many specialties. Based on site visits, it was concluded that all three  military medical departments probably have expanded their GME programs to the maximum capacity (based on currently available facilities and resources, including staff and patients) or slightly in excess of maximum capacity in some cases. The optimal size of the GME program is a function of the availability of the numbers and kinds of military physicians needed. Since the pertinent circumstances of each of the three medical departments are different, no basis was seen for assuming that all three departments should be required to operate with the same proportion of their active duty medical officers in GME status. It is recommended that the Department of Defense withdraw its 1977 directive to the three military medical departments to limit the fraction of active duty physicians in military  GME assignments to not more than 20 percent of the active duty physicians strength in 1985. Maintaining high quality military GME and scholarships is addressed. A bibliography and sample interview guides are appended. (SW)",

        "description":"The efficiency and effectiveness of using a group approach to advising by a team of faculty advisors were evaluated in 1980-81 at the General College, University of Minnesota. Group/team advising was compared to individualized, one-to-one advising of first-semester freshmen in terms of student satisfaction with advising, student understanding of General College policies and procedures, and faculty time spent advising. During scheduled registration periods, three days each registration week were set aside for group advising of the experimental group at a central advising location. Group advising sessions consisted of two hour time blocks per registration advising day. One to three members of the advising team were present at the advising session. Student folders were available in  advance to the team members, and specifically designed advising materials and techniques were used. A time report sheet and Student Satisfaction-Knowledge Questionnaire were developed and implemented to assess the effect of the procedures (sample instruments are appended). It was found that the group/team advising method resulted in considerable lower average advising time than traditional one-to-one advising. For student satisfaction or knowledge of policies no significant differences were found between the group/team advising method and the one-to-one advising method. The group method saved 14 minutes per student, and assuming an average faculty advising load of 45 students, the group approach saved a typical advisor more than 10 hours during a registration period. Given three such  registrations periods during the year, projected time savings generated over 30 hours for the average advisor. A bibliography is appended. (SW)",

        "description":"Legal methods and related case law that can be used by public higher education administrators to deal with intrusions by outsiders onto the campus are examined. The following legal factors related to control of campus access are addressed: risk management, police power, general trespass, school related trespass/loitering statutes, First and Fourteenth Amendment Issues, and the injunction. Part of the risk appraisal process is reviewing the realities, dangers, and liabilities of community access to public college and university campuses. Another process of the risk management concept is the inventory and subsequent development of means or countermeasures that can be focused on the appraised risks. Most of the rationale for protection of the campus is based on the statutory and  constitutional authority of the state to protect the health, welfare, and safety of its citizens. The use of criminal trespass statutes in enforcing problems on campuses has met with varying successes. Most attacks, through litigation and judicial review, on cases of criminal trespass have been based on the grounds of lack of specificity of statutes. The First Amendment is the greatest operating doctrine affecting the issue of access control to public campuses. Seven suggestions for administrators are discussed: (1) practice risk management; (2) make effective use of counsel; (3) incorporate the attorney into the management team; (4) utilize a variety of legal resources; (5) examine significant legal decisions and issues related to campus access; (6) ensure counsel in using effective  internal management practices; and (7) examine alternate models for legal service delivery.

Graduate study must be nurtured, and cannot ever be the sole preoccupation of academe. Today the crucial balance of things and humans is threatened by the erosion of support for and interest in graduate study of the humanities. The professions, such as medicine, are turning more and more to the humanities as part of professional study, seeking three things the humanities can uniquely contribute to human endeavor: (1) to serve as preferred vehicles for teaching the liberal arts; (2) to provide sources of knowledge not susceptible to scientific method; and (3) to enrich the lives of humans as humans. It is important  to reassert these seemingly obvious uses of the humanities, even for the humanists. The liberal arts are indispensable to the survival of democratic societies, which survive on the strength of their citizens who possess a critical intelligence. As a result of changes external and internal to the humanities, humanists have retreated too swiftly before the popularity and successes of the sciences and the professions. Scholarship and research do not exhaust the value of the humanities to society, and it is the university's responsibility to prepare humanists who can cultivate the closer engagement of the humanities with practical affairs.

The West as a region is considered in relation to land and population, urban growth, energy impact, and the states' role. Higher education can help in the areas of manpower, research, and public service. Economic expansion is dependent on the supply of trained manpower, and high technology manufacturing and energy development are two industries that are pacing western economic growth but need increased manpower supply. To meet the challenges of balanced economic growth, people with specialized, multidisciplinary training in economic development will be needed to provide the leadership and management capabilities  for both the public and private sectors. A special facet of the need for economic development professional manpower is the need to improve access into the field for the region's minorities. Colleges and universities can help the situation by better manpower planning and by closer cooperation between higher education and industry in planning. The scientific and technical research role of universities has particular relevance to international trade, agriculture, and water issues. Public service roles universities can provide are: information on trends, policy research, and technical assistance. Attention is directed to institutional barriers to providing public services, faculty incentives, funding issues, coordination and communication, organizational structures, and formal linkages.

Additionally, factors producing serious state and local budgetary problems are identified, including the low rate of economic growth, tax policy, and the link between state-local income tax regulations and federal income tax rules. For the SREB states, information is presented on: per pupil expenditure for elementary and secondary education; per capita appropriations for higher education; and state appropriations for higher educational operations as a percent of state taxes ranked against state and local support of  elementary and secondary education. States that rank among the highest in their tax contribution to higher education are lowest in support of elementary and secondary schools. In 1980, state and local taxes collected in the United States per $1,000 of personal income amounted to $110.75. Major tax sources (general sales, selective sales, property, individual income, and corporation income) are compared to the 14 SREB States and for the other regions aggregately. For 1980-81, tax and spending reduction were somewhat more common than tax increases. Among the SREB states, inflation-adjusted declines in higher education funding were especially serious in Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, and South Carolina. The declines occur at a time of reduced federal support. On a per capita basis, seven SREB  states are above the average in support of higher education: Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. Maryland is the only SREB state that exceeds the national average in support of elementary and secondary education. (SW)",

        "description":"Trends in computing and office automation and their applications, including planning, institutional research, and general administrative support in higher education, are discussed. Changing aspects of information processing and an increasingly larger user community are considered. The computing literacy cycle may involve programming, analysis, use of report or query languages, and use of home or office computers. Computing and computing literacy programs already exist in preschools, elementary schools, and secondary schools, as well as colleges and universities. Applications include programmed instruction, drill and practice, dialogue with computers, modeling and simulation, and instruction in computer programming. Attention is directed to technological solutions to office  problems, access to academic computing facilities, the need to consider the availability of appropriate personnel before selecting a service model, and the nature of technology and technological change. Three service models for computing services are considered: completely centralized, distributed, and external. Institutional researchers who become involved in distributed computing will probably become involved in the problems of common data element definitions, documentation, software development, standards, and communications. The extent to which technology will affect the services and institutional researchers depends on the nature of the researcher's activities. Data collection and maintenance, for example, should probably be centralized if many departments are involved or distributed  if only a single department is involved. Some resource materials on technological developments are briefly described; and a bibliography is appended. (SW)",

        "description":"Academic progress requirements of federally funded student aid programs administered by the Department of Education (ED), the Veterans Administration (VA), and the Social Security Administration (SSA) were investigated. Eighteen public and private two-year and four-year colleges, as well as one public vocational school and one proprietary school, were visited, and more than 5,800 randomly selected student transcripts were reviewed. It was found that many students receiving financial aid were not making satisfactory progress. Mainly this resulted from school standards that allowed students to remain eligible for aid without proving that they were moving toward a definite goal with adequate grades and at a reasonable rate. Some of the institutions were not even enforcing their own  standards. For the schools that had not enforced their standards for ED aid recipients, overpayments were estimated to about $1.28 million. It is concluded that weak and nonspecific federal requirements on academic progress have led to abuse of the student aid programs, particularly those administered by the ED and SSA. It is suggested that ED and SSA requirements should be essentially the same as those set by the VA. It is proposed that regulations are needed that specify that an institution establish, publish, and enforce academic progress standards for students receiving aid. The standards should address the movement toward graduation at a reasonable rate and with adequate grades, and limitations on excessive withdrawals and courses that do not count toward graduation or program  completion. Additional recommendations to Congress and the federal agencies are included. (SW)",

        "description":"An alternative approach to achieve short-time enrollment stabilization based in part on experiences at the State University of New York, Geneseo, is described. It is suggested that a short-range effort will not be enough to assure institutional vitality in the difficult years ahead. Short-range stabilization should be followed by the integration of enrollment decision-making with campus governance. Among the programs implemented in 1977-78 at the university are the following: an admissions internship program, adjunct recruiter program, student volunteer admissions program, alumni volunteer admissions program, communications program, and departmental liaison program. A mailing program was designed so that each applicant received something from the college every week, including  information on housing, a financial aids brochure, special edition of the student newspaper, and a career planning brochure. In 1978 and 1979, increased acceptances of admission offers occurred, and the quality of the freshman class climbed. The most important by-product of short-range stabilization is the development of a comprehensive management information system on enrollment. However, recruiting and retention decision-making continued to be largely a peripheral matter insofar as campus governance was concerned. Efforts to integrate it through liaison systems, diverse committee memberships, and continuous communication were only partially successful. Structural changes designed to integrate enrollment decision-making with campus governance are outlined. (SW)",

        "description":"The validity of American College Testing (ACT) scores and self-reported high school grades in predicting college freshman grade average is documented, and the accuracy of prediction equations based on these measures is reported for institutions of differing freshman class size, affiliation, degree level, and racial/ethnic composition. Results are based on data collected from a random sample of 205 colleges that participated in the ACT Research Services in 1974-75 and 1976-77, with a separate prediction equation calculated for each college from its 1974-75 data. The predictive validity of ACT scores and high school grades was weakly related to freshman class size of more than 90. Prediction accuracy was moderately related to the institutional characteristics of affiliation, degree  level, and racial/ethnic composition. Among the total college group, the accuracy of separate-sex predictions was less strongly related to freshman class size than to other institutional characteristics studied. However, it was more strongly related to freshman class size at private and four-year institutions than other kinds of institutions. Combined-sex equations based on simple random samples of size 50 from the base year data were almost as accurate as equations based on all records from the colleges, suggesting that ACT data could be used to make predictions of acceptable accuracy at colleges with as few as 50 freshmen.

A brief summary of the research related to organizational information processing and climate is followed by a suggested research design to study information processing and climate in academic and public libraries. Following the specific hypotheses for the project, the paper concludes by noting that such research will assist investigators to identify organizational climate contingencies where information variables are maximized/minimized, to describe the effect of various informational processing variables on specific aspects of organizational climate, and to develop models to predict the  effect of information processing and organizational climate on overall organizational effectiveness.

A discussion of selected concepts from cognitive science and artificial intelligence describes their use as models for characterizing the research process or to specify procedural requirements for the system. Applications of these concepts in two manual &quot;simulations&quot; of the diagnostic process are described, including the research project as a procedural script  (illustrated with scripts in microbiology and industrial psychology), the researcher as a problem solver, the diagnostic system as a problem solver, and the researcher's knowledge needs as schemata/frames. A 7-step process is described which is designed to successively narrow and define the researcher's current problem and his knowledge surrounding that problem, thus providing a basis for developing a search strategy, selecting relevant knowledge, and developing information products to fill knowledge gaps. Fifteen references are listed, and appendices provide examples of knowledge schemata. (RAA)",

After tracing the history of Feather River College (FRC) and movements to disassociate the college with the PCCD, the report describes the FRC Advisory Board and its interaction with the PCCD Board of Trustees. Areas of concern and dissatisfaction with the present district organization are examined prior to a discussion of the legal considerations involved in district reorganization. Decisions required by  the PCCD Board of Trustees in the event of reorganization are cited, followed by enumerations of problems associated with the operation of a small college district and with a multicollege district. Finally, community reactions to the reorganization are summarized. Part II begins with population and financial projections, and then considers the funding implications of district reorganization. Next, detailed analyses are presented for 29 reorganization alternatives. Extensive appendices include analyses of special problems, discussions of the possibilities of operating FRC as a college center or as part of the Plumas Unified School District, and other related materials.

        "description":"In the past management information systems (MIS) have focused on data relating to the internal operations of the institution (e.g., registration and space utilization). Recently, however, strategic planning as a means of establishing long-range goals is becoming increasingly dependent upon data external to the institution, such as demographics and social and economic factors. Strategic planning requires an MIS capable of monitoring social changes, assessing institutional strengths, and integrating internal and external data. The tools of strategic planning include needs assessment, trend analysis, environmental scanning, and market analysis. These tools may be used by institutions at various stages of development (i.e., emergence, growth, development, regeneration, and decline)  and in a variety of operational modes (i.e., hierarchical, collegial, and collective bargaining). The purpose of the MIS function is to gain insights into which of several options an institution will choose over a several year period. Technology transfer is an excellent example of a public service function requiring strategic planning. In Ohio, the use of strategic planning in this area is illustrated by the efforts of the Ohio Technology Transfer Organization, an information/assistance network for small businesses and industries sponsored by Ohio State University and Ohio's two-year colleges. (Appendices provide data tables and survey instruments useful to strategic planning.) (Author/KL)",

First, the community college's contribution to and position in American higher education is examined, especially with respect to enrollment and curricular trends. Next, the results of a national study of community college science education and a study of science programs in the Los Angeles Community College District are highlighted to provide an overview of two-year science education. This overview provides information on: (1) enrollment trends; (2) course levels; (3) course completion ratios; (4) students' reasons for taking science; (5) grades as predictors of future success; (6) the availability of student support services and students' use of them; (7) instructors'  perceptions of their students' abilities; and (8) instructors' perceptions of their needs to improve their courses. Drawing upon these findings and upon the literature on community college science programs, the report then presents several conclusions about two-year science education and offers recommendations for the future. These recommendations call for offering courses through community services; more short-term, laboratory experience courses for career students; more remedial science preparatory courses; the required use of support services by students; and the establishment of a national exchange to disseminate information on two-year science education.

        "description":"In January-February 1980, all students who were enrolled in an occupational program at an Illinois community college during 1979 and who completed all of the required skills courses but did not graduate with a degree or certificate were surveyed to determine how well the colleges were meeting the needs of these students. Survey questionnaires solicited information on: (1) satisfaction with community college services; (2) impact of college attendance on students; (3) degree of success in achieving goals; (4) plans for further education; (5) employment status, location, responsibilities, and salary; (6) job satisfaction and relation of job to college program; and (7) college help in job placement. Of the 893 students surveyed, 412 (46.1%) responded. The study revealed that library  services, veteran's services, instruction, and financial aid were rated favorably, while job placement and career counseling received the lowest ratings. Most respondents felt that a community college education was helpful in developing critical thinking, communication skills, and life goals and values. Over 62% of the respondents were employed full-time, and another 15.7% were employed part-time. Of the employed respondents, 57% were working in a field related to their major and 74% were satisfied with their work. Full-time employees earned a median salary of $1,113 per month. The study report summarizes follow-up data by program area and includes the questionnaire. (Author/KL)",

First, concerns about student illiteracy, lack of academic preparation, and failure to complete courses are discussed, and public demands for educational accountability are examined. Next, the relationship between the &quot;open door&quot; concept and the increased need for basic skills instruction is explored, with special reference to the needs of Black and Hispanic students. After defining basic skills, the paper summarizes arguments for and against their inclusion in the community college curriculum. The paper then outlines the major characteristics of two model programs of basic skills instruction. The first is the Coordinated Bilingual Bicultural Studies Program at  Laredo Junior College, an interdisciplinary program involving history, English, reading, human development, psychology and Spanish along with counseling and evaluation components. The second is the Ford Foundation sponsored Math Intervention Project for Hispanic Students, conducted by the Border College Consortium, which includes faculty, counselors, parents and peers in efforts to acclimate Hispanics to mathematics and science fields. These programs are described in terms of their curricula, objectives, activities, and program evaluation. (KL)",

Over 200 people participated in these discussions, and testimony was taken from educators, administrators, students, community members, business people, and other interested parties. This report provides transcripts of the public testimony arranged chronologically and by place. The testimony provides a variety of comments concerning college governance structure, community college mission, community college responsiveness to needs, the use of policy advisory councils, tuition, and other issues. Several themes emerge from the transcripts: (1) there was  widespread opinion that there is inequitable funding to the detriment of the community colleges; (2) there was dissatisfaction with the community colleges' ability to provide courses and programs requested by their constituencies and to provide adequate outreach programs; (3) there was a perceived need for more flexibility of educational delivery modes; (4) significant problems were perceived in the transfer of credits from the community colleges to the universities; (5) the colleges' policy advisory councils were seen as serving an important function; and (6) the primary thrust of the community college was seen as offering vocational-technical courses.

After introductory material, the summary results of the study are presented under eight categories: (1) full-time equivalent (FTE) teacher compensation per fiscal-year equated (FYE) student (i.e., a hypothetical student enrolled for 34 credit hours per fiscal year); (2) FTE students per FTE teacher; (3) compensation per FTE teacher; (4) student/teacher ratio and percentage distribution of teachers; (5) total direct instructional cost per FYE student; (6) full cost per FYE student; (7) costs per FYE student per component (e.g., student services and administration); and (8) percentage distribution of FY 1981 expenditures. Next, the overall summary of the  study outlines general findings, including the following: vocational education is not necessarily more expensive than general education in Alaska's community colleges; there is a strong relationship between the number of FYE students enrolled and direct instructional cost per FYE student; and the community colleges in Alaska spend their money in different ways and experience different costs per FYE student. Extensive tables and appended material illustrate findings; provide a breakdown of statistics by college; and present the study methodology, college profiles, and courses offered. (HB)",

Using this model, a simulation was conducted to predict the enrollment and revenue effects of a $50 annual fee increase at California community colleges. The simulation, based on Reagan administration proposals to reduce appropriations to the Basic Educational Opportunity Grants (BEOG) program, utilized four assumptions: (1) a $50 annual registration fee for students enrolling for six hours or more per semester and a $30 registration fee for those enrolling for less than six hours; (2) additional state financial aid for BEOG-eligible students to cover the amount of fee  increases; (3) state general fund declines of $1,275 per ADA (Average Daily Attendance) for enrollment losses; and (4) May 1981 proposals for BEOG program cuts. Projections from the simulation indicate that the community colleges would lose 31,041 students (i.e., 2.5% of all students) with a fee increase of this magnitude; that 26,086 of the students would be enrolled for less than six units and would not be eligible for student aid; that few low-income students enrolled for more than six units would fail to attend because of the registration fee, but that 15,208 low-income students enrolled for six units or less would probably not enroll.

First, six tables present statistics on: (1) fall semester enrollment broken down according to day/evening status, sex, full-/part-time status, freshman/sophomore status, first-time/continuing status, age, and ethnic groups; (2) admissions classifications of LACC students (i.e., first-time freshmen, first-time transfers, returning transfers, returning students, and continuing students); (3-5) LACC new enrollments according to public and private feeder high schools; and (6) first-time transfers to LACC from foreign countries. Next, ten graphs are provided to illustrate trends revealed in these data. Finally, observations on the  findings are presented. Total enrollment over the ten-year period varied less than 5% from the average if the years 1974 and 1975 are omitted. Females outnumbered males in all years except 1974 and 1977, with the percentage of females peaking at 55% in 1977. Ethnic distributions have changed significantly over the period, with a sharp decrease in White enrollments (from 38% in 1972 to 22% in 1981) and steady increases in Hispanic and Asian enrollments. Median age has (with the exception of 1974 and 1975) increased steadily from 24 to 26 years of age.

Structured interviews were conducted with 28 instructors who provided information on personal background; course planning and organization; positive regard for students; use of teaching strategies to foster student participation; and degree and type of feedback, correction, and reinforcement given to  students. The study revealed that these exemplary teachers shared many common teaching characteristics and instructional practices, regardless of their academic discipline, age, or experience. Effective teachers were generally well organized and very systematic in their teaching. Although they used primarily whole-group instruction, the teachers emphasized student participation in class. These teachers provided regular and specific feedback on student learning progress and had a high positive regard for their students, which they communicated by learning students' names and encouraging individual conferences.

Responses were received from 639 of the 1,231 colleges surveyed; 90% were public colleges. The study revealed that: (1) 72% of the CEO's had a contract; (2) contract terms ranged from one to five years, with 26% being for one year; (3) 40.5% of the contracts provided for annual review; (4) only 2% of the contracts specified the basic duties of the CEO; and (5) 8% provided for evaluation. The mean salary of CEO's was $48,402.09, and a clear relationship was revealed between enrollment and salary. With regard to other benefits, 25% of the colleges provided a home or housing  allowance; 61.2% offered health benefits; 43% provided family tuition benefits; 71% paid a travel allowance; and 70% offered life insurance. The mean benefits of CEO's amounted to $13,258. The study report considers findings in terms of regional and institutional size differences.

        "description":"Between 1976 and 1979, Head Start, as part of its strategy for Spanish-speaking children, funded four institutions for the purpose of developing and implementing four distinct bilingual bicultural preschool curriculum models for use with Spanish-speaking children. In 1977, the Research, Demonstration, and Evaluation Division of the Administration for Children, Youth, and Families commissioned Juarez and Associates Inc. to conduct an evaluation of the Head Start Bilingual Bicultural Curriculum Development Project. The study, which was conducted over a 3 1/2-year period in eight Head Start centers in communities with relatively large Hispanic populations, focused on the impact of the four bilingual bicultural preschool curriculum models on the children, their parents, and their  teachers. This document provides an executive summary of the study's evaluation design, the findings of the study, and the implications of these findings. (Author/MP)",

To assess this assumption, samples of teacher education preservice candidates, educational foundations faculty, liberal arts and sciences faculty and school teachers were asked to complete a survey questionnaire designed to elicit their ratings of teacher educators on six dimensions of reputation. The dimensions of reputation studied were credibility, knowledgeability in their specialty, general knowledgeability, effectiveness as teachers, status, and orientation to knowledge and research. Additional questionnaire items were developed to obtain information concerning the extent to which teacher educators are seen to be realistic  versus idealistic.

A transcript for discourse analysis was obtained by recording on tape 19 minutes of a group reading session that included frequent interruptions resulting in brief discussions. Several analyses were performed on the questions of both the teacher and the children as well as on the topics raised by each. These analyses included marking utterance and topic boundaries, categorizing questions and topics in terms of type and function, and determining the interaction between question type  and function. Further analyses were performed to consider how children and teachers might initiate topics through questions. Results reveal differences between discourse in a group learning situation and in normal everyday conversation. The conclusion drawn is that certain rules of conversation do not apply in the classroom, particularly with regard to the teacher's questions and remarks. Notation used for the transcription and data from the analysis of topical structure are appended. (Author/RH)",

Following an introductory overview (Chapter 1) of the evaluation's phases and objectives, Chapter II describes the methodology of the pilot study which provided exploratory data on the evaluation instruments intended for use in Phases II and III. The design of the pilot study, as well as the instruments  and the site selection and sampling methods used in the study are also described. The descriptive analysis of the nine experimental and five control sites involved in the pilot study is given in Chapter III. Each site is described in terms of the demographic characteristics of the community and its Head Start program, as well as the development, structure, administration, coordination, major goals, objectives, activities, support system/resources, and evaluation of the CFMH Project.

Are exclusively center-based developmental programs for preschool children to be discredited? Should federally-sponsored intervention programs insist on parent participation? If so, what specific form should parent participation assume? To answer these and similar questions about parent education, a group of academicians and educators at the University of North Carolina -- all with extensive backgrounds in various aspects of parent education -- proposed to sponsor a conference of leading scholars and practitioners with expertise in the areas of parent education, preschool intervention, and social  policy decision-making. The purpose of this report is to summarize the 1980 conference on &quot;Parent Education and Public Policy.&quot; The report is divided into six sections: (1) background of the conference; (2) conference proceedings; (3) policy recommendations from conference work groups; (4) themes emerging from the conference; (5) outline of a book that will result from the conference; and (6) reflections on planning and conducting conferences addressed to issues of public policy.

The groupings were further subdivided by sex in order to account for the effect of each child's sex on the relationship between child-rearing and achievement in the different groupings. Information on child-rearing, as well as on parental occupations (used to determine the social class levels) was obtained from 1,102 mothers by means of survey interviews. Children's scholastic achievement was measured on standard school achievement  tests taken from school records. Results, while providing support for the above general proposition, provided only partial support for two specific hypotheses proposing that urban black mothers of high achievers use warm and restrictive strategies, and that white middle-class mothers of high achievers use warm and non-restrictive strategies. The effect of the child's sex on maternal child-rearing strategies are discussed. (Author/MP)",

Following an introductory overview (Chapter I) of the study's objectives and its theoretical framework, Chapter II provides an overview of the sample design and its demographic characteristics, specifies variables, and describes models and methods used for the analysis of data. An array of findings, beginning with mothers' perceptions of their children and then linking these perceptions to their views of extra-familial influences are presented in Chapters III and IV respectively. Chapter V examines the contours of work and  family arrangements as they are perceived by a sample of white married women, employed in part- and full-time jobs. Chapter VI addresses questions about how parents view and evaluate their neighborhoods and about ways different neighborhood ecologies contribute to and inhibit parents' and children's activities. In Chapter VII social network data as informal systems of social support are discussed, and then linked in Chapter VIII with mothers' perceptions of themselves, their children, and (if married) their husbands. Finally, the implications of study findings for evaluation of program effects are presented in Chapter IX. A detailed description of the methods used to select families and neighborhoods for the study, as well as descriptive profiles of each neighborhood selected are included  in the appendices.

The document also provides a  matrix of the 23 topics discussed across the 50 papers and across the five areas of concern for children and youth. Many of the papers cut across topics and areas: thus, for example, family structure is examined in the areas of health, social services, education, legal issues, and economic issues. More specific topics, such as child abuse or teenage parents, can be found in an appended list of papers. Lists of agencies participating in the panels and research forum participants are also appended. (Author/RH)",

Points of controversy concerning bilingual education are pointed out and three philosophical approaches to, or models for, bilingual education are briefly described. The view of critics who see bilingual education as educationally unsound are mentioned and data about the educational experience of culturally diverse populations in the United States are introduced as part of an argument that a return to past practices requiring cultural assimilation is not a justifiable policy. It is further argued that such traditional educational practices violate basic American principles of freedom and human rights. Research findings countering the view that bilingualism is an outward sign of poor  intellectual functioning are cited. Additional studies, indicating the positive outcomes of bilingual abilities and programs, are cited and briefly described, and it is concluded that the growth of the Hispanic population necessitates the attainment of some semblance of equal educational opportunity.

        "description":"Premature birth (defined as delivery before 37 weeks gestation) and low birthweight (below 2,500 grams) are major health problems in the United States. Infants in these categories account for 75 per cent of neonatal deaths and 50 per cent of deaths in the first year of life. Survivors contribute disproportionately to the pool of handicapped children who require rehabilitative care and may never be competitive individuals. Research advances and the availability of perinatal intensive care have resulted in vastly improved survival in the past decade. The weight at which roughly half the babies survive has dropped from 1300 to about 800 grams. Better care also has been associated with a better quality of life for the survivors. The vast majority of prematures greater than 1000 grams  birthweight can be expected to survive, and mean IQ values of premature infants at this weight approach those of the general population. The group below 1000 grams birthweight does not participate fully in this improved prognosis. Below 750 grams, less than half survive, and a considerable number of the survivors have serious health problems. (In conclusion, 10 research areas are identified in which progress is desired.)

        "description":"This report discusses the magnitude of the problem of birth defects, outlines advances in the birth defects field in the past decade, and identifies those areas where research is needed for the prevention, treatment, and management of birth defects. The problem of birth defects has consumed a greater portion of our health care resources because of the reduction of infectious diseases and our ability to salvage and care for many malformed children. These health care costs are estimated conservatively at $20 billion per year. For every 1000 live births, 130 have genetic or anatomical defects. A genetic etiology accounts for 25 per cent of anatomical defects. The largest group of defects (65 per cent) is believed to be polygenic or multifactorial in origin. Contrary to the notion  that the main causes of birth defects are environmental agents such as drugs, chemical, and/or ionizing radiation, information gathered in the last 20 years indicates that these environmental agents account for only 10 per cent of birth defects. During the past decade, a greater prevention of birth defects has resulted from epidemiologic surveillance, better management of maternal medical disorders and obstetric and neonatal factors, greater understanding of the role of environmental factors and genetic diseases, insights obtained from psychosocial observations, and legal and ethical opinions. However, although much has been achieved during the last decade, many areas still need to be investigated. The improved management of maternal disease states and the development of vaccines or  effective treatment of intrauterine infections are areas for maximal investment of future resources.

Very possibly, the assumptions upon which food supplement programs are based are ill-founded. While many of the currently operating broadly conceived supplemental food programs achieve desirable collateral benefits, they may prove to be stop-gap measures that are less important than other steps that should be taken to ensure the health, well-being and future social competence of children and youth. To establish a sound basis for food policy, further research on nutrition is needed (or will continue) in several areas, including (1) the effects of adult obesity on health; (2) the contribution of infant obesity to adult obesity; (3) the role of diet  in the genesis of degenerative vascular diseases; (4) the potential role of specific foods, food components and food additives in the etiology of various malignancies; (5) the need for trace minerals in the diet; (6) the identification of normal mechanisms of intestinal absorption and the role of gastrointestinal flora; (7) cell-mediated immunity; (8) the advantages and risks of breast feeding; and (9) the influence of nutrition on hyperactivity.

The consequences of teenage pregnancy for the parents, the child, the family of origin, and the economic consequences for society are delineated. The discussion of research needs emphasizes primary prevention through effective contraceptives that are designed for and acceptable to teenagers; sex education that includes  information on the nature of sexuality, risks of pregnancy and the costs and burdens of premature parenthood; and increased attention to the value of virginity. Research needs related to unresolved questions in the area of secondary prevention, research needed to improve longer-range outcomes for the children of teenagers, and the need for the evaluation of preventive and intervention programs are indicated.

It is concluded that reports on the physical, social, emotional, and cognitive-developmental consequences of child abuse present an impression of serious and profound pathology in the victims, but that analysis of these studies demonstrates major methodological flaws that limit their generalizability, scientific validity, and utility for building theory and for guiding practice. The second section of the paper discusses the importance of theory to knowledge, prevention, and treatment of child abuse. An account of the  development of child abuse research is provided. The account describes the shift in research objectives from a set of unitary theories to a set of integrative hypotheses -- a shift from a search for a single cause of child abuse to the identification of individual differences in etiology.

Thereafter, discussion focuses on the contemporary approach to neuropsychiatric disorders of childhood as exemplified by three serious disturbances: attention deficit disorders, autism, and Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome of chronic multiple tics. Central processing or cognitive difficulties, attentional and activity regulation, personal/social/motivational disturbances, individual assessment, and treatment related to attention deficit disorders are described. The discussion then moves to delineate the characteristics of autism in the early and later years of childhood, as well as the causes  and treatment of autism, and prospects for increased understanding of autism in the future. The discussion of Tourette's Syndrome focuses on the nature, causes, and treatment of the disorder. In a concluding overview, it is indicated that perhaps the predominant characteristic of the past several years of clinical investigation of neuropsychiatric disorders of childhood is a steady progression of knowledge and recognition of the complexity and interrelationships of developmental disorders.

        "description":"Injuries are the leading causes of death for non-infant children and adolescents. Motor vehicles, drownings, fires, firearms, and poisons, in that order, are the major categories of fatal injury for the child population as a whole. Recognition that the agents of injury are the major forms of energy (mechanical, thermal, chemical) has led to an increased focus on the characteristics of energy and factors in children's environments that increase exposure to these agents. A wide range of strategies is available to modify such agents and environments. These strategies would reduce the incidence and severity of injuries, including prevention of creation or release of the agents; separation of the agents from children in time, space, or with physical barriers; and modification of  qualities of agents, vehicles and hosts. Research relevant to choice of strategies suggest that changes in injurious agents or environments that do not require modification in behavior of those at risk are usually the most effective and less often generate objections from the general public. However, resistance to regulation on economic, political, and ideological grounds may delay or foreclose the use of a given strategy. Therefore, attempts at injury control should be researched in relatively small-scale experiments before being adopted on a large scale. Such experiments could rule out the programs that have unanticipated harmful effects or no effects, and give more credence in the economic, social and political arenas to those programs that are effective.

Subjects for the study were 25 males and 25 females between the ages of 24 and 30 months who were members of low-income families whose day care fees were paid by Title XX funds. APPROACH (A Procedure for Patterning Responses Of Adults and CHildren), a fine-grained ecological technique for observing and coding child interactions with peers, objects, and caregivers was used to record 80 minutes of behavior per child. From the APPROACH records, children's communication and interaction attempts with  teachers were coded into one and only one of the following five categories: seeking help, requesting attention, distressed or negative approach to teacher, positive approach, and attempt to seek information. Teacher responses to toddler communication attempts were coded into one and only one of the following nine categories: ego boosts, teaching, questions, attends, combinations of positive with control or negative responses, commands, negative responses, ignores, and unknown. Findings concerning teachers' responsiveness to seeking help, requests for attention, distress/negative bids, positive bids, and seeking information are discussed in detail and implications for caregiver training are drawn.

        "description":"This paper reports a cross-sectional, developmental study of the fluidity of children's mental functioning (representational skills) in contexts involving the representational use of blocks. Data were collected from a sample of 40 children from a laboratory school: 20 four-year-olds and 20 seven-year-olds, with an equal number of boys and girls in each group. Each child was taken to an experimental room and was invited to play with a set of table-top building blocks while answering questions about prior experience with block play. After returning the blocks to their box, the child was directed to listen closely to the story of &quot;Little Red Cap.&quot; Subsequently, the child was told to use the blocks to represent the story. Children's block construction behavior was videotaped. Upon  completion of the construction task, the child was asked to describe in detail what the blocks showed. The children's descriptions were recorded and photos of all block representations were taken. If the judges determined that the first-placed block appeared to be reoriented in space in the course of construction, they categorized the child as &quot;fluid.&quot; Initial analyses indicated that four-year-olds' constructions were more frequently &quot;fluid&quot; than were seven-year-olds' constructions. Among four-year-olds only, sex differences were found. Boys' constructions were more fluid than girls'. Post hoc analysis revealed that most reorientations or fluid constructions were due to blocks falling. Results are discussed. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"The purpose of the present study was to determine whether temperament differences exist between infants who completed a visual perceptual/cognitive experiment and those who did not. A total of 14 Caucasian infants ranging in age from 5-15 months participated in the study. The subjects were placed in one of two groups (completers vs. noncompleters) based upon their performance at four months of age in a visual habituation experiment. Infants were classified as noncompleters if they had fussed, cried or fallen asleep two or more times during the test session and could not be coaxed into a more attentive state (i.e., to be visually alert, motorically inactive). Additional information on the infants' behavior patterns was obtained from their mothers who were asked to complete the  Infant Temperament Questionnaire Revised (ITQR). Based upon personal observation and parental comments from previous investigations it was predicted that the subjects in the completers group would tend to be classified as easy or intermediate in temperament whereas the noncompleters group would generally be labeled as difficult or slow to warm up. In general, results supported this prediction. In comparison to the completers, the noncompleters were found to be more motorically active, withdrawing, and negative in mood. The findings were discussed in terms of the questionable external validity of most infant perceptual/cognitive investigations. (Author/MP)",

Mothers and infants observed in dyadic interaction in a playroom during a 15-minute free play period represented a heterogeneous sample across gender, socioeconomic status, and birth order. Interactions were recorded on checklists which contained 18 infant and 18 maternal behaviors. The observed behaviors are listed in the text. Two factor analyses were performed at each age level: one for the infants' behavior and one for the mothers' behavior. Subsequently, an oblique factor rotation with a delta value of zero was employed to determine unique dimensions of social behaviors while allowing for the identification  of overlap between dimensions. Rotated factor solutions were examined and factors were identified using criterion levels of eigenvalues, loadings, and communality. After a specified number of factors had been determined to be most psychometrically and theoretically useful, the factor analyses were conducted a second time. Results are discussed. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Although both desegregation and bilingual education ideally aim at the goal of equal and equitable educational opportunities for minority youngsters, the initial impetus of bilingual education differs distinctly from desegregation in that the bilingual approach requires separate special treatment. The degree of divergence between desegregation and bilingual education must be considered and determined in light of the limited resources and competing priorities of each case. In Hartford, Connecticut, concentrations of Puerto Rican and black students constitute a virtual unanimity in certain schools and a clear majority in the city. Puerto Rican pupils suffer more severe disparities than black students with respect to verbal academic achievement, educational enrollment, and  self-concept. Poverty of Puerto Ricans results in overcrowded housing and ill health. In 1970-72, the Hartford School System instituted a pilot bilingual program which has evolved into a complete bilingual elementary school, including bilingual classes from preschool to sixth grade, a bilingual special education resource center, and a staff development program which extends to other schools in the city. The Hartford system begun to develop a policy statement, assess parent involvement, and develop a testing and evaluation design. Because both desegregation and bilingual education are crucial to minority students, when and how to implement each remedy must be carefully considered. (CM)",

Participants agreed that identification of problems and efforts to solve them should be initiated by those involved in and affected by the local education program, not by outside experts. The second conference explored the participants' experiences with a variety of programs designed to improve education in rural settings. Capacity building strategies derived from experiences related in the conference  included: collaborative problem solving; community organization; regional information exchange and referral service; inter-agency coordination; associations of users; networking; and leadership development. School administrators and education decision makers added perspectives on rural school improvement in the third conference, identified critical elements that should be part of any strategy (community involvement, leadership development, and networking), and asserted that because rural settings are so varied, it may be more difficult to generalize across rural settings than across urban ones.

The underlying goal for all decisions should be to arrange a permanent home where the child can develop tribal identity. Placement decisions must be based on the assessment of the child, parents, extended family, tribe, emotional attachments between each person involved, and the benefits of returning a child to his/her tribe. After completion of the needed assessments, placement options should be identified: return child to parents; leave child with foster parents; adoption by extended family, tribal member, Indian parents of different tribe, or foster parent; or place  child with foster parents of another tribe. The role of the judge, social service worker, child, family, and community needs to be clear. When implementing a decision the following should be considered: preparation of the child and family for the child's move, mechanics of placement (e.g., the child's sense of time, nature of visits), stages of adjustment, and various post-placement resources and services. After implementation of a decision, the placement must be monitored so that services can be offered if problems develop. (NQA)",

Past events provide evidence that legislation, policies, and local resolutions that require science textbooks and curricula to include the Genesis account of creation are unconstitutional. Now, scientific creationism, rather than biblical creationism, is being promoted to neutralize the study of evolutionary theory. However, even the proponents of creationism admit that creation science is not scientific when they say it lies beyond the limits of empirical science, it does not provide a testable scientific theory, and it cannot be disproved. To counter the argument that creationism is religious, the  creationists claim that evolutionary theory is religious theory and is an important tenet of secular humanism which they term the religion of the modern age. While the courts have affirmed the right of schools to include evolution in the curriculum without such instruction constituting coercion against religious exercise, questions of academic freedom if creationism is or is not taught have not been resolved.

Change through time (evolution) was one of the BSCS conceptual themes. Its incorporation into high school biology textbooks resulted in textbooks containing material on evolution that was not confined to the last chapter (which might never be reached during the school year). Efforts of the anti-evolutionists have resulted in changes in textbooks produced in  the early 1980's in which controversy is avoided by de-emphasis on evolution or on the exclusion of the word from the textbook although natural selection and related topics are included. Creationism, the author contends, has failed to compete in the scientific and theological worlds of scholarship and its perpetuation in public school curricula should not be used to impose religious views on students.

Seventy-seven students in two junior high school mathematics classrooms learned a two-week unit on exponents and scientific notation in mixed-ability or uniform-ability groups. Interaction in the groups was tape recorded. Three categories of interaction related to achievement: receiving no explanation in response to a question or error (receiving no response or receiving only the correct answer) was negatively related to achievement; giving explanations and receiving explanations were positively related to achievement. Interaction in the group was related to group composition, sex, ability, and personality. Medium-ability students in  uniform-ability groups received more explanations (and showed higher achievement) than medium-ability students in mixed ability groups. Boys received more explanations (and showed higher achievement) than girls. High-ability students gave more explanations than low-ability students. Extroverted students received more answers to questions than introverted students. Interaction in the group was not related to ethnic background: white, black, and Asian-American students showed similar interaction patterns (and achievement). The advantages of taperecording over other observational procedures are discussed in terms of capturing sequences of student interaction. (Author/MP)",

        "description":"The data reported were obtained from two investigations carried out by the Australian Council for Educational Research in 1964 and in 1978. Each study was conducted at two levels of the secondary school. A subset of the 1978 samples is considered, which comprises students in government-only schools, so that effective comparisons can be made. Among the findings, it is noted there have not been substantial gains in the average level of achievement in mathematics learning of girls relative to boys over the 14-year period between the tests. Nevertheless, there is a marked change noted over these same years in the degree of involvement and participation by girls in learning mathematics at the upper secondary school level. Movement towards greater equality between the sexes appears to  have taken place during the period. When other things which influence achievement in mathematics are taken into account, group sex differences in achievement at the terminal secondary level disappears, in general. It is suggested that if females place more time and involvement in mathematics, to the level of males, then sex differences in achievement shall gradually disappear. (MP)",

The intent of the materials was to increase the environmental awareness, knowledge, and management skills of future decision makers by teaching about major biological concepts and ecological interactions in an informal educational setting. Special characteristics of the program include a national scope within regional and local diversity, flexible use patterns, &quot;leaderproof&quot; activities, multidisciplinary approach, and  grassroots involvement. This report outlines, phase by phase, the procedures used in developing OBIS and offers a model useful to other curriculum developers interested in producing attractive, community-based materials.

The appendix describes the purpose of each experiment and indicates the project report publication number that summarizes the results of the findings. The body of the report presents the integrated results of all the experiments and what the project staff thinks the results  mean. Major findings are: (1) students respond to naturalistic and laboratory tasks differently; (2) differences in expectations about the task variables account for much of the variance between laboratory and naturalistic tasks; (3) subjects learn what they are taught about controlling variables and about expectations, but do not readily generalize their training to new situations; (4) scientific reasoning overlaps extensively with general ability, but also overlaps with an aspect of field-dependence-independence identified in the studies.

Lessons are provided for the curriculum areas of social inquiry, ethical development, and civic competence. In the social inquiry lessons, students learn to describe and explain human behavior. In the ethical development lessons, students reason about what is morally right or wrong for an individual person to do. The concern of the civic competence lessons is with the formulation of a policy and law for the society as a whole. For each curriculum area there is an introduction, sample topics and focus questions, and an explanation of the thinking skills emphasized in the lessons. For each thinking skill, there are exercises for practice. Formulating and testing hypotheses  are the major critical-thinking skills taught in the social inquiry lessons. The critical-thinking skills taught in the ethical development and civic competence lessons are giving reasons for value positions taken, identifying factual claims being made in arguments, raising questions about the truth of factual claims, identifying undesirable consequences of policy positions, identifying value claims, raising conflicting values, and raising questions of consistency. The lessons are self-contained. Some examples follow. A hypothesis is presented followed by data. Students must decide whether the data support the hypothesis. In another exercise, students are given value positions (e.g., the use of marijuana should be legalized) and asked to write at least one reason to support the position.  (Author/RM)",

        "description":"This study investigated quantitative differences in commitment between three age groups of children toward eight societal components: self, home, neighborhood, school, religion, voluntary membership organization, state, and country. Participating in the study were 469 school-age students in 18 randomly selected classrooms in six randomly selected school districts in southeast Texas. The sample had 169 fifth-grade students, 159 eighth-grade students, and 141 eleventh-grade students. Each student filled out a values questionnaire. Findings include the following. For values toward self, religious organization, voluntary membership organization, state, and country, there were significant differences in expressed values toward societal components between age groups. In every instance  of a significant difference, the eighth-grade students scored lowest. This was not surprising since the early adolescent years are known to be a time of emotional turmoil, insecurity, and adjustment. From a quantitative point of view, the values toward these components were as high at the fifth-grade level as they could be expected to be during most of the remainder of the public school career. Values were not arranged in a linearly upward sequence, with older students expressing higher values than the younger. Much of the affective makeup of the individual appears to have been learned by the time he is in the fifth grade. It appears, then, that schools should expend considerable effort in nurturing values toward these components in the formative years of their students.  (Author/RM)",

A planning group with representatives from the university and from the local school district met to develop courses to meet the specific needs of teachers in the project schools which include two elementary, one junior high, and one high school. The special requirements of the university were also considered as the course proposals were being developed. Three five-week courses were approved: (1) Introduction to Education That Is Multi-cultural; (2) Teaching Ethnic Studies; and (3) Teaching in Multi-cultural Schools. The paper describes the first of these three courses. At the first class session, teachers from all grade  levels were given an overview of the concerns of multi-cultural education, shared what they were presently doing in the area of multi-cultural education, and identified related concerns and problems. The teachers then identified activities, speakers, and resources that were included in the course. Much planning and coordinating went into utilizing community resources. The course was evaluated in several ways including assessment of teacher projects and pre- and post-tests. Evaluations were positive. The paper concludes with reflections and observations of the inservice coordinator. Appendices include course proposals, class schedules, evaluation forms and results, and selected planning documents. (Author/RM)",

It can be used by teachers, curriculum specialists, school administrators, and local boards in other states as well. According to the framework, the central purpose of history/social science education is to prepare students to be humane, rational, understanding, and participating citizens in a diverse society and in an increasingly interdependent world. The first two sections describe the philosophy and major emphases of the framework. Section three includes knowledge, skills, values, and social participation goals. The fourth section indicates the content or areas of study recommended for each grade level. In the fifth  section, the basic concepts are defined for anthropology, economics, geography, history, political science, psychology, sociology, and the humanities. There are three appendices. Appendix A contains the criteria for evaluating instructional materials in history and the social sciences. In Appendix B, sections of the Education Code requiring the observance of special events are described. The antidogmatism policy of the California State Board of Education is contained in the third appendix. The framework concludes with a list of references. (Author/RM)",

There are four major chapters to the book. Chapter I is titled \"Research on the Teaching of Writing.\" The articles in this first section move from a survey of research in writing to a survey of classroom practice in the use of writing in elementary school social studies and finally to a specific classroom study that integrates the two areas and presents specific implications for the study and teaching of writing. Chapter II is titled \"Developing Readiness in Writing.\" The first two articles stress two important aspects of a classroom environment that nurtures and supports student writing. The remaining  five articles describe techniques such as interviewing, exploring the past, and brainstorming that teachers can use to initiate writing. The title of Chapter III which contains seven articles is \"Using Writing to Learn Social Studies Content.\" The articles describe ways in which writing can be used to help students learn social studies information or develop social studies generalizations. Another describes how writing can be used to conduct simulated field trips in the social studies classroom. The title of Chapter IV is \"Combining Writing with Social Studies.\" Discussed are three essential supports for a successful program: a detailed curriculum guide, inservice teacher training, and cooperative teacher/administrator assessment procedures. The book also cites related resources in the  ERIC system. (Author/RM)",

Topics related to aging are often quantitative, and therefore, subject to mathematical analysis and procedures. The activities, which contain teacher suggestions and all student handouts, deal with seven topics. In the first activity, &quot;Graying of America,&quot; students extract data from a graph of U.S. population growth to solve problems which illustrate changes in the age structure of society as they and their parents grow older. &quot;Life Expectancy&quot; is the topic of the second activity. Students use actuarial data to compute the probability of surviving a given number of years beyond a certain age. In the third activity, &quot;Compound Interest and Population  Growth,&quot; students gain insight into population growth by working through a problem involving compound interest and then applying the same mathematical concepts to a problem involving birthrates and deathrates. The fourth activity deals with &quot;Changing Age Structure and Implications.&quot; Using bar graphs and mathematical skills, students estimate by age groups the proportion of people in society who are economically productive compared to those who are primarily consumers of goods and services. The last three activities deal with social security. Students compute the amount a typical worker can expect to pay into social security and the amount he or she can expect to receive during retirement. They also write a computer program to estimate 1978 revenues and expenditures. (Author/RM)",

Over 100 artists and 3000 teachers who participated in the AIS program taught architecture, dance, fiction writing, filmmaking, music, photography, poetry, and theatre to over 100,000 elementary and secondary students. The program emphasized that the arts are participatory and part of everyday life. Pre- and posttests were administered to students. In addition, principals, curriculum specialists, teachers, artists, parents, and school board members were observed and/or interviewed about the program. The results indicated that the AIS program was perceived as adding a great deal to the curriculum and to the positive attitudes of the people involved. However, there is a  need for additional orientation to the program and ways to integrate it into mathematics, the natural sciences, and the social sciences. Further role definitions are needed for principals, artists, and students. An inservice training program has been designed in response to these needs. The appendices which comprise the bulk of this report contain the evaluation model and instruments used and tables of data showing the evaluation results by the eight program areas listed above.

        "description":"This paper discusses the historical background of the creationist movement, presents Federal Judge Overton's analysis of why and how the Creationists got the equal time evolution/creation teaching law passed in Arkansas, and examines how scientists and educators are reacting to the controversy. Creationists were set back when Overton declared Arkansas' 1981 equal time law unconstitutional on January 5, 1982. Overton's decision called the Arkansas law a subterfuge for state-enforced public school teaching of religion. The passage of the legislation had been carefully orchestrated by Paul Ellwanger, a fundamentalist who developed &quot;balanced treatment&quot; model bills omitting religion or God so as to withstand constitutional challenge and used wording that appeals to Americans' sense of  fair play in presenting both sides. Judge Overton traced the origin of fundamentalism as evangelical Protestant reaction to modernism and change. Fundamentalists disagree with Darwin's theory of evolution. They were upset by late 19th and early 20th century German biblical criticism. In the 1920's they campaigned successfully against drinking (Prohibition) and introduced 37 anti-evolution teaching bills. Fundamentalists won in the Scopes trial. Not until the 1957 Soviet Sputnik frightened Americans to improve science teaching did the National Science Foundation finance new biology textbooks with evolution as a basic concept. This was one factor that stimulated the Creationists' recent activism. Late to respond, scientists and educators have organized committees of correspondence in 44  states to fight Creationists' national campaign aimed at having fundamentalists introduce a model equal time bill in most state legislatures and in the U.S. Congress.

It is the contention of the developers that consumers should influence the environments in which they make their decisions rather than merely accept the marketplace conditions which confront them. The publication first outlines citizen participation concepts. Each concept is defined and its application to consumer education is discussed. Twelve current factors which affect consumer decisions such as inflationary pressures and changes in roles of men and women are described. The major portion of the publication discusses the purposes, audience, and time schedule for the workshop and presents exercises and learning activities. There are two major  workshop learning activities. Participants first identify consumer concerns related to the work of their organizations or agencies. They then identify bargaining strategies for dealing with these consumer concerns. The citizen participation concepts are used to set up a framework for triggering ideas about consumer applications to a wide range of organizations. Worksheets are provided for these exercises. Other workshop activities involve participants in role playing, in listening to guest speakers, and analyzing case studies. Also provided in the publication is a sample workshop agenda, assessment and follow up forms, and a selected bibliography. (Author/RM)",

The report covers five years, beginning with U.S. participation in the International Women's Year Conference, Mexico City, 1975, and continuing through to the present. Background information, the agenda, committee reports, and conference outcomes and conclusions are discussed. The World Conference was a difficult meeting for the United States because many parts of the agenda was politicized. The conference sparked a great deal of interest among women's organizations and feminist activists in the United States. In its preparation process, the U.S. Secretariat continually explained  the meaning of a government-to-government conference, i.e., that delegates are instructed and, when speaking officially, must reflect official U.S. government positions and policies. Unfortunately, there were instances when U.S. policies ran contrary to what some American women wanted the delegation to say, and when this happened, resentment and frustration grew. For many American women, Copenhagen was their first exposure to a forum where anti-American sentiment was openly expressed. Although on a personal level delegates and observers interacted in a spirit of friendship, during formal presentations and discussions many statements critical of the United States were made. The problem was exacerbated by the naivete of some U.S. women. The United States voted against the conference's  Program of Action because of three paragraphs which refer to the Middle East in ways which are antithetical to U.S. foreign policy. (Author/RM)",

Research literature in the second area is on the selection and preparation of black prospective teachers, the role of historically black colleges and universities, standardized testing for admission to schools of education, and special curriculum needs of black teachers. The third area of literature addressed  the problems imposed on black beginning teachers, including initial certification and the National Teacher Examination, employment inequities, and special demands of schools and communities on black teachers. The effects of research on black teachers and the need for a black perspective in educational research are the topics of the fourth area of literature.

The elementary and secondary school teachers were finalists or winners of National Teacher of the Year competitions, while the college professors were recipients of distinguished teaching awards at their respective institutions. The impressions gained from class observations and interviews with the teachers, their supervisors, colleagues, and students are recorded for each teacher in the form of a brief descriptive portrait. The teachers' attitudes were surveyed for  perceptions of self, others, and teaching. In addition, analysis of the results of two behavioral tests are discussed, and the teachers' responses to questions about their careers, influential teachers, and major career obstacles are presented. Ten dimensions or characteristics held in common by the teachers are described, and the teachers' attitudes toward and suggestions for teacher education programs are listed. A synthesis of the study is offered, and nine references and the test instruments are appended. \"The Search for Excellence in Teaching: An Annotated Bibliography\" was compiled by I. David Glick from an initial collection of 1,300 articles. The 29 selected documents include journal articles, books, and papers written since 1971.

Accompanying the program were graduate-level courses and practica for prospective teachers of gifted children and coordinators of programs for the gifted. The 1981 summer program consisted of six dimensions: (1) thinking skills and creative arts for kindergarten through second grade students; (2) study in graphics, dramatics, computers, photography, and the performing arts for fourth through eighth grade students; (3) field experiences for fourth through seventh grade students; (4) seventh grade seminars; (5) drama workshops for  eighth through twelfth grade students; and (6) gifted education courses for teachers. A discussion of the fourth dimension of the summer program, the seventh grade seminars, describes criteria for identifying gifted students, and the general format of the program. The teacher practicum (sixth dimension) consisted of a series of formal and informal experiences that allowed the teachers to design and execute specific learning activities for gifted students. A profile of a gifted teacher is outlined and offers considerations of the personal and professional attributes that are necessary for a teacher of gifted children. A comparison is made of this program and similar programs at Purdue University, the University of South Florida, and three universities in England.

        "description":"Tenured faculty can be dismissed for reasons of financial exigency. If the employment contract provides a specific definition of fiscal exigency and the processes to be used in effecting retrenchment, then those terms govern in lieu of constitutional due process. In the absence of such guidance, courts are willing to allow dismissal for reasons of financial exigency within certain limits. The institution as a whole need not be in an exigent condition to justify dismissal of some faculty, nor must the exigency extend to the endowment or real property of the institution. The institution has the burdens of proving not only financial exigency, but also that dismissal was motivated by the exigent condition. The institution must also show that its selection process was not arbitrary,  capricious, or discriminatory. Tenured faculty who are to be dismissed for reasons of financial exigency must be notified and have an opportunity for a hearing before dismissal. Beyond these requirements, faculty have no constitutional right to participate in the retrenchment process. Dismissed faculty, if they are qualified, have the right to available positions in the institution, but in the absence of contract language they have no right to positions held by others and no right to retraining for available positions if they are not qualified at the time of dismissal. Thirty-six court cases are described and discussed in this monograph, and recommendations are made for adoption of legally acceptable policies and procedures for teacher dismissal at educational institutions.

Current thought on the need for these individuals to play major roles as decision makers in developing inservice programs is examined through literature reviews and case studies. The first chapter introduces differing philosophies on the nature of inservice and the roles of inservice participants. The rationale for active practitioner participation in inservice programs is discussed in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 offers representative case studies of field-based projects that involved teachers working actively with educational researchers. Chapter 4 surveys practitioner  involvement in the delivery and utilization of knowledge. In the fifth chapter, consideration is given to the relationship between school practitioners' level of involvement in decision making and the degree of satisfaction they derive from their jobs. Case studies and analyses are presented of three programs designed to rely upon practitioner involvement in school decision making. The final chapter explores problems that may arise from increased practitioner involvement in professional improvement programs and considers the implications for future trends.

        "description":"The University College of Saint Joseph's University (Pennsylvania) has developed the Experiential Learning Assessment Program (ELAP) which is designed for University College students who wish to apply to and be assessed for college credits gained through experiential learning. The need for such a program was recognized when Archdiocesan teachers, who had received initial training at the University College, found themselves, according to state education department standards, deficient in coursework. On their return to the university, the parochial school teachers contended that their skills and experience made the completion of education courses redundant. To receive credit for prior (experiential) learning, students must be enrolled at a University College program. If the  pre-assessment interview determines that the ELAP is an appropriate alternative, the student applies for assessment of prior learning competencies. A faculty member acts as assessor and works with the candidate to establish the ELAP Review and Agreement Contract. This documents the proposed methods for examining the competencies of the candidate in each subject area. Upon the completion of the contract and payment of assessment fees, the actual assessment procedure begins. Evaluation techniques may be written or oral examination, performance test, or product evaluation. The evaluation results are documented in an ELAP Credit Report Recommendation. Appended are samples of the forms used in the ELAP process and a schematic representation of ELAP. (FG)",

The program focuses on the cafeteria as the hub of the school, since profound interaction has been observed between activity in the cafeteria and in other school settings. An overview provides a discussion of the total school environment, pointing out its composite parts: physical attributes, school rules on behavior, attitudes related to responsible behaviors in school settings, and decision making. Ways in which activities  suggested in the handbook can be carried out are described. A format for conducting workshops to increase awareness of the school environment and to plan activities to improve attitudes and behaviors is presented. Four workshop activities are introduced: (1) to promote awareness of the school environment; (2) to assess problems and opportunities for change within the school setting; (3) to plan for achieving specific goals; and (4) to evaluate the success of the program. A questionnaire is provided for use in each of these activities. A case study is presented of a workshop that was successfully conducted using the format offered in this handbook.

The first of these is self-awareness in the school environment, the second is awareness of settings within the school environment, and the third is awareness of general school environment. Forms are provided for clarifying personal attitudes and behaviors and for drawing up an individual daily activities profile. Activities are presented to help the individual identify  some of the important settings in the school, to become aware of the location of significant settings, and to identify settings in which significant interactions take place. Forms are provided to aid in examining the physical characteristics of the school environment and the rules that govern behavior in that environment. The emphasis is upon the ways that these dimensions influence school participants and their interactions with each other. The second section is designed to aid in assessing the school environment and in investigating the attitudes and behaviors of the people in the school. Forms are provided for assessing personal strengths, weaknesses, and attitudes. Three worksheets are designed to allow individuals to assess and analyze specific locations in the school, problems they  may present, and rules that govern behaviors in those settings.

Forty-seven percent completed and returned the questionnaire. They reported that the chief function of their school was instruction, followed, in order of emphasis, by preservice teacher education, research, and inservice teacher education. A range of instructional methodologies was used by these schools, with 46.6 percent using a combination of traditional and experimental techniques. In provisions for teacher education the methods used in the laboratory schools were clinical or mini-teaching experiences, observations by students, and student teaching. The most prolific researchers in laboratory schools were school faculty members, followed by other  college and university faculty members. Research was also done by cooperative efforts between laboratory school and other faculty members, as well as by students. Inservice education was accomplished primarily by internal training conducted by laboratory school teachers. However, conferences of local, state, regional, and national levels were also used, as well as external consulting services. Some of the schools reported that their continued existence was questionable. Funding appeared to be a major problem. It is suggested that laboratory schools should expand research and inservice activities, and improve teacher education efforts. (JD)",

        "description":"Within the last five years there has been a great deal of change in the role of technology in the schools. The advent of microcomputers has had an impact on instructional techniques as has the development of interactive graphics and animation, and other technologies such as videodisc and micronet. Teacher educators face the responsibility of preparing teachers to teach students who will be living and working in the computer age. There are three major issues that teacher educators must consider in addressing the effect of computers on curriculum and instruction. First, educators should consider ways that the proliferation of computers and the growth of computer-related technologies can and should affect the content of curriculum and instruction. A second issue to be considered is  how the availability of computers in schools can and should affect the quality of appropriate content. The implications of the computer age for teacher education comprise the third issue. The Technology and Basic Skills Project - Mathematics at Ohio State University addresses all three issues as they are related to the teaching of mathematical concepts and problem solving skills to middle grade students. The program's principles and techniques are generalizable to other grades and to other subject areas. A primary principle of the program is that computers should be viewed by both the student and the teacher as a tool with multiple uses, including record keeping, data collecting, altering the content and quality of instruction, and problem solving. Effective use of computers can afford  learners the opportunity to experiment with and control the cognitive environment in which they are working and learning. Teacher educators must begin to prepare teachers for the computer age and must focus on the very best this technology can offer to education. (JD)",

Eleven middle school teachers were interviewed about their orientation toward and operation in their schools. They were asked what they thought were their schools' most important features, how they felt about the buildings, what were its good and bad points, and what changes they had made in their classrooms and buildings. Student behavior management arose as the dominant focus of the interviews; curriculum and instruction were nearly ignored. The teachers varied in their level of awareness or sensitivity to the school environment, its effect on them, and their perception of control over it. Adjustments to the classroom setting were uppermost in their minds, while adjustment  to the school beyond their own classrooms was perceived as someone else's domain. Most did not indicate that they used the environment or saw its potential as a curriculum variable. In comments about instruction and the school environment, they were most likely to mention the conveniece of having a classroom located near the library, a book storage area, or other resource materials. Wall space was seldom used for instructional purposes. Some indicated that they organized furniture to support instructional activities, although the typical arrangement remained straight rows of desks and chairs. Virtually all the teachers volunteered information on their use of the environment to control student behavior. Classroom location had some impact on the teachers' social activities and friendship  patterns. It is important that preservice teachers be instructed on the effects and uses of school space. (JD)",

Teacher clarity indicators were identified as vagueness terms and mazes. Vagueness terms are indicated by approximation or lack of clarity and assurance. Mazes are garbles, stutters, slips of the tongue, false starts, and redundancy. Students in both the experimental and control groups were completing certification requirements or were updating certificates they currently held. All students were assigned two lesson topics to prepare for presentation to a class. After the students in the experimental group presented their first lesson, the investigator defined vagueness terms and mazes. Sample tapes of the  lessons were played and the experimental group was trained to identify and quantify vagueness terms and mazes. Ways to reduce the frequency of these terms and mazes were discussed. In reviewing their taped discussions, no mention of vagueness terms and mazes was made to students in the control group. Students in the experimental group reduced their use of vagueness terms and mazes from the first lesson, while those in the control group reduced only the frequency of mazes. Although these research results were interpreted within certain limitations, it can be concluded that teachers can be trained to significantly reduce the frequency of vagueness terms by focusing on the terms and by preparing lessons to eliminate them. Mazes can be reduced by simply presenting lessons and reviewing their  presentations. (JD)",

        "description":"This study sought to determine the difference between learning with the aid of a motion picture presenting the visual field of the performer and the performer in action and learning with the aid of a motion picture presenting only the performer in action. Two motion pictures of a student tracking on a pursuit rotary unit constituted the experimental factors. The first motion picture was taken from the point of view of a spectator; the second motion picture showed both the view of the spectator and the visual field of the person tracking. The subjects were divided into three groups identified as control, experimental spectators, and experimental performers. The control group did not view either of the motion pictures. Subjects in the experimental spectator group were instructed to  watch the film of the person tracking and see if they could see anything that would help them to track better. The experimental performer group viewed the motion picture from both the performer field of view and the view of the spectator. Both experimental groups were instructed to employ any technique that they may have seen in the film to improve their own target time. Findings indicated there was no difference in learning under the three different conditions. Two conclusions are drawn from the findings. One concerns the type of skill to be learned. More significant information should be present in the visual field of a gross motor task as opposed to the fine motor task of tracking. The second conclusion concerned the presence or absence of danger in the skill. Skills that require the  body to make moves at the recognition of visual cues or risk an injury might benefit from visual field photography as a training tool. (JD)",

Nineteen eighth grade students, who were predominantly white, and of the middle or upper middle class, were the subjects. The students were asked to conduct an interviewer on a grand tour and then various mini-tours of their activities during a school day. They also were asked to categorize different activities as either work or play. This was done to help them articulate their precise thoughts and feelings about the nature of work and play. Work activities were commonly perceived by the students as things they had to do whether they wanted to or not, and among the reasons they did them was because the teacher graded them. Play activities were seen as things  the students did because they wanted to and because they were fun. The findings suggested that students see their school activities in terms of work or play. A discussion is presented on the importance of developing instructional activities and curricula to increase their play-like qualities and to provide higher motivation for students. (JD)",

        "description":"The faculty lounge of a junior high school was chosen as the site for observation of teachers in this study of social interactions and attitudes. The study focused on the effect of the segregation or isolation of the individual teacher (who functions as an autonomous unit in the classroom) upon the school as an organization and upon attempts to bring about educational change. The teachers were segregated from each other by the organizational pattern and physical layout of the school. However, they shared common classroom problems as well as other problems. Conversation in the faculty lounge consisted mainly of brief, sporadic interchanges that were casually social in nature. It was observed that, for the most part, classroom realities were the main topic of their short  conversational exchanges. They discussed the difficulties of controlling a class, particular students, the nature of adolescent students, and the necessity of teaching certain subjects. Discussion of the problems of being a teacher centered around rewards and drawbacks, the effects of teaching upon themselves, their public image, and the lack of support from parents and the community. The teachers, however, saw themselves as a generally good group of people doing a good job. They perceived themselves as a unit within the larger organizational framework of the school system, and, within the parameters of their own classrooms, powerful. The efforts of teachers to clarify their individuality and commonality suggest that those who propose changes at the school level must be aware not only of  classroom realities but also of teachers' problems. Teachers will resist change they feel has no clear or immediate value for their students or themselves. (JD)",

        "description":"This study was designed to assess the effectiveness of a group-based, teacher-paced model of mastery learning for instruction in undergraduate education courses. It was hypothesized that the mastery-taught students, who were provided formative tests and corrective activities, would achieve higher scores on the final examination and higher grades in the course than the control group. It was also hypothesized that the experimental group would demonstrate greater interest in their learning than the control group by attending class more regularly. Subjects were advanced sophomores or first semester juniors enrolled in six sections of a one-semester course dealing with topics in educational psychology and teaching exceptional children in the mainstreamed classroom. Fifty-five students  constituted the mastery learning group, and the control group had 142 students. A series of formative tests were developed for the experimental group with accompanying feedback and corrective activities. Corrective work was completed outside of class by those students who did not attain 90 percent mastery on the formative tests. Although the course content, sequence of topics, activities, and group-based instruction were identical in all sections, only in the mastery learning sections were regular checks on learning progress coupled with corrective activities. At the end of the term, students in all sections were administered a common final examination. An analysis of the results indicated that the mastery group demonstrated higher levels of achievement than their peers trained in a  typical lecture approach. The significantly fewer absences in the mastery learning group suggested that, concomitant with their superior achievement, these students were more interested in their coursework. (JD)",

The focus of the study was upon the influence this change in effectiveness might have upon measures of teachers' feelings of responsibility for student achievement, feelings toward teaching, and teachers' self-concept. Fifty-two secondary school teachers participated in a workshop on mastery learning techniques. They agreed to teach two classes in the same subject area and grade level during the school term following their training. One of these classes was to be taught using mastery learning (mastery group), the other to be taught by whatever methods the teacher typically employed (control group). Before the workshop sessions, the teachers were  given a three-part questionnaire on their feelings of responsibility for student achievement, their feelings toward teaching, and their confidence in their teaching ability. Following the school term, the teachers were again tested, and the achievements of their mastery and control students were evaluated. A high percentage of the teachers were found to have experienced positive change in their instructional effectiveness through mastery teaching. An analysis of results indicated that, as the teachers became more effective in their teaching, they tended to accept greater responsibility for the learning outcomes of their students and to like teaching much more but, at the same time, expressed diminished confidence in their teaching abilities. In post-testing, the teachers who chose not to  use the mastery techniques expressed increased confidence in their teaching but revealed increasingly negative feelings about teaching. The implications of this study for inservice education are discussed. (JD)",

A secondary purpose was to investigate the effectiveness of several models through which the researchers were trained. The three models consisted of: (1) a dyad composed of a Hampton Institute junior faculty member and a University of Michigan senior faculty member; (2) a triad with a Hampton Institute junior faculty member, a University of Michigan senior faculty member, and a University of Michigan doctoral student; and (3) a triad composed of a Hampton Institute junior faculty member and University of Michigan senior and junior faculty members.  Questionnaires, participant logs, and interviews were used to evaluate the program. It was noted that the dyads tended to become triads, through merging with other groups or by involving other staff members or graduate students. The triads were found to enhance a collegial, rather than a tutorial, relationship among participants. A major difficulty throughout the program was time restraints, especially for the Hampton Institute faculty, who had more duties than the other participants. Peer support emerged as an important success factor for the participants, who profited from the opportunity to interact with peers outside their specialization.

The information is intended for program planners, evaluation personnel, and teachers. Only activities that involve parents in the education of their child so as to improve his academic competence are discussed. The methods of parent education are difficult to define. Many parents may have access to successful child rearing information, but are unable to implement these ideas. There is also no evidence of a causal relationship between specific parental and child behavior. Most programs of parent participation provide joint activities to develop a child's language and cognitive skills. Other programs emphasize the process of learning as more  important than the content. These programs encourage parents to allow exploration in a safe and stimulating environment. A multi-faceted evaluation strategy is necessary which is matched to the program. Evaluation should focus on the program, not the parents. Instruments should be short, simple, and readily analyzed to yield information useful for program improvement. Parents should be involved in planning, implementing and evaluating their own programs.

The selection of children needing early childhood Title I services is complicated by the lack of criteria for defining who is educationally disadvantaged and the special problems of early childhood testing and measurement. The study used re-analysis of longitudinal data on children in Head Start Planned Variation and Follow Through programs. The second approach used meta-analysis to synthesize results of studies that examined relationships between early childhood predictors and later outcomes. The strengths and weaknesses of these approaches complemented each other. Methods of selection and their predictive validity were the main focus of the paper. Another factor to be considered included costs of  selection procedure. Special problems exist in assessing young children because tests for this age group are often of lower technical quality. Preschool children often lack the physical, intellectual and emotional prerequisites necessary for systematic assessment. Selection bias may result from the use of tests or variables which have different predictive validity for different groups. The importance of prediction stems from the goal of most ECT-I programs: the prevention of educational problems in later schooling. (DWH)",

The primary purpose of the program is to provide special instruction to those students who fail -- or, who are at risk to fail -- to meet the state's minimum standards, as assessed by the upcoming Test of Basic Skills. The first year's implementation of this program consists of building a research database on a variety of compensatory/remedial instruction models for second-graders at risk for failure to meet the minimum standards. Seventeen projects were awarded funding, of which two were planning projects, 13 were pilot projects, and two were demonstration projects. It is intended that this  evaluation report will provide information required to select the most promising of these models for larger-scale implementation and demonstration. The two projects approved for planning and training of personnel excelled in precisely those areas, and seven of the 15 pilot and demonstration projects demonstrated at least suggestive positive effects on student achievement in one or more skill areas.

Students learned Lasswell's framework for understanding human needs and motives, a systematic decision-making procedure, and information about the pharmacological, psychological, and social consequences of licit and illicit drug use. The course focused primarily upon \"soft\" drug use--tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana. One social studies class from each of nine matched pairs was randomly assigned to receive the drug education course. The remaining classes constituted the control group. The follow-up questionnaire was administered one year after the completion of the course. Testing covered (1) drug knowledge; (2) general attitudes toward drug use; (3) perceived benefits  and costs of various types of substance use; (4) perceived peer attitudes toward, and use of, various substances; and (5) intentions to use, current use, and lifetime use of various substances. The only short-term effect of the course that sustained at follow-up was greater drug knowledge for grade 8 males. As compared to their controls, the experimental students were more opposed to hard drug use. (Author/GK)",

Students in Cross-Age Tutoring were taught tutoring and communication skills and spent four days per week tutoring at nearby elementary schools; students in School Store were taught business and interpersonal skills and operated an on campus store. These courses are examples of the \"Alternatives\" or \"Service Opportunities\" approaches to substance abuse prevention. The general goals of the courses were to foster positive attitudes and behaviors regarding self, peers, and school. These changes were expected to reduce, in subsequent years, student acceptance and use of psychoactive substances. Process data included: a survey of  participants at the end of the course, observation of selected course sessions and practica, and interviews with teachers and some students from each course. Both courses (including practica) were well received by the students. Analyses of covariance did not reveal a coherent pattern of treatment effects. The lack of treatment effects was attributed to a possible failure of the courses to require sustained effort for mastery of goals, and to stimulate adequate commitment among the participating students.

The first - &quot;going native&quot; - arises when the evaluator has consciously adopted the value and belief system of those in the program he or she is evaluating. The second problem - ethnocentrism - arises when the evaluator has been sufficiently blinded by his or her own value system that he or she fails to see, and thus take into account, divergent values that characterize audiences or recognize how those values reshape objectives or goals. Both types of problems create overt and subtle bias in evaluation reports which in turn leads to skewed judgments, suspect recommendations, loss of evaluator and  evaluation credibility, and legitimation of the failure to utilize evaluation results. Solutions to both problems are developed and include, among other strategies, the audit (including means for establishing an audit trail), the reflexive journal, and peer debriefing. (Author/GK)",

They do so by performing two functions. Political linkage provides knowledge about the impacts of mandates on specific districts and helps negotiate acceptable interpretations. Technical linkage entails learning research- and practice-based knowledge about instruction and administration. This paper describes how field staff from RESAs in two states (New Jersey and Pennsylvania) perform three roles--trainer, liaison, and monitor that contribute to each kind of linkage. Findings from an analysis of data from 138 field agents in 23 RESAs indicates that trainers focus  on technical linkage while monitors emphasize political linkage. Liaison types provide both linkages. The study also indicates how state policy helps determine the kind of linkage provided. (Author/GK)",

The data utilized were the item responses to tests in basic mathematics and in general biology administered as pretests and after instruction to students enrolled in those courses. Results indicated that this assumption was not tenable in the biology data set, where increases in mean achievement level were accompanied by corresponding changes in the factor structure underlying the item  responses.

Findings were presented from literature reviews. Regarding testwiseness, (1) it can be described, measured, and taught, therefore, testwiseness exists; (2) testwiseness is only mildly related to general intelligence as measured by group intelligence tests and is probably a network of specific skills, not a general cognitive ability; (3) testwiseness increases with maturity and is unrelated to sex; (4) although testwiseness skills can be taught to students of all ages, using a variety of techniques, the affects of such instruction do not last long; (5) the differential effects of testwiseness  instruction for students at various points along the testwiseness continuum is unknown and may vary with the type of testwiseness skill under consideration; and, (6) for some groups of students, testwiseness instruction improves the reliability and predictive power of certain tests. No research was found on practice tests' effects on student performance or on the reliability or predictive power of the associated test.

        "description":"This study of Compensatory Education is divided into four parts: allocation of Title I funds and services, achievement and Compensatory Education, measurement of student growth, and the effects of attrition. Part one examines poverty concentrations to determine which schools and districts are eligible for Title I or for concentration grants. The methods for determining a school's poverty level are also presented. Part two discusses how and how well Title I and Compensatory Education are distributed at the student level. The results of student achievement test scores are compared with teachers' evaluation of students' needs for Compensatory Education. The procedures used in the selection and development of measures of academic growth, achievement, and affective growth are  described in part three. Part four describes the reduction in the sample of schools in the second year of the study after funding cutbacks. Also reported is the incidence of student attrition compared over several characteristics including achievement level and minority status. (Author/JCD)",

Moreover, the conclusions are not warranted by their evidence. In implementing the research, Coleman and his associates used inadequate measures of cognitive outcomes, employed erroneous sampling procedures, and based conclusions on biased methods of analysis. One phase of analysis used a multiple regression approach with 17 background variables that was selectively biased against public schools. A second analysis, which attempted to show that Catholic schools are more  egalitarian because they produce similar test scores among students with diverse backgrounds, was biased because it excluded relevant variables and because the range of student cognitive abilities was narrower in the Catholic sector than in the public sector. The third analysis which studied sophomore to senior change in scores did not control for background. Finally, the analysis which attributed test score gains in the private sector to selected school policies was based on choosing certain variables as &quot;policy&quot; without considering student ability and background.

        "description":"For several years, the Federal government of the United States has supported programs that employ and teach skills to disadvantaged workers, especially disadvantaged youth. By concentrating on serving youth, such programs have neglected disadvantaged adults, for whom such programs may often be more effective. This assertion is based on an experimental evaluation of a major subsidized work experience program called Supported Work, which was directed at groups selected partly because of their potential for committing crime. The groups in the demonstration sample for program evaluation included previously incarcerated offenders, known drug addicts, and youths known to be or considered likely to become delinquent. Evaluation showed that the program had little effect on young  delinquents' post-program employment or on their criminal activity during or after participation in the program. However, among adult offenders and drug addicts, there was a tendency toward increased employment and reduced crime. The results of this experiment thus suggest that older disadvantaged workers, including those who are known offenders, may be much more responsive to the opportunity to participate in employment programs than those who are younger. It may be worthwhile to provide this opportunity more fully. (Author/MJL)",

By building on implicit contract theory, this paper takes into account circumstances ignored in the traditional model: (1) institutional characteristics of the labor market enhance contracting possibilities by creating additional possibilities for commitments, and reduce or eliminate the problem of agencies; (2) workers vary in their preferences and in their levels of productivity across different firms; and (3) firms vary in the way the marginal productivity of labor is affected by the business cycle. The modified model presented in this paper assumes, therefore, that efficiency requires workers to switch among firms  as business conditions change. Although unreliable information on base employments and layoffs may present limitations on contract, these limitations are generally overcome by the familiar labor market institutions of severance pay, pension and retirement benefits, and a lifetime income curve that rises more swiftly than productivity. The model's accuracy is tested by ten hypotheses about how labor markets function. (JCD)",

It is hypothesized that the attractiveness of disability income transfer options has led older male workers with health problems to choose transfer recipiency over work; this choice has led to the growth of disability transfer programs. In the framework presented, workers are in four categories: (1) seeking and obtaining employment; (2) seeking but not obtaining employment; (3) applying for disability and being found eligible; and (4) applying for disability and being found ineligible. The report concludes that worker response to increased  transfer program leniency is a statistically significant though quantitatively small factor in the work status choice. (JCD)",

        "description":"In this statement, William Bradford Reynolds, Assistant Attorney General, discusses the Federal government's enforcement policies and activities regarding equal employment opportunity, and defends the Reagan Administration and the Justice Department against charges cited in a report by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. Reynolds contends that the Administration's civil rights policies are based on the principle that discrimination is morally wrong, but the remedial use of preferential hiring and promotion techniques violates rather than promotes the principle of equal employment opportunity. He also contends that although the &quot;color-blindness&quot; principle established by Title VII enabled minorities to compete effectively with members of other groups, employment preferences  serve to hire and promote with discrimination. Reynolds suggests that the use of racial quotas has not necessarily resulted in the hiring of unqualified employees, but in the hiring of lesser qualified employees on the basis of race or sex. Reynolds concludes that adherence to the color-blind and sex-neutral ideal of equal opportunity is essential for the reduction of discriminatory practices in employment. (JCD)",

First, an overview of State domestic violence statutes and relief services is presented. The present responses and potential roles of police officers, prosecutors and judges are examined in subsequent chapters. In these chapters, the failure of police officers and judges to recognize the seriousness of domestic violence, and the tendency among prosecutors to treat such cases differently from those involving violence between stranqers are discussed. The failure of judges to impose sanctions commensurate with the offense and their emphasis on preservation of the marital relationship  at the expense of a battered woman's life and limb are also examined. The use of diversionary programs such as counseling and mediation which channel complaints out of the criminal justice system as well as the social services, shelters, and legal services available to battered women are also covered in this report. The final chapter reiterates the Commission's findings and sets forth recommendations for reform. (JCD)",

The instructional approaches and activities of Title I students and regular students are compared. Instructional and cost effectiveness of CE services, the relationship between instructional costs and achievement, and the nature of achievement growth over the summer are also examined. (JCD)",

Chapter one presents CMLRP components and potential advantages for big city students. Chapter two discusses CMLRP implementation in New York Community District 19 by giving the program's history and chronology, district-level instructional and organizational processes, and data on reading achievement. CMLRP implementation at individual schools in New York and Chicago are compared  in chapter three. Chapter four describes five schools using schoolwide approaches in Los Angeles and Chicago to improve instruction for students in concentrated poverty neighborhoods. Schoolwide approaches are defined as elimination of Title I pullout arrangements that fragment the education of low achievers. Finally, chapter five summarizes and discusses those school arrangements and processes identified with improved achievement in inner-city elementary schools. (ML)",

        "description":"This study explored the effects of sex on responses to 247 items in the &quot;Choice of Occupation Form&quot; among a sample of 500 junior high school students in Australia. It was argued that there was substantial interaction between the types of work chosen (i.e., contact with people versus things and sex in the most frequently and infrequently liked occupations). The greatest differences in occupational choices were in males' orientation towards activities and occupations commonly classified as realistic, mechanical, or technical and females' preferences for social or personal contact occupations. Results suggest caution in the use of the Choice of Occupation Form, since recommendations and inferences about interests made on the basis of occupational choices, either from guidance  interviews or from standardized tests, may be clearly sex-restrictive. Use of the sex-balanced items identified in the study may broaden choice options and ensure that vocational interests reflect a fundamental orientation towards things-people or data-ideas, rather than sex stereotypes of the effect of dominant forces in the society.

        "description":"Trade and industrial (T & I) instructors desiring professional development and credentialization through a university have numerous problems in validating and receiving credit for their technical competencies obtained through prior experiences and noncollegiate training. In the past, teachers have either acquired specialization competency based on college coursework, or specialization competency based on prior work experience. An approach which minimizes the shortcomings of both of these methods, however, is for T & I instructors to acquire specialization competency based on extensive work experience or a combination of work experience and technical credit. This approach is beneficial to both the institution and the individual. The institution will be attracting additional  students, thus generating more student credit hours and revenue. The T & I instructors will be able to more effectively and efficiently use their time and resources by getting recognition for their prior learning regardless of where it took place. A number of complementary assessment approaches may be useful for assessing prior experiential learning: (1) individualized assessment using a portfolio; (2) credit by examination, such as the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) exams; or (3) credit recommendations for noncollegiate courses. A seven-step model for assessing occupational experiential learning is proposed: select the occupational fields for assessment; identify the competencies; verify the work experience; relate the competencies to the curriculum and goals of the student;  measure occupational competence; evaluate and synthesize the measurement results; and determine the amount of credit to be awarded.

After showing the need for low-reading-level humanities materials for adults, the guide provides the solution based on how the humanities writing program was conducted by LVA. It then outlines the process of creating the materials, including originating, selecting staff and subject areas, training, writing, editing, preparing a manuscript, testing and revising a manuscript, and publishing the final  products. An estimate of costs and suggested sources of funding is given. Following a bibliography of material about adult new readers, the guide's appendixes contain sample administrative materials, materials for conducting a writing workshop, and blank evaluation questionnaires.

        "description":"Mass production, introduced into the factories of the United States in the early 1900s, required workers who were trained to be cooperative, loyal to the company, and possessed specific job skills to operate the machinery. To produce these workers, American corporations turned away from the educational programs of the public schools, and began to create their own industrial training programs. One of the most successful of these programs was the corporate educational program begun by P. W. Litchfield at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company in 1913. Litchfield's solution was the &quot;Flying Squadron&quot; training program. From this base, the corporate educational program expanded and, by the 1920s, was called the Goodyear Industrial Training Program. The formal educational program was  offered through the Goodyear Industrial University, an on-site factory-sponsored educational institution. By the 1930s, this program had grown and become recognized as one of the largest of the industrial educational programs in the United States. Lists of the successful placement and promotion of squadron men in books about the era point out how very successful the corporate educational policies and programs at Goodyear were in selecting, training, and keeping men in the organization and drawing on their talents to keep the organization a unified one. Education at Goodyear continues today and the &quot;Squadron&quot; idea is still in use, but the ideal of corporate education as advanced by P. W. Litchfield faded after the 1930s because of declining economic conditions, union demands, and  competition by the public schools. Today's training programs are specifically job-related rather than aiming at the general education of the workers. (KC)",

        "description":"Data from individual final project reports and evaluation reports prepared by external evaluators were compiled to evaluate the 17 local projects that were conducted in Tennessee during 1980-81 under the provisions of the Career Education Incentive Act. Included among those areas examined during the evaluation were the following: project activities and program components, advisory council composition and functioning, groups cooperating with the school system in implementing or maintaining career education efforts, needs assessment activities, staff participation and areas addressed in inservice, extent of participation in infusing career education into curricular areas, subject areas in which such infusion occurred, teachers' use of career education infusion techniques, project  accomplishments and publicity efforts, access to career education materials, and funding. After evaluating the 17 projects in terms of the 13 objectives specified in the 1980-81 Tennessee state plan for career education (most of which addressed needs for staff training and provision of instructional materials), researchers determined that nearly all the criterion-referenced objectives specified in the state plan were achieved. In only two areas did achievements fall somewhat below predicted levels. These areas were utilization of advisory councils and reduction of bias/stereotyping.

These units were intended to retrain errant, but potentially productive, first-term enlistees through a program of discipline, motivational and military skills training, and counseling. The research compared overall effectiveness in terms of attrition, performance, and recidivism and identified factors related to outcome measures and success within each program. Programs were evaluated on followup measures of attrition, performance, and disciplinary actions, as well as on interview data collected. Results indicated that individuals improved in their performance following  retraining but that the improvement decreased at six months. The frequency of disciplinary actions prior to and following retraining showed a significant decrease, indicating these retraining units were effective in countering disciplinary problems. Attrition data for one-year followup of these units showed that all units had a lower attrition than did a comparable control group, with CCU Coronado and BEST having substantially lower rates. Policy recommendations were developed for the CCUs/BEST units themselves, operational user commands, Navy corrections program, and further research and development. (Author/YLB)",

Unfortunately, these people often face insurmountable obstacles in finding a job, largely because of public and employer ignorance or prejudice toward them. The purpose of this pamphlet is to take a look at these people, at their advantages as potential employees as well as their shortcomings, and to give employers answers to questions that they frequently ask concerning mentally restored individuals and their ability to work. The following eight questions are considered from an employer's point of view: (1) Who are the mentally restored? (2) Can mentally restored persons succeed?  (3) What kinds of work are they suited for? (4) Will I have the problem of rapid turnover? (5) How will mentally restored workers affect my other employees? (6) Are mentally restored persons unpredictable and dangerous? (7) Will my taxes be affected? (8) Will my health and disability insurance costs go up? These questions are answered with facts in a manner meant to be reassuring to employers and to point out the benefits of hiring mentally restored persons. (KC)",

The Process employs the methods of \"language experience\" in response to the widely varied language abilities of the students. Those students who are literate and who have gained survival-level communication skills, available in another component of the program, are the target students of the model. The model offers administrators of ESL programs an effective structure in which a  professional ESL staff provides for training and supervision of community volunteers. Instruction is individualized in a one-to-one tutor-student relationship. The developers of the model state that it can be operated at less cost per student than the traditional classroom model if a sufficiently large space is available for effective interaction between staff and tutors. The manual is arranged in separate sections for administrators, staff, and tutors. Necessary forms, test materials, directions, and suggested activities are provided. Sections or pages may be removed and duplicated separately. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"Using the Role Delineation study as the basis (see CE 031 628), a project developed a criterion-referenced self-assessment examination for physican assistants (PAs) from which appropriate continuing education could be developed. Working committees consisting of PAs and PA educators first developed five 80-item test sections and then 315 items which were assembled into a six-hour, two-section examination. The domain of the examination was the competency skills and knowledge expected of an entry-level generalist PA and had been defined in terms of two sets of scales: 17 role scales and 28 body system scales. Following this discussion of the project procedures, certain technical issues are examined in section 3, including objectives of self-assessment examination, test  specifications, scales definition, item generation through use of the critical incidents technique, test item revision, test interpretation (proper use of test results), and technical limitations and deficiencies. Section 4 focuses on planning for the development of a national pilot continuing medical education system for PAs. Exhibits, amounting to approximately one-third of the volume, include an unprioritized list of program and research objectives, 11 areas of the PA Role Delineation, data tables and graphs from the two try-outs of the examination, and an example computer report and interpretive leaflet sent to persons who took the examination.

The first section defines productivity and introduces the problem of the decline of productivity in the United States; these concepts are augmented in the second section by a discussion of measures of productivity and real earnings as related to productivity. In section 3, the economic history of the United States is explored as it relates to the slowdown of productivity in recent years. Section 4 further explores the productivity problem--what caused it, what has happened to investment  incentives, and what the experts say; some solutions are proposed in the last section. An appendix to the publication contains tables showing real spendable average weekly earnings, 1947-1980; United States spending on research and development; growth rate of the real net capital stock; average age of United States equipment and structures, 1925-1980; and cash flow as a percent of Gross National Product.

In order to promote cooperation among various institutions serving the handicapped, the Vocational Rehabilitation/Education Task Force set out to identify and describe for replication exemplary programs in which agency cooperation was working. The Task Force determined that the programs identified should meet the following criteria: (1) be of overall high quality; (2) have exemplary  interagency cooperation and coordination in programming, involving at least special education and vocational rehabilitation, and ideally vocational education also; (3) function at the local level even if there is a statewide system in effect; (4) be replicable; (5) include the severely handicapped; (6) provide a continuum and range of services over the later school years and transition into employment; and (7) serve youth approaching the age for vocational rehabilitation eligibility (13-18). Ten exemplary programs from throughout the country were identified and are described in the main body of this report. The report also presents the legal foundation for cooperative efforts and basic background on curriculum and vocational evaluation based on a literature review of the general problems  of vocational education for the handicapped.

In order to validate the six tests, they were administered to 4,627 tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grade students and job incumbents from a wide cross-section of urban, suburban, and rural locations in Ohio. After computing the Kuder Richardson Formula 20 reliability coefficient for each test to measure its internal consistency, researchers assessed the construct validity of each test through a comparative analysis of the performance levels of the  above-mentioned groups on the six tests. A two-factor analysis of variance design, incorporating academic aptitude as a blocking factor, was then employed to investigate group differences in performance levels on each test. Evidence gathered from the study suggests the reliability of each of the six tests and their subtests and further suggests that they could be valuable tools to be used by administrators and teachers as part of a curriculum analysis and inspection system.

After determining the basic skill competencies needed for students to succeed in marketing and distributive education, project staff identified existing materials in the areas of math and English that could be used in working with disadvantaged students. Then researchers selected the junior marketing and distributive education class in five Jefferson County, Kentucky, high schools to serve as project sites. Using a non-equivalent control group design, researchers field tested the effectiveness of the tutorial approach of instruction in developing basic skill competencies. Among the tutorial strategies utilized were  large group sessions, small group sessions, and individual assistance. Data from student pretest/post-test scores and from responses to a survey (completed by 63 students) indicated that those receiving math and English tutorial services experienced significant gains in mean post-test scores. Because students generally enjoyed working in the project and because the program seemed to give students more confidence in themselves, project staff recommended implementing similar programs in other areas.

Teacher and practitioner responses indicated that the disadvantaged and handicapped are currently offered education and employment in all health occupations areas primarily at basic entry levels. In addition, most of these individuals apply for low or entry-level positions.

The learning process is summarized, and then preplanning procedures are outlined. Discussion of instructional procedures first considers teaching methods--presentation, discussion, job instruction, self teaching, and combinations--and then surveys teaching techniques or procedures used with a method of  teaching. These are described: role playing, demonstrations, resource persons, field trips, lectures, supervised study, problem solving, and tests and inventories. Other topics addressed include using realia; infusing concepts and activities to preserve, extend, and enrich cultural diversity; and parent involvement.

Section 4 first discusses 31 strategies for managing the classroom and laboratory. Facility organization, beginning the year, and problem awareness are briefly addressed. Discussion follows of corrective techniques for use in dealing with misbehavior, including leave it alone, end the action, attend more fully, spell out directions, track the student's progress, withhold reinforcement, use suspense, use individual  conferences, and use volume. Corporal punishment is addressed, and techniques to avoid are described. A table of 20 common discipline situations with three possible solutions each is provided. The final section of the handbook summarizes seven theories of classroom discipline. Each one is described and key ideas and suggestions for implementation are presented. The theories are managing the group; classroom awareness, student accountability, and group management; shaping desired behavior; addressing the situation with sane messages; good behavior comes from good choices; confronting mistaken goals; and assertively taking charge.

The bill authorized federal funds for bilingual vocational training, bilingual vocational instructor training, and the development of instructional materials, methods, and techniques. Witnesses at the hearing testified about what has been accomplished under the bilingual vocational training program since the 1976 amendments to the Vocational Education Act and pointed out problems with  implementing the program and recommendations for improving the authorizing legislation. Witnesses included Ron Hall, acting chief, policy, coordination, and services unit of the Office of Bilingual Education and Minority Affirs of the United States Department of Education; Saul Sibirsky and Jill Kincaid, League of United Latin-American Citizens; and Mary Galvan, educational consultant. Witnesses testified that programs funded through the Act had had a great deal of success in reducing unemployment among program trainees who had little previous knowledge of English. It was felt that further gains could be shown if more selective recruiting procedures, screening out applicants without a sincere desire to work, could be used. Several studies were funded to compare and create training  materials for future use. Witnesses further testified that the use of minority (specifically Hispanic) culture instructors greatly enhanced the success of bilingual vocational programs. They said that the funding for the programs should be continued and that strategies will be employed to make even better use of resources, based on the experience gained since the 1976 reauthorization of the Act.

        "description":"This document is a transcript of a United States House of Representatives hearing conducted in October, 1981, regarding reauthorization of the Vocational Education Act of 1963--specifically the National Institute of Education's study of vocational education mandated by the Education Amendments of 1976. Six principal findings were reported in the NIE study: (1) The ways by which federal funds are distributed to areas and are earmarked to benefit certain groups of individuals are crucial to realizing federal policy objectives; however, states often distribute funds in ways contrary to federal policy because of ambiguous regulations. (2) One of the key objectives of the Vocational Education Act is to assist the states to improve their capacity to provide vocational education  programs and services to students who are handicapped, or disadvantaged, or whose English-speaking proficiency is limited; such legislation has spurred greater services to these students but conflicting regulations may be a disincentive for using federal funds. (3) Overcoming sex bias and stereotyping in vocational education is a new objective of federal policy introduced with the 1976 legislation; sex stereotyping has been reduced but states spend little on sex-fair activities. (4) State plans mandated by the 1976 legislation have not reached its goals and apparently have had little effect on local decisions. (5) Few efforts are made in program improvement. (6) Program evaluation efforts have been considerably augmented under the legislation, but there is room for improvement. It was  concluded that the Act attempts to accomplish too much with too few resources; that there are mismatches between means and ends of federal policy; and that realizing federal policy ends depends on state and local policies, practices, and resources.

        "description":"Servol (Service Volunteered for All) is a voluntary organization in Trinidad and Tobago with a staff of some 90 people engaged in a wide range of activities grouped in seven Life Centers and a periphery of 13 nursery schools, as well as family farm units in a rural area. From a modest start in late 1970, Servol has grown steadily during its first decade, engaging in a variety of projects throughout the country. An advisory mission from the Bernard van Leer Foundation visited Trinidad from October 11-18, 1981, to assess the progress and accomplishments of the Servol program, to appraise the long-term viability of the project, and to advise it on the ways in which the project might develop after the Foundation's involvement has ended. The advisory mission found that Servol is  fostering self-reliance in the communities which it serves; that it is functioning as a change agent to a certain extent, and that its management, although good, has room for greater training for future leaders--all ideals set forth in Servol's mission. As a whole, the mission regards the Servol experience positively. Servol links community development and education into a coherent whole, not only in response to theoretical perception or humanitarian concern but as a translation into reality of the expressed needs and desires of the community. It has had a positive impact on Trinidadian society and beyond in the Caribbean. (KC)",

        "author":["Christensen, Sandra"],
        "description":"At the request of the United States Senate Budget Committee, a study was conducted to analyze present federal programs affecting the youth labor market and to consider a number of alternative options. The study showed that in 1981 the unemployment rate among white youths aged 16-21 was 15 percent, more than twice the average rate for the labor force as a whole; for nonwhite youths, the rate was almost 35 percent. The youth employment problem has two aspects: the difficult transition from school to work, even for youths who are job-ready; and longer term and recurring unemployment for youths who lack basic academic skills, especially the black and poor. Efforts to alleviate the employment problems of young people can seek to increase employment demand for youths; enhance their job  qualifications; or improve their ability to negotiate the transition from school to work or from one job to another. Options for increasing employment demand include stimulating the economy, leaving the minimum wage unchanged, expanding work experience programs, and expanding employment subsidies. Options for enhancing job qualifications include expanding job training programs, and redirecting federal expenditures for secondary education to develop job skills; while options for facilitating labor market transitions are increasing job placement services in high schools and providing job search methods classes. It was noted that long-term job-search skills training programs had a higher rate of long-term job placement success, but were much more expensive to maintain. In keeping with the  mandate of the Congressional Budget Office to provide objective and impartial analysis, the paper offers no recommendations. (KC)",

It is in the national interest to ensure that vocational education programs are of sufficient scope and quality to meet national skilled workforce requirements and alleviate the critical shortages of trained workers facing business, industry, and the Armed Forces. A national human resource policy should be designed to complement a larger policy of economic revitalization and new capital investment. Federal initiative and encouragement is needed not only to coordinate program planning at all government levels but also to ensure a close partnership between vocational education and the private sector. Without federal leadership and commitment another national priority, access to quality  programs for the disadvantaged, handicapped, and other special populations, is also in jeopardy. The Federal Government should allocate more funds to support vocational education and training programs to (1) prepare entry workers, (2) provide skill updating, (3) retrain the unemployed, (4) assist those entering the labor market later in life, and (5) custom train individuals for employment with industries locating in the community. Skills and knowledge developed through these programs should be current, consistent with present and future labor market needs, complementary to national priority needs, and transportable. (YLB)",

        "description":"Analysis of the relationship between employment and crime has been undertaken in several different disciplines. Included among these are economics, sociology, anthropology, and manpower program evaluations for criminal justice populations. Examination of economic perspectives on employment and crime reveals two competing views of their interrelationship. First, there is the view that crime is itself a form of work and that the allocation of time to criminal activity can be modeled on the same formal basis as allocation of time to legal work. On the other hand, the segmented labor market theory explains labor market success through a focus on specific economic groups and on the historical and institutional influences shaping concrete economic arrangements. Among those factors  considered in the anthropological and sociological perspective on employment and crime are the following: family, education, age, subculture, and the social and cultural factors within concrete community settings that determine the kind and extent of opportunities available to youth. Evaluation of such manpower programs as pretrial diversion programs, the Court Employment Project, the Job Corps, supported work programs, and financial aid to released prisoners suggests that more must be learned about specific program processes to enhance future policy formation and program planning.

Using a series of standardized reporting forms as well as telephone and personal interviews with local project directors, evaluators collected data pertaining to 20 local projects carried out in 1979-80 and 17 local projects conducted in 1980-81. They found that a majority of the 1980-81 local career education projects accomplished most of the objectives specified in Tennessee's state plan for career education. Included among the accomplishments were the following: conduct of needs assessments to formulate local project objectives, purchase of instructional and career guidance materials, development of plans to reduce  bias/stereotyping, establishment of resource centers and advisory councils, and collaboration with community organizations. Only in the areas of advisory council meetings and staff awareness sessions did achievement of criterion-referenced objectives fall short of predicted levels. Factors associated with project success and failure were isolated. Among factors contributing to project failure were absence of a project director, failure to conduct needs assessments and evaluations, and insufficient funding. Factors linked to project success included staff development activities, community participation, and early commitment of local funds. (MN)",

Introductory information lists the sessions and the five discussion questions on the agenda at 10 forums. These three general recommendations are then discussed: the youth unemployment problem will not go away or cure itself, long term developmental needs of young people are different from the more immediate job placement needs of adults, and creation of a separate youth title/tier within a consolidated employment and training program is the most effective way to ensure adequate service to youth. Specific recommendations for the discussion questions follow, including (1) targeting to ensure  availability of funds to serve those in greatest need and prescribed eligibility criteria; (2) comprehensive program approaches with a wide range of allowable program activities, local institutional collaboration, and forward funding; (3) expanded private sector involvement; (4) developmental approach to youth programming and performance-based management system; and (5) local control of employment and training programs. Appendixes, amounting to over one-half of the report, include background notes on youth unemployment, network background notes, and questions and answers on Youth Practitioners' Network.

        "description":"A study was conducted to describe factors influencing the acquisition of facilitating and inhibiting reading strategies by adult beginning readers (ABRs) in order to generate potential guidelines for instruction. Using an adapted form of the Goodman and Burke taxonomy of oral reading miscues as initial framework, the investigators described ABRs' reading behavior. In addition, field notes on classroom observations and on interviews with ABRs, teachers, and consultants were considered in discussing the pattern of reading behavior of ABRs. A detailed analysis of the reading and learning-to-read behavior of seven ABRs and general descriptions of the reading behavior of seven more ABRs provided a basis for identifying reading behaviors associated with success and failure. Although  the highly idiosyncratic reading behavior of ABRs and the limited number of teaching situations observed preclude generalizations, the long-term observation of ABRs made it possible to suggest that given reading behaviors promote success or failure in learning to read. Specifically, ABRs who thought of reading as discovering meaning, were aware of when they were not gaining meaning, and had been exposed to syllabication and could manipulate vowels and syllables, tended to make progress. It was also found that ABRs learned more when teachers considered how they wanted to learn as well as what they wanted to learn. In addition, the way a teacher conducts a lesson provides a model for learning; when teachers preceded reading with a discussion of concepts in the text, students tended to read  for meaning. Students' beliefs about reading, perhaps guided by prior schooling, also influenced reading strategies. It was suggested that these findings, along with further research on ABRs' adult development, be considered in designing methods to teach reading to adults. (KC)",

They learn how these occupations relate to personal interest, abilities, skills, educational goals, experiences, and training. They consider the work conditions, salary, and employment outlook for each occupation. Finally, participants use this information to make decisions and plans about the careers they will pursue. This program guide, designed for use by the participants, contains four sections. The Introduction explains  the CAP program and the program materials. It gives the participant explicit instructions on how to begin and proceed through the first phase of the program. Following the Introduction, the Procedure section of the guide gives the participant instructions on how to progress through the program. It tells the participant what to do after he or she has completed work in each occupation. The third section, the Plan, contains information and direction in career decision making and planning. Finally, the fourth section of the guide consists of Reaction Forms which participants use to record their reactions to the tasks or activities they do. They note the things they like and dislike, the things they can and cannot do, and other pertinent information they need for career planning. These  Reaction Forms relate to the 10 basic job functions (and 40 occupational titles) explored in the Job Function Booklets (see note). (KC)",

The booklet contains the following sections: (1) an &quot;explore&quot; section, which describes the working with numbers and symbols job function and introduces the four occupations representative of it; (2) four &quot;perform&quot; sections, which contain work simulation activities related to each of the four occupations (e.g., &quot;imagine you are a library assistant; your task is to help catalog new books for your library&quot;); these activities give participants &quot;hands-on&quot; experience in performing work-related tasks; and (3) four &quot;decide&quot; sections, which provide greater detail  about the occupations and about working conditions, income, and education and experience required. Education and experience activities that can be undertaken by participants are suggested. (KC)",

        "description":"Research on the relationship between sex-role orientation and psychological well-being has been guided by one of three models. The congruence model holds that psychological well-being will be fostered only when one's sex-role orientation is congruent with one's gender; the androgyny model proposes that well-being will be maximized when one's sex-role orientation incorporates a high degree of both masculinity and femininity regardless of one's gender; the masculinity model posits that well-being is a function of the extent to which one has a masculine sex-role orientation. The adequacy of these three models was tested by means of a meta-analysis of 34 studies of the relationship between sex-role orientation and self-esteem, the indicator of psychological well-being most widely  used in sex-role studies. The results of the meta-analysis were most supportive of the masculinity model, and found that the strength of observed relationships between sex-role orientation and self-esteem varied as a function of both the sex-role measure and the type of self-esteem measure used in the studies. The findings indicate that a relationship exists between masculinity and self-esteem in both sexes. (Author/NRB)",

        "description":"Most research examining the relationship between sex role orientation and psychological well-being has been guided by either the congruence, androgyny, or masculinity model. The congruence model predicts that low self-esteem and high depression are consequences of gender/sex role incongruence. The androgyny model predicts that high self-esteem and low depression result from the additive effects of high masculinity and high femininity in both sexes. The masculinity model predicts that high self-esteem and low depression are a result of high masculinity in both sexes. Undergraduates (N=258) completed the Bem Sex Role Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Revised Janis-Field Feelings of Inadequacy Scale. Although sex role self-concept was related to depression, the  process was different for men and women. Path analysis of the data for women strongly supported the masculinity model for women; greater masculinity was associated with high self-esteem and low depression. Results of the path analysis for men partially supported the congruence model; self esteem was maximized and depression minimized when gender and sex role self-concept were congruent. The findings tend to support the general view that depression is related to sex role self-concept as a consequence of the self-concept's influence on self-esteem. (NRB)",

Solutions to this problem are suggested, using an immobile married female psychologist as an example. An adaptation of the \"Twenty Uses\" method, i.e., 20 suggestions for professional growth, are enumerated and discussed. The first 10 suggestions are general ideas, while the last 10 ideas offer more specific activities for either clinical work or academia. It is noted that the \"Twenty Uses\" are useful for any professional woman who has access to the postal service, professional literature, and cooperative colleagues. The method suggested is also helpful for other  professionals, such as the physically disabled, who may be immobile. (NRB)",

A Career Development Center perspective on academic linkages is given which highlights existing alternative routes for obtaining academic credentials.

        "description":"Among the variables contributing to the therapeutic relationship between counselor and client, empathy has received much attention in counseling process research. Most of this research has relied on brief segments as a sampling unit; seldom have these segments been compared with entire counseling sessions. Segments of sessions and entire sessions videotaped by 21 counselors were compared using Carkhuff's measurement of empathy. Thirteen sampling procedures of empathy level were systematically compared with ratings of entire sessions to determine whether the empathy judged from segments was similar to that from entire sessions. Data analyses revealed that, in order to have a reasonable approximation to session-based judgments, a sampling unit should be at least a total of 15  minutes from a 60-minute session, distributed in three segments of five minutes taken in each third of the entire session. A subsequent critical analysis of 48 studies based on a brief segment sampling procedure to measure empathy indicated that only seven studies would have adequate sampling units. The findings suggest that empathy as a broad dimension of counselor relationship qualities may be one aspect of counselor interaction for which sampling units are a difficult substitute for entire sessions.

Objectives of the project are listed and stages used to reach the objectives are explained. The training stage, designed to teach trainees the concepts of awareness, knowledge, and skills through classroom work and in-field experiences, is discussed along with the three graduate seminar courses which comprise the training phase and student participation in field experience. The second stage of the project, the practice phase, is reviewed in terms of its focus on using knowledge  and gaining experience in sharing skills. The implementation of this stage through the development of both research projects and inservice training workshops for mental health agencies is discussed. Examples of DISC research projects are included; the development and implementation of inservice workshops is described in detail. The final phase, evaluation, which measures training outcomes of all DISC activities is presented; methods of participant evaluation are reviewed; and the annual evaluation by the project evaluator, complete with suggestions for change, is described.

To describe the use of volunteers in drug abuse treatment programs, volunteers were studied by a telephone survey of administrators in 123 programs that had at least five volunteers and a single treatment modality, and by in-person interviews with volunteers and paid counselors for 15 programs. The volunteers were classified into three occupational groups, i.e., specialized professionals, counselors, and noncounseling support personnel. The results indicated that: (1) the counselor category had the largest number of volunteers; (2) volunteer professionals were often psychologists or lawyers; (3) activities of volunteer and paid  staff differed in degree rather than kind; (4) drug-free and therapeutic community programs differed in background, type of volunteer, and kind of volunteer activity; and (5) main sources of volunteers were colleges, community organizations, and former clients from a program. The findings indicate a need for more volunteers as well as a pattern of successful programs using volunteers in the field of drug abuse. (NRB)",

Cultural conflict, ethnic identity, and racism are explored in a discussion of an educational needs survey of Latinos. The complete computer search, including annotations of 13 journal articles and abstracts of over 100 documents, is also provided. (NRB)",

        "description":"Physical violence, a factor often associated with drug addiction, must be reduced or eliminated in order for drug dependent individuals to reenter society. To examine the extent to which individual violence associated with drug addiction was controllable by the Odyssey House drug addiction rehabilitation program, the violence potential of 47 residents was investigated through direct observation of the subjects' behaviors for a 6-month period. Results revealed that overt violence was well controlled within the facility, due in part to: (1) strong and unambiguous norms and sanctions; (2) opportunities to acquire self-esteem; (3) non-violent role models; (4) a procedure that enabled wrongs to be righted and conflicts to be resolved; and (5) a social learning process to extinguish  violent behavior. The findings suggest that the Odyssey House program has been remarkably successful. (RC)",

To examine the relationship between personal attributes, psychosocial environmental attributes, and the interaction between these variables, 92 entering college freshmen completed scales measuring social adaptation response patterns, perceptions of social environment and structures of social networks. Both personological and environmental variables tended to predict various, though different, social network variables. Social exploration preference was a useful construct in the examination of social network and adaptation variables. The findings suggest that the formation, structuring, and functioning of  social networks need further examination with a more uniform methodology. (Author/JAC)",

        "description":"Degree of choice or options in language has been posited as being relevant to the psychotherapy process. To investigate the relationship of this concept to the course of therapy and to therapy outcome, 67 15-minute segments from six cases of individual psychotherapy were transcribed and the language of the clients was coded according to variables purported to measure degree of choice or options. Therapy outcome was assessed by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), Goal Attainment Scaling, client ratings, and/or therapist ratings. On the basis of these outcome measures, a global rating of degree of overall improvement was made on each client. Data analyses revealed no significant changes over time in any of the variables in any of the clients. However, ranking of  clients according to overall degree of choice displayed in their language during the course of therapy revealed that significant improvement occurred only in cases where clients displayed the least degree of choice or flexibility in their language. The findings suggest further assessment of the content of instances of the variables and the context within which these instances occur. (Author/JAC)",

        "description":"A major avenue for dissemination of information among members of a profession is via the professional, scholarly literature published in the major journals within a field. If the role of the school psychologist is changing, this change should be reflected in the current literature. An earlier study traced the published issues and concerns appearing in the major school psychology journals from 1963-1973 and classified each article in one of 16 categories as determined by the major theme of the paper. Research articles appearing in five major journals from 1974-1980 were reviewed and placed in one of the 16 categories. A chi-square analysis was used to determine whether years differed in relative distribution of observations across the categories. Spearman's rho correlation  coefficients were calculated for the rank order of categories between each pair of years allowing for comparison of the current data with previous data. Results indicated a significant change in content of articles published over the seven-year period. Articles concerning instrument development and validation accounted for the relatively largest percentage of total articles published in the 1974-1980 period and had continued to increase since the 1967-1973 period. The findings indicate that areas most closely related to psychological testing and referral as well as the proper role and practice of school psychology have increased and tend to dominate the school psychology literature.

This etiological issue was reexamined within a college population. A comprehensive assessment technique, the behavioral-analytic methodology, was used to collect over 1,000 written descriptions of problematic situations by students (N=604) which they reported had resulted in depressive experiences. These situations were reduced by thematic content, rewritten, and administered to a new sample of 312 students. The latter sample rated experience with and individual susceptibility to these situations and then completed the Beck Depression Inventory. Results of discriminant function analyses indicated that heightened susceptibility, in  combination with the experience of particular environmental events, optimally differentiated depressed from nondepressed students. The findings suggest that the application of this methodology to the investigation of such factors in other target populations may have heuristic value. (Author/NRB)",

External barriers include such economic and societal obstacles as age discrimination, rapid technological changes and the shifting demands of the job market. Internal barriers include diminishing job seeking motivation and limited job seeking skills. A conceptual model of job-seeking behavior based on expectancy theory which examines the interplay between internal and external barriers was used to guide a study of 278 job seekers aged 50. To obtain a national probability sample of active job seekers a combination of random digit dialing and multiplicity linkage sampling strategies was used to generate the difficult-to-identify study sample. The preliminary data have indicated that older job  seekers have benefited from enhanced job-seeking skills. A majority of respondents also expressed a willingness to be trained in these skills; even greater numbers expressed interest in training for second careers and for skill upgrading. The findings suggest that further efforts should be directed to the identification of optimal training approaches, the role of group supports in the job search and career change, and the potential contribution of higher education to extending the work-life of older persons.

A discussion of the way in which the internal system of the counselor trainee can provoke burnout concentrates on issues of needs, expectations, and professional philosophy. Three burnout predisposing professional assumptions often held by counselor trainees that must be recognized and evaluated are described, i.e.,: (1) the assumption of personal responsibility for change within a counseling relationship; (2) the judgment of one's own competency for client success or failure; and (3) the assessment of one's self as a totally accountable change agent. Strategies which counselor educators can teach to help trainees recognize how  they contribute to their own burnout, assess their burnout vulnerability, and learn techniques to assist themselves in avoiding burnout are discussed. Techniques such as forming prognoses along with diagnosing client problems, varying the client load, and keeping current through the professional literature and continuing education are included.

The development of the Community Service Society Natural Supports Program (NSP), a project providing services to families caring for frail older relatives in their homes, is discussed before the two outcomes of this project are detailed. The first outcome is described as the formation of a Caregivers Network, a group of informal caregivers who contacted NSP for concrete services, became involved in peer support, and then moved to social action. A parallel development towards social action which occurred among the formal service providers and resulted in the formation of a social action  coalition is also presented. The partnership of this social action coalition with the Caregivers Network is focused on through an explanation of the dependency of this partnership upon mutual goals, a recognition of each other's strengths and skills, and a need for the services of each other to attain goals. The materials emphasize that, under these conditions, a partnership can exist in which both systems rely on each other for strength and validation and retain separate identities and roles.

Although researchers have examined the interrelationship of stress, health, and happiness in old age, stress is usually operationalized as a response to major life events; however, stress can also be operationalized as a response to the everyday experiences of life. Older male veterans (N=24) with a mean age of 76 were interviewed about their background, ways of coping, hassles, anxiety, depression, somatization, locus of control, social supports, perceived health and functional states, affect balance, morale, and problem-solving ability. Data indicated that stress and coping were complexly related to health and happiness. Subjects were in fair to poor health, experienced fairly low stress and  moderate morale. Stress was strongly correlated with low morale and a problem-focused style of coping. For men in good health, stress was unrelated to morale. The healthiest older men used acceptance as a way of coping with stress, a behavioral style that appeared to be acquired over the lifespan. The findings suggest that more competent and well individuals tend to be less affected by their environments. (Author/NRB)",

The two most prominent socio-historical events in the pasts of today's older married persons were the Great Depression of the 1930's and World War II. Older married couples were studied to examine the relative influences of cohort differences and changes associated with number of years married. Instruments measuring love expression and marital problems were completed by 40 couples with 84% retest data obtained two years later. Data were arranged into six cohort groups according to year of marriage. Data analyses indicated cohort effects in areas of unexpressed feelings, money management problems, and consensus of  spouses in identifying marital problems. Self-disclosure, tolerance, and problems focused on children and home labor declined across cohorts. The Depression cohort had the fewest money management problems and the highest degree of problem consensus. Both the Depression and the World War II cohorts had relatively higher levels of unexpressed feelings than other cohorts. The findings suggest that both generational and aging influences are important for understanding the nature of marital relationships in the later years. (Author/NRB)",

Other findings are reported from a survey sample, (N=18,000) representative of students, parents, teachers, principals, counselors, trustees, employers, and Alberta Education Officials and central office administrators,  who rated the importance of various services provided by school guidance and counseling programs. An index of adequacy computed for all services and all schools is presented and school visitation data are discussed. Conclusions about the adequacy and quality of services are given along with 23 recommendations of the task force. The appendices contain survey forms and responses, background papers, letters, interview forms, data collection forms, average adequacy indices, and services rated as shared and school responsibilities.

        "description":"Organizations are directly influenced by the beliefs and values of the employees. Many of these beliefs deal with the meaning of work and preferences for broad classes of work outcomes. A heterogeneous sample of working people (N=318) completed a questionnaire which examined beliefs about work on nine job-related dimensions that distinguish four beliefs systems. A cluster analysis performed on the nine job-related subscale scores indicated that there were five clusters of people who differed in their beliefs about work. A comparison of the means of the five clusters on the subscales revealed that: (1) Cluster 1 tended to hold Protestant Ethic beliefs; (2) Cluster 2 adhered to the Leisure Ethic; (3) Cluster 3 was neutral relative to the other groups on almost all scales; (4)  Cluster 4 endorsed more Marxist beliefs than other clusters; and (5) Cluster 5 held a combination of Protestant Ethic and Humanistic beliefs. For most clusters, beliefs from more than one ethic were held. These data suggest that the theory-based work beliefs scale is a superior instrument for measuring the beliefs of workers.

The families of 198 fourth, fifth, and sixth grade students were asked to complete television and reading logs for four weeks. Sixty-six students were identified from this sample as representing either the upper or the lower quartiles in terms of their leisure reading behavior (number of books read per month) or their television viewing habits (number of hours watched per week). Four groups emerged in the following categories: (1) heavy viewing/heavy reading, (2) light viewing/heavy reading, (3) light viewing/light reading, and (4) heavy viewing/light reading. The quality of the leisure reading choices for each of the  four groups was analyzed using a modification of the W. F. Gray and B. Rogers Maturity in Reading Scale. The results indicated that students in the fourth group, heavy viewing/light reading, tended to choose books of lower quality than the other groups. (Author/HTH)",

An implementation model was developed to allow maximum impact of the program, in which the school principal models sustained silent reading and sustained writing in the classrooms and designs schedules to allow frequent teacher team meetings and inservice sessions. In providing the four critical experiences for students, teachers focus on facilitating student learning, with the belief that teachers can positively affect  the learning of their students. Assessment of the reading and writing achievement in pilot PCRP classes at the elementary school level indicates significant gains in both areas, and subsequent research will be conducted with PCRP students at the secondary school level. Current results indicate positive effects for implementation of PCRP, but the most convincing evidence that the program has made a difference for students is the teachers' growth in reading, writing, speaking, and listening when working with their students in this approach.

In this situation the hypothetical secondary school reading teacher came from an English major background, had 15 years experience teaching reading and English, subscribed to several professional journals, attended research sessions at regional conferences, and had had a few graduate courses in statistics. &quot;The Journal of Reading&quot; was chosen in order to gain insight into the nature of a research article in a nonresearch oriented journal. Another reason for the choice was its focus on secondary reading. The high school reading teacher perspective was chosen because reading educators and psychologists  who write and submit research articles to the journal, as well as the editors and reviewers for the journal, need to know how a classroom teacher might react to these articles.

The subjects were administered standardized reading achievement tests and tests of language knowledge. Six samples of peer interaction were videotaped in seven homogeneous reading groups in  the fall and spring of one school year. The results showed that the ability groups differed in reading achievement, and that these differences remained stable throughout the year. In addition, the groups were found to differ in their requests and responses, and these differences also remained stable over the year. Finally, certain aspects of requests did predict obtaining appropriate responses. It was concluded that the quality of interaction in peer-directed reading groups of different ability levels varies through the children's use of language. (FL)",

Subjects were 144 fifth grade students with either high or low levels of vocabulary knowledge who were randomly assigned either to one of three keyword instructional conditions that varied in the degree of structure provided or to a no-strategy control condition. All subjects were asked to learn 16 new vocabulary words. Results showed that all three variations of the keyword method facilitated students'  vocabulary learning. However, aptitude-by-treatment interactions involving vocabulary knowledge materialized in such a way that the degree of keyword structure made far less difference for the high knowledge students than it did for the low knowledge subjects. In particular, when the students had to execute the dual components of the keyword method entirely on their own, low vocabulary knowledge students experienced considerably more difficulty than did the high knowledge students.

Many teachers and administrators are uncomfortable with computer technology and are uncertain about its ability to benefit school programs.

The children were administered the reading comprehension subtest of a standardized achievement test, five subtests on an intelligence measure, and a battery of reading skills tasks. A preliminary analysis of the results indicated no substantial or statistically reliable correlations between scores on the general comprehension measure and any of the skill measures. This finding suggests that there are many different specific skills on which a precocious reader can draw in such a testing situation; thus no one skill would be associated with success on the comprehension measure. The possiblity of identifying  separable sets of top-down and bottom-up reading skills in precocious readers was reduced by the relatively high correlations between the two sets of measures. The data suggest, however, that precocious readers may be more flexible than less able readers in capitalizing on skills that are well developed in order to compensate for areas of relative weakness.

        "description":"Remedial readers may be given opportunities to be creative through three approaches: inventiveness games, branched fiction, and pantomime and creative dramatics. Inventiveness games can stimulate creative thinking and serve as a launching pad for creative writing activities. In branched fiction, the story works up to a cliffhanger situation and then offers the remedial reader choices about how the story will continue. The reader controls the plot and creates the story by the choices available. Branched stories also have a positive effect on the attention, interest, and comprehension of remedial readers. Their format promotes creative reading. Pantomime practice enables the readers to develop their powers of creativity, to use body English for projecting certain ideas, to gain  confidence about doing things in front of a group, and to \"act out\" new words. The use of popular ballads in creative dramatics offers remedial readers an opportunity to listen to the words, read along, and act out the story. They are then ready to write their dramas based on the ballad and, in accordance with the language experience approach, they can read what they have written. (Various activities are presented under each of the approaches discussed.) (HOD)",

Following a definition of causality, including the features deemed necessary for judging the existence of a causal relation between two events, a general model for comprehension and inferences of relation between events is sketched. The application of this analysis to stories is then illustrated on a set of data used by N. Stein and C. Glenn in their 1979 study of children's comprehension and recall. The data show striking linear relations between  degree of recall and the percentage of story events in the causal chain, thereby supporting the argument that memorability of a story depends upon causal cohesion among events.

Subjects were 91 elementary school students, representing a range of reading abilities. The students completed word recognition and passage comprehension tests and then individually read passages from each of the ten reading levels in the Ginn 720 and the nine levels of the Scott-Foresman Unlimited reading series. Correlational and congruency  analyses of the resulting data supported the validity of the 95% word recognition accuracy standard, but raised questions about the reliability and validity of the passage sampling procedures and the use of one-level floors and ceilings of performance. The findings suggest that IRI procedures for selecting passages from basal readers and for sampling students' performance at instructional levels may have a negative effect on educational practice. Sampling over time and test forms is a more valid IRI procedure. (FL)",

Fifteen elementary school teachers were divided into three groups and trained for 40 hours by three different preceptors using differing approaches to the same model of reading. Each group gained experience in dealing with either real cases, simulated cases, or both, with instructor feedback, and each was instructed in the use of decision aids to guide interaction in the simulated cases. Student progress was monitored by means of a pretest, midtest, and posttest on a simulated case, and an additional posttest on a case not previously diagnosed. The students diagnosed the cases using a structured form and  transferred their diagnoses to a checklist. Statistics were then run on agreement between each student and his or her preceptor, agreement among the students, and agreement among the preceptors. Results showed that student agreement with preceptor and with other students increased in all aspects of a diagnosis; however, transfer of skills to a new case was questionable.

Early attempts to evaluate developmental programs in Georgia simply used standard survey techniques to discover the range of procedures, criteria, and designs, including the sorts of program evaluations each institution used. The first quarterly report was mailed to each institution in 1974, and was designed to provide information about the population served by the developmental program and whether the program was working. In 1975, questions were devised to measure the success of developmental studies students in subsequent coursework. Each  institution was asked to compare the success rates and grade point averages of former developmental studies students and regularly placed freshmen in English, mathematics, and social science classes. Across the 33 institutions in the state, the entire developmental studies program is apparently working well, with 50 to 60% of the students completing their work and moving into freshman credit courses.

Acknowledging this, a study was conducted to examine the comparability of writing competency profiles derived from test tasks differing in discourse and response mode. Two hundred high school students were given a multiple choice test and a paragraph writing task, as well as two full-length essay assignments. Ratings of the essays and paragraph on an analytic scale and scores on the objective test provided the bases for comparisons. Results indicated that levels of  performance varied on tasks presenting different writing purposes. Also shown was that repeated applications of the scoring rubric produced measures that taped the same underlying content.

The first theory views written language as a derivative of oral language and as an alternate but parallel form of oral language. The pedagogical implications of this model suggest that the problems of comprehension and composition are essentially the same for the reader and writer as for the listener and speaker. The second theory views written language as qualitatively different from oral language, differing both in its origins and in its purposes. According to this theory, writing, while initially dependent upon oral language while children learn to decode and encode written language, becomes increasingly less dependent on oral language  and more influenced by written language itself. The theory seems to suggest that students' writing may gradually become more like the language they read, with continuous experience and instruction in reading and writing this language. The fact that poor writing is often poor precisely because it reflects the patterns, structures, and lexicon of poor oral language would suggest that composition instruction based on the first theory that views academic writing as a derivative of oral language is ill-advised.

In the solo mode, the program prompts students to perceive what they have seen--that is, to consider the literary work in an active way. The program also remembers--like an elephant--what the students say in answer to the program's prompts. In the network mode, students can share their work and get feedback by seeing how their work compares with others' views or by getting other students' comments on their work. In a tutorial that is currently being set up for a character analysis, the solo mode prompts students to provide and consider evidence in support of their own hypothesis, while the network segment  is designed to help the students sharpen their critical insights by giving and getting feedback. In the fall of 1981 the program was tested on students in an introductory world literature class to determine if the students would improve their essay writing after using the computer program. A preliminary analysis of the data suggests that the improvement between the computer group and the noncomputer group is not statistically significant. However, the writing of the computer group did become much longer and more detailed, while failing and marginal students seemed to improve on the essay exam quite dramatically. (HOD)",

Instructors interested in tapping this market should watch for opportunities and not overlook small or unusual jobs. They should also clarify their goals, start small, and remember the audience. Clear goals can help the instructor focus his or her effort on a specific result, such as improving the readability of legal writing, while starting at a small job allows the teacher to build experience in a new field. Remembering the audience is critical because those professionals in the writing course want their writing to be accurate, persuasive, and impressive, and the goals of these &quot;students&quot; may not be the same as those of an  English teacher in a traditional classroom. Writing instructors should consider five factors before teaching writing to professionals: (1) interest in the discipline in which they would be teaching, (2) the professional jargon of the new discipline, (3) efficiency over and above perfection, (4) ability to maintain a moderately relaxed attitude, and (5) isolation from professional peers. Writing instructors who think these factors would be enjoyable or a challenge may want to add the teaching of writing to members of other professions to their repertoire of marketable skills. (HTH)",

Success in the conference can be connected both to its structure (who can talk when and how much, and what types of talk are sequenced in what ways) and to the content within that structure (what topics are discussed, the amount of collaboration between student and teacher in sustaining topics, and so on). In one study of such conferences, tape recorded conversations between one teacher and four students were analyzed for content and structure. The analysis of the first introductory conference revealed that the conferences were teacher controlled and centered around a discussion of the student's past experiences with writing and a review of the student's first writing sample. The  substantive topic that the teacher initiated most frequently differed for the stronger students and weaker students and differed according to ethnic group. For the stronger students, most of the teacher-initiated talk centered around idea development. For the weaker students, talk centered around mechanics, revision, and issues of strategy. Another interesting difference in the topics of conversation was affective. The teacher spent a great deal of time praising the stronger students and very little time, if any, praising the weaker students. Stronger students knew how to initiate praise, but the weaker students behaved and spoke in a manner that might have alienated the teacher. (HOD)",

However, when the pair suggests a relationship that is not a part of the intended communication, the writer must alert the reader, so some punctuation is necessary. When members of an adjacent pair do not suggest a plausible semantic relationship, the reader will try to associate the second word of the pair with an earlier element in the discourse. In cases where a more distant association does not exist, the reader must be prevented from looking for one by means of punctuation. The relevant factor in the choice between a comma and a period is the presence or absence of a lexically suggested relationship between nonadjacent words. If there is a lexical  relationship between nonadjacent items, a comma is chosen. A period will be chosen where there are no lexical relationships between any two meanings on either side of the point at which punctuation is called for. Students whose writing is characterized by fragments and run-on sentences have difficulty in discerning lexical relationships. Consequently, remediation that concentrates on developing sentence skills such as analysis into subject and predicate has met with only mixed success. Remediation should concentrate on developing skills at the word level, heightening the students' awareness of the lexical relations implied by the meanings of individual words. (HOD)",

        "description":"With evidence supporting the belief that as a way of decreasing errors sentence combining offers a number of advantages for developmental writing students, a college composition instructor gave 19 developmental writing students five weeks of concentrated sentence combining study with no other instruction or writing practice. The sessions concentrated on the structures used in the students' placement essays, and punctuation was integrated into the teaching of each structure. During the first week of the class, students completed a series of exercises, two of which were paragraphs composed by the students and two of which were prepared exercises. The passages were evaluated according to four main categories: garbled construction, sentence boundary errors, comma errors, and  semicolon errors. At the end of the sessions, the initial exercises were returned to the students to proofread and revise according to the techniques they had studied. They also wrote a paragraph with the same instructions as one of the two earlier writing assignments. The results of the proofreading were positive, with a decline in all kinds of errors, particularly in garbled sentences. To determine whether this proofreading ability had carried over to their writing, the pretest and posttest writing samples were compared, showing a similar reduction in errors and indicating that sentence combining can be an incisive proofreading tool for the developmental writer.

        "description":"The effectiveness of the freshman composition &quot;reader&quot; as a source of prose models for student essays is questionable because their often long and complicated rhetorical strategies and ideas can intimidate the writers. The narrow expository patterns offered in the readers can also reduce essay writing to a matter of copying a prescribed organizational pattern, drawing attention away from consideration of persona, audience, and purpose, thus restricting the student's inventiveness. The greatest drawback of such models is their fundamental inability to illustrate the process of writing. Unfortunately, the writing process probably cannot be demonstrated fully and effectively in any form except the actual practice of writing. Despite these drawbacks, freshmen readers can be  productive in the composition course. Students can keep journals of their responses to the passages as a prewriting technique. The instructor can then gradually steer the journal writing away from expressive and toward referential prose, including abstracts of essays and discussions or refutations of a passage's main point. The readers can still be used for direct imitation, but this should be introduced much later in the course, in conjunction with a discussion on style, and only after the less restrictive use of prose models has been explored in some detail.

        "description":"Endeavoring to combat the persistent problems of low achievement, poor reading skills, and nagging absenteeism, the Intermountain Inter-Tribal High School, an American Indian boarding school in Utah, developed a project whose primary mission was to reduce substantially the number of students scoring below the acceptable norm in grade equivalency on oral language skills. The preliminary phase of the project, conducted during the 1981-82 school year, collected the following data on student learning needs: test scores from the Oral Language Test of the Southwest Cooperative Educational Laboratory, test scores from the California Achievement Test, and student perception scores of their own native language speaking and understanding ability and of their English speaking and  understanding ability. Analyses of scores produced the following preliminary findings: (1) most students admitted to the oral language project really were deficient in language skills (many of those in the ninth grade tested at sixth grade reading levels); (2) there was a positive correlation between student reading level, overall language ability, and oral language proficiency; and (3) most students were moderately proficient in their native language, with some indications of language interference problems due to the learning of English.

The essays by the architectural students were reread, using Diederich's analytic scale, which is based on the following criteria: idea and organization, flavor, usage, punctuation, and handwriting. Results showed that some of the students could not organize their thoughts well, but that more of them tried to express their ideas without adequate support or coherence or just didn't know what  to say, while the largest number of students lacked control of the language. Failure rate was also attributed to (1) ineligibility (based on the WEPT scores), (2) failure in or lack of writing courses, (3) a nonnative language background, (4) sex, and (5) cognitive style.

Next the paper discusses the advantages of conducting experimental research, some of which are that it (1) encourages careful planning, close attention to classroom procedures, and systematic evaluation; (2) is a better test of the effectiveness of teaching methods; and (3) promotes a clearer understanding of research methodology. Finally, the paper illustrates these advantages by summarizing a \"true\" experiment (one whose components are an hypothesis, assumptions, a research design, randomized subjects, a treatment, and a  measurement procedure) to learn whether dictation/word processing systems required a composing process somewhat different from that of writing.

The guidelines are based on the assumptions that faculties are aware of their own teaching needs, that the best inservice comes from teachers who can effectively demonstrate their successful techniques, that writing should be integrated with all subject areas, and that both teachers and students must master the writing processes (prewriting, drafting, and revising). Emanating from these assumptions, the ten steps for inservice program development include the following: (1) enlisting administrative support, (2) soliciting teachers as presenters/participants, (3) compiling a writing bibliography to which  program participants can refer, (4) collecting effective teaching ideas from participants and sequencing them according to topic areas within the writing process, (5) scheduling workshop sessions based on the sequential list from step 4, and (6) having participating teachers prepare and present their ideas within a &quot;Do-Look-Learn&quot; approach to inservice education. The &quot;Do-Look-Learn&quot; method is explained and resources are suggested concerning prewriting, drafting, revising, teaching mechanics, grading, small group work, the teacher's role, writing in the content areas, and sequencing writing.

In the first study, 666 fourth and fifth grade children (Chicanos, blacks, Asians, American Indians, and Anglos) viewed a composite episode of the American Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC) Saturday morning &quot;Superfriends&quot; cartoon series, and answered questions about their opinions of the minority characters in the show to determine minority children's identification with minority characters. The usual pattern of identification by minority children with majority characters rather than with characters from their own group was nearly significant among Asians and highly significant among Chicano children, but black children identified with the black&quot;Superfriends&quot; character more than with the comparable Anglo character. In the second study, which focused on interracial attitude change associated with exposure to a Public Broadcasting System (PBS) multicultural series about Indochinese children, 472 children in grades three through six were pretested to determine their racial attitudes. The children then viewed the pilot episode of the series, and were posttested to determine an attitude change. The results indicated significant positive changes in racial attitudes toward Indochinese children. The results of both studies indicate that it is possible to create minority television characters capable of establishing identification with minority children and of positively affecting the interracial attitudes of other viewers.

The RHETSEN scale characterizes communication attitudes according to three communicator types: (1) the &quot;rhetorically sensitive&quot; (RS) person, who generally accepts the variability of communication and interpersonal relationships and does not try to avoid stylized verbal behaviors; (2) the &quot;noble self&quot; (NS), who sees any variat ion from personal norms as hypocritical and a denial of integrity; and (3) the &quot;rhetorical reflector&quot; (RR), who presents a different self for each person or situation. The Communicator Style Measure examines style along dominant, dramatic,  contentious, animated, impression leaving, relaxed, attentive, open, and friendly dimensions. In examining the relationships between the three components of the RHETSEN measure and the nine components of the Communicator Style Measure, it was found that persons who scored high on the RS scale tended to see themselves as being less animated, relaxed, and impression leaving than others. Persons who scored high on the NS scale, on the other hand, tended to see themselves as being more dramatic, impression leaving, and attentive. The RR attitude was not associated with any general style of communication. (RL)",

In this light, a study was conducted to examine the attitudes of college students toward motion pictures. Subjects were asked to complete a questionnaire about their movie attendance and attitudes. For purposes of analysis, the 170 respondents were placed into one of two  attendance groups: occasional movie goers (attending one movie per month or less) and frequent movie goers (attending more than one movie per month). A composite movie attitude index was constructed to assess the sample's overall attitudinal disposition toward motion pictures. Consistent with previous research findings, males were found to hold a more favorable attitude toward movies and to attend them more frequently than females. Contrary to all previous research, the subjects in the present study were found to hold a somewhat unfavorable attitude toward movies, which parallels the decline in movie admissions over the years.

Specific reasons for the movie industry's own inattention to audience research include the early popularity of films and the fact that since the industry does not sell advertising it does not need to account for its audience size and preferences. Some researchers suggest that the artistic nature of film making and the industry's mistrust of researchers also account for the shortage. The fact that little audience research has been conducted by independent scholars and social scientists can be traced to at least six factors: (1) the notorious difficulty of access to facts about the secretive and insular film industry, (2) researchers' agreement with the film industry's assumption that each film  presents a new problem and cannot be considered a typical product, (3) the difficulty or inability to attract funding for such work, (4) the vulgar associations attached to the newness and popularity of the cinema, (5) the feeling that what little there is to be said on the sociology of cinema is trite or well known, and (6) widespread research attention directed at television at the expense of movie research. Whatever the reasons for this shortage, and these suggested are not conclusive, there is clearly a need for such research in the areas of antecedent conditions to movie attendance, contexts of the movie experience, public preferences for movie genres, and attitudes toward motion pictures.

        "description":"A study examined the relationship between self-reported communication apprehension and psychological sex type as measured by the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI). The BSRI identifies people as masculine (high in masculinity, low in feminity), feminine (high in femininity, low in masculinity), androgynous (high in both femininity and masculinity), and undifferentiated (low in both femininity and masculinity). Subjects were 232 college students who completed the self report measures. Regression analyses of the data illustrated the usefulness of replacing the four-part matrix classification of the BSRI with other factors that emerge from the instrument. As hypothesized, leadership and incisiveness were factors demonstrated to have an inverse relationship to communication apprehension.  On the other hand, there was no apparent relationship demonstrated between communication apprehension and self-reported masculinity/femininity, empathy, diplomacy, or biological sex. (RL)",

        "description":"A study examined the effects of conversational themes and attention-focusing strategies on conversational comprehension. The variables in the study were (1) the presentation of ambiguous versus unambiguous themes of conversations, (2) using personal versus content-oriented themes in conversations, and (3) presenting listeners with personal versus content attention-focusing strategies (asking participants to focus on a personality type versus focusing on the content of the message). The subjects were 247 college students who were divided into 16 groups that heard various combinations of the three variables and two stimulus messages. After the subjects received the attention-focusing strategy and theme statement appropriate to their experimental group, they listened to the stimulus  conversation and completed recall accuracy and uncertainty reduction tests. The posttests were administered again one week following the experiment. The results demonstrated that unambiguous themes predicted conversational comprehensibility and recall accuracy. Type of theme also had a significant impact on these dependent measures as well as on uncertainty reduction. The results suggested that personal conversational information may be processed differently from content conversational information. (RL)",

        "description":"Reactance theory predicts that when a behavioral freedom is restricted or eliminated an individual is motivationally aroused to restore that freedom. This theory served as the basis of a study that investigated whether motion picture ratings, specifically R and X ratings, acted as a source of reactance arousal for high school students. Subjects were 130 high school freshmen and seniors who were asked to indicate their likelihood of attending each of four different fictional films based on a film plot synopsis given to them on a single page. In addition to a plot summary, the page also provided information about the director, producer, screenwriter, and actors in the movie. Each also contained a notice of the film's rating. The experimental condition consisted of manipulating the  rating over the four synopses. The students also completed self-report instruments and a questionnaire concerning their actual movie attendance patterns and eliciting demographic information. The results indicated only limited support for the reactance theory. Significant differences in likelihood of attendance were found for the sample as a whole and among students under 17 years of age. Data from the self-report measures and questionnaire showed that the subjects preferred movies with PG or R ratings. (FL)",

The subjects of the recommended changes range widely from special education rules for identifying gifted students to physical education regulations affecting all students, from planning requirements for school construction to procedures for suspending disruptive students, and from the reporting of student attendance to the furlough of professional  employees. Each mandate analyzed was singled out as unnecessarily costly or overly restrictive by school superintendents, school board presidents, or both. Twenty-one burdensome mandates are identified in this report; for each mandate the document includes a statement of the problem, the statutory source of the mandate, mechanisms for change, a discussion, and a recommendation for relief.

        "description":"Student transfers from school to school at the elementary and secondary levels have been increasing for many decades. A proposed typology of major school transfer flows distinguishes between \"systemic\" transfers, caused by changes in school structures, and \"individualistic\" transfers, caused by family or individual changes. Within this typology, transfers can be further analyzed by their origins, timing in the school year, severity of student or community responses, and the nature of school programs for new students. Current theories on transfers, drawn from the fields of social organization and social and individual psychology, fail to address the full array of conditions affecting school transfers. Similarly, a review of research literature on student responses to transfers,  and on the effects of transfers on students of different ages, reveals an absolute lack of research as well as design deficiencies and inconsistent results in the existing research. Moreover, little information has been gathered on school practices for handling school transfers. Based on the typology and on these criticisms of current knowledge, a research model is proposed that combines individual and background factors, transfer characteristics, school and community characteristics, school programs for transfer students, and student adjustment responses.

        "description":"To examine the problem of widening gaps in reading achievement between initially low-achieving children and other students as they move through elementary school, the authors first reviewed the literature on school effectiveness. Using a form of systems analysis called &quot;system dynamics,&quot; they formulated a model and a set of hypotheses explaining the differences between effective and ineffective schools. Among the variables included are teacher skills and expectations, time factors, instructional intensity and appropriateness, principals' intervention and support, class size, feedback between reading achievement and teacher perceptions of a learning gap, and student behavior, motivation, and aptitude. A survey of educational practitioners' reactions led to adjustments in the  model. The authors then constructed a mathematical computer simulation of the model, showing the flow of students through grades 1-6, to test the hypotheses and to evaluate four possible school improvement policies that involve changes in school characteristics, instructional intensity and appropriateness, or student behavior. Based on their results, the authors conclude that ineffective schools can be made effective by increasing teacher skills, raising teacher expectations, and maximizing instructional time.

The hypotheses tested suggest that, in districts whose reduction-in-force (RIF) policies include performance evaluations as well as seniority as criteria for dismissal, teachers facing imminent dismissal will seek greater participation in school decision-making because such RIF policies would increase teachers' uncertainty. This will be especially true, the hypotheses propose, when teachers have less contact with supervisors or principals. The survey gathered data on district enrollment changes and RIF criteria and on teacher age, sex, educational background, contact with  administrators, and preferences for participation in school decision-making. Examination of the survey results using analysis of variance revealed little support for the hypotheses. Districts with quite different RIF criteria and enrollment declines showed only small differences in teacher preferences for decision-making participation. However, further evidence is being gathered to trace longitudinal changes as enrollment declines deepen and RIFs increase. (RW)",

The two surveys covered 1,697 teachers and 880 students in the fall and 1,442 of those teachers and all the same  students the following spring. Analysis of the coupling variables using measures of central tendency indicated the schools were loosely coupled. Correlation coefficients showed significant, positive correlations between the coupling variables and the measures of school effectiveness.

Assistance in this context means provision of legal or program knowledge needed to operate successful programs. Enforcement means monitoring of programs to make sure regulations or mandates are being carried out. The research project asked two questions: Do individuals who play enforcement or assistance roles feel comfortable combining the two? and, Can the two roles successfully be combined? Data were collected from intermediate units in Pennsylvania and educational improvement centers and county offices of New Jersey. Data were collected through site  visits incorporating questionnaires and interviews. Findings indicate that those charged with enforcement responsibility would also like to provide assistance. There are important limitations, however, to the kinds of assistance they can provide. They can link districts to sources of training and specialized assistance but they cannot provide these services themselves because of time constrictions and because local educators seem unwilling to utilize assistance from individuals who also have monitoring responsibilities.

        "description":"Assessing school administrator training involves comparing what administrators do with what they are trained to do in university preservice programs and non-university inservice programs. Research on educational administrators shows their work activities are brief, discontinuous, unpredictable, verbal, and generally unrelated to school instruction or curriculum. University preservice programs for administrators are fairly uniform and offer only limited field experience. Little research has been done to evaluate these university programs; however, scholars' observations and the comments from practicing school administrators indicate that preservice training fails to prepare administrators to make quick decisions, communicate effectively, and deal with value-laden issues. These  criticisms suggest that administrator preparation must include both cognitive and technical skills. Presently, educational administrators acquire technical skills through inservice programs that augment or replace graduate training; these include nonresidential graduate programs, various clinical training strategies, and inservice education. The inservice programs all relate to specific job content, match problems with solutions, and favor peer communication. Deciding the content of preservice or inservice training involves identifying the knowledge or skills needed, specifying the scope and sequence of the training, and determining the people and programs responsible for each segment of the training content.

        "description":"The Attorney General was directed by Congress to prepare a report on whether the United States could recover, from any persons determined liable, the amounts expended to detect, contain, or remove hazardous asbestos products from schools. The general background portion of this report contains the results of the factual research and investigation. It briefly sets forth some of the uses of asbestos and describes the asbestos industry and the diseases attributed to inhalation of asbestos fibers--asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma. This section also explores documents that indicate industry knowledge of the dangers of asbestos fibers as early as the 1930s. Asbestos problems in the schools are discussed and suits already filed by two school districts are described. The legal  issues portion of the report commences with a summary of the problems of duty, breach of duty, injury, limitations, and economic loss. Equitable and common law theories of recovery and the potential liability of parties other than asbestos manufacturers are discussed. The report concludes that litigation by school authorities, rather than by the federal government, should be quickly investigated as one potential means of reducing the fiscal impact on taxpayers of abating asbestos hazards in the schools.

This study focuses on one of these questions, the problem of state agencies' responsibility for the evaluation, governance, planning, and monitoring of programs providing public funds to nonpublic schools. The authors describe New Jersey's provision of compensatory education and handicapped services to nonpublic schools. They identify the problems involved, including the legal basis for state evaluation of the programs and the implementation, management, delivery, and effectiveness of the services. Data were gathered through classroom observation, surveys of 90 local educational agencies and 201 students, and  interviews with 62 public and nonpublic administrators, 42 public school teachers, and 29 parents. The study results indicate, among other things, that the services are delivered to nonpublic students by countywide agencies, school district consortia, or individual districts, and that the students served have improved their achievement levels because of the services. A profile of the services provided to nonpublic schools by a typical district is included. (RW)",

For this second-year evaluation, researchers associated with the University of Tennessee collected data for the evaluation of program components. Formative evaluation concerned expansion grants, youth advisory councils, student involvement, contract negotiations, NET materials, and competency workshops. Summative evaluation was focused in three areas: (1) site visits to pilot projects using NET program development grants to improve nutrition education for children; (2) post-workshop assessments of 1980 Nutrition Education Summer Workshops; and (3) collection of comparative  data concerning nutrition knowledge, attitudes, behavior, and perceptions from a statewide sample of Tennessee public school students, parents, teachers, principals, and food service personnel. A pretest-posttest comparison group design was used to assess the effectiveness of the instructional plan in promoting student learning related to the objectives. The assessment instruments were administered to more than 7,000 students in 36 elementary schools located throughout the state. Assessments are included. (Author/MLF)",

An introductory overview summarizes fiscal 1982 appropriations and gives data on school finances and enrollment from 1966 to 1982. Chapter one lists and briefly describes state education programs funded by the state common school fund as well as 37 categorically funded programs. Similar information for over 30 federally funded programs is presented in chapter two. Chapter three discusses 34 state laws affecting  property taxes and school district accounting. In chapter four the authors review legislation on school management practices, including tax rate limitations, interfund transfers, and short- and long-term borrowing. The final chapter covers the activities of the Illinois Financial Accounting Committee, an advisory body established to help improve school district financial procedures. Six appendices provide a bibliography, a glossary, a sample state aid claim, and graphs on state aid to districts of varying wealth. (Author/RW)",

The researchers gathered qualitative data on 14 elementary, junior high, and high schools in a variety of urban, suburban, and rural settings during a two-year period after the implementation of instructional changes. Using fieldwork methods that included observation and formal and informal interviews, they examined the nature of the implementation, the school factors or contingencies, critical post-implementation events, and the continuation status of the  changes. Their data indicate that the most important factors promoting continuation are teacher incentives (from administrators, other teachers, and students) for making the changes, revision of the curriculum guide and other school rules governing instructional behavior, and assessments of the effectiveness of the changes.

The administrators were surveyed during the workshops and four years later. Data were gathered on age, ethnicity, marital status, children, present position, educational background, job experiences and skills, future aspirations, reference letters, clarity of resume expression, opportunities to make presentations, barriers encountered, and strategies used to overcome barriers. Analysis using  descriptive statistics, t-tests, and regression indicates that the AASA training decreased trainees' external barriers (such as lack of sponsors) but also led 22 percent of the trainees to switch out of school administration. It was also found that clarity of expression and job experience were related to career growth and that women with good reference letters and fewer internal barriers tended to become superintendents. The authors recommend further support from AASA and similar organizations for women administrators and provision of training to women just starting in education. (RW)",

Principal style was defined as the principal's orientation toward relationships or toward task accomplishment. Situational favorableness comprised the principal's authority or power position, school leader-member relations, and the structure of school tasks. Data on these factors were gathered from surveys of 98 principals and 728 teachers and from  test scores on 2,999 students. Statistical analysis using regressions, correlations, and t-tests failed to support Fiedler's hypothesis but did indicate, among other things, that good leader-member relations and strong principal power position correlated highly with teacher satisfaction and high scores on one of the national tests.

Evaluation of the course included tests of participants' ego development  immediately before and after the workshops, surveys of career goals and job status during and one and two years after the workshops, and participants' written evaluations of the course.

A renewing school was described as solving its own problems and having a continuous process of improvement based on staff-designed alternatives. Thirty-eight schools from the Goodlad study were first characterized as more or less renewing by determining whether teachers identified problems and whether effective solutions were implemented. A number of contextual variables were identified and discriminant analysis was done. Among the demographic or personal variables, professionalism, age, and educational attainment of teachers had the highest loading coefficients (accounting, however, for only six percent of the variance). Six  school-focused variables, the most powerful subset of variables, appeared to differentiate more or less renewing schools; these included &quot;take care of business&quot; (a generalized measure of ability to solve problems, meet the needs of individuals, and achieve goals in the school), adequacy of resources, principal leadership, staff cohesiveness, chances for successful solution of school problems, and adequacy of teacher assistance. Class or curriculum focused variables, including teachers' rating of the school and teacher influence over curriculum, instruction, and behavior, also differentiated more and less renewing schools.

Management of such a large-scale assessment requires the development of a structure for the organization; distribution and recovery of large quantities of materials; the hiring, training, and supervision of part-time temporary assistants to administer the assessment; and scheduling and supervision in a natural setting. Three elements of the model are critical to its implementation. The first is the development of a leadership framework (to establish and clarify lines of responsibility among members of the assessment staff). The second is construction of an activity timeline (containing personnel  assignments and target dates for completion). The third element is a structured procedure for the recruitment, interviewing, selection, and training of field assistants (including determining job qualifications, formulating screening instruments and interview questions, and developing a handbook for field assistants). Other important elements of the model include a representative sampling procedure, communication channels with cooperating agencies, an assessment schedule, and instrumentation and data-gathering procedures. Also important are assignment of field assistants to specific sites and solicitation of feedback. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This study attempted to identify which tactics used by administrators had the greatest influence on the introduction of special education curriculum innovations. Surveys and interviews with administrators in 39 sites were used to gather data. The administrators were those identified as advocates of a particular innovation, the Social Learning Curriculum for handicapped students. The survey was adapted from the work of Hull and Kester, based on their theoretical framework of tactic types. This framework, however, did not differentiate among advocates' actions used to introduce a curriculum innovation. Consequently a factor analytic procedure was applied to the data. Three tactic use factors were identified and named following Chin and Benne's conceptualization of strategies of  changing. This conceptualization identifies strategies as empirical-rational (in this case, involving the communication of information), power coercive (here, involving the use of mandates or orders), and normative-re-educative (involving the creation of conditions within which teachers may innovate). The only tactics that were significantly correlated with extent of diffusion of the innovation (defined as teachers in possession of all or part of the curriculum at the time of the study) were the empirical-rational tactics. A copy of the Leadership Actions Survey is appended. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Based on the view that an administrative organization is composed of interacting individuals and that work flows through an interaction process, this paper attempts to develop a methodology that allows for the study of work flow patterns. It also applies this methodology to a particular educational organization in order to understand its peculiar inner workings. The work flow model was developed to estimate the number of steps an administrative system took to handle different types of work. Data were collected from 52 managers in the central office of a large school district by randomly sampling their work activities over a 6-week period. Findings suggest that much of the work carried out in educational organizations is never completed (such as curriculum reform, discipline  policy, or union relations). It was found that the primary carriers and producers of this type of work are upper-level managers. A large proportion of their work was generated by other upper-level managers and probably will also be passed to upper-level managers. This holds for both routine and nonroutine work. These findings are interpreted to mean that upper-level managers spend much time discussing irresolvable issues while lower-level managers are more likely to complete the tasks they undertake.

        "description":"The data and analyses in this report are from the first (1980) wave of information from the National Center for Education Statistics study, &quot;High School and Beyond,&quot; a longitudinal study of U.S. high school seniors and sophomores. Data are available for 30,030 sophomores and 28,240 seniors, a total of 84 percent of the 69,662 students in the sample. Catholic schools, which constitute about two-thirds of the total private sector, and other private schools are separately compared to public schools. For some analyses 11 high-performance private schools and 12 high-performance public schools are included in the comparison. The report covers four major areas of interest in the comparison of public and private schools: student body composition, resources available, the functioning of  the schools, and the outcomes for students. Findings indicate that important factors in bringing about higher scholastic achievement in private and Catholic schools than in public schools are the greater academic demands and more ordered environments. Within the public schools, students who are better disciplined and are in schools with more ordered environments also achieve more highly. Appendices contain statistical references, items from the student and school questionnaires used in the analyses, and a bibliography. (Author/MLF)",

Ss' recall was compared to that of hearing control Ss matched for age. More than half (59.8%) of the total number of sentences recalled by deaf Ss violated rules of English grammar, syntax, or both; while only 9.7% of hearing Ss' errors did so. Deaf Ss also made more recall errors than control Ss. However, deaf Ss could use the semantic relations in English sentences as well as the hearing Ss did to aid in recall, suggesting that the deaf are able to take advantage of semantic information and coding strategies for processing a sentence whether or not these  relations are realized in their syntactic rules.

The authors (McBeath, Blackshear, and Smart) used the Baldwin Identification Matrix (which includes an informal creative thinking test, reading and mathematics tests, grades, and nominations) as a data management system. The 205 students identified were compared with a random sampling of 205 students not selected for the program. Results of the first discriminant analysis indicated that the highest contributor to identification was total nominations (peer, parent, and teacher). The next three contributing variables in descending order were peer nominations, mathematics, and parent nominations. When socioeconomic status was added as a variable, there  was no change in the top discrimination coefficient suggesting that socioeconomic status did not play a very important part in the selection process though it did influence the structure of the discrimination function. When students who stayed in the program were compared with students who did not, total nominations was still the predictor variable contributing most to the function, followed, however, by reading, creative thinking, and mathematics. When socioeconomic status was considered, the variable contributing most to identification of students who stayed in the program from those who didn't was creative thinking, followed by parent nominations, socioeconomic status, and reading.

Key program members are identified for such program areas as curricula development, program evaluation, statewide academic leadership, telecommunications system development, and fiscal/logistic management. The report details achievements of the following four goals: (1) to demonstrate in the peninsula area of Virginia that the intensive use of telecommunications technologies can provide and deliver effective inservice special  education teacher training programs from a central location to remotely located classrooms, at times conducive to inservice teacher attendance, and at per inservice teacher costs within the limits of current budgeting policies and current methodologies; (2) to produce and distribute a comprehensive manual which will describe the curricula, operational needs, technical specifications, and personnel expertise of the project; (3) to make adaptive use of existing special education curricula and audiovisual materials; and (4) to implement an evaluation design and procedures to provide for the collection of quantitative performance data and the assessment of the effectiveness and efficiency of program resources.

The next section outlines the components of the needs assessment phase. The methods of assessing staff needs are discussed, and assessment instruments are examined. Section III describes how identified staff needs are translated into long and short term objectives, and how activities are designed and  implemented to satisfy those objectives. The choices available to the planner when matching program activities with specific training objectives are outlined. Described in the last section is the design of an evaluation plan for a staff development program. Evaluation formats to aid in deciding whether the program has satisfied staff needs and if alternative or additional activities need to be considered are discussed. Appendixes include a staff development checklist, a volunteer observation form, a teacher observation form, a general needs assessment form, a form for the participant's evaluation of inservice, the HCEEP orientation conference questionnaire, a self assessment inventory, and examples of objectives, activities, and evaluation of an outreach inservice training project.

When the needs statements from the survey were ranked, needs related to information about the world of work ranked as seven of the first eight needs statements. Additional needs identified by respondents fell in the categories of training programs for  teachers of deaf students; basic skills instruction; information regarding the world of work; and sufficient support services, resources, and materials. The most highly endorsed need was for role models of deaf individuals currently employed in science related occupations. (The questionnaire is appended.) (CL)",

Topics focused on the history and current status of the consumer movement among LD adults. The concern of national and local LD groups with problems facing LD adults is traced, and current movements within ACLD (Association for Children and Adults with Learning Disabilities) to reflect these concerns are noted. Awareness and self advocacy issues are emphasized. Statewide groups of LD adults, such as Launch, Inc. in Texas, Time Out to Enjoy in Illinois, and the New York Learning Disabled Adult Organization are described. A discussion of challenges facing dyslexics is followed by reports of seven selected local LD adult groups (including Puzzle People in California, Georgia  Association for Adults with LD, and Ohio Council of Learning Disabled Adult Section of ACLD).

The four basic goals of the project are to increase the student's understanding that: (1) Natural laws limit energy availability; (2) Energy consumption affects both man and his environment; (3) Human values and attitudes affect energy usage; and (4) Energy conservation is necessary to maintain our lifestyle.

The science discipline selected for the study was geology. Specifically, the conceptual structures and related taxonomy for classifying rocks were used in the instructional materials designed for the study, which consist of a segment of the field-testing version of the Individualized Science (IS) program. Thirty students from an eighth-grade class in a parochial elementary school were selected for the study. None of these students had previously received instruction on minerals and rocks. All had previously studied IS units, however,  and were thus familiar with the mechanics of the instructional materials. A preinstructional concept structuring task was administered to probe for students' knowledge about rocks and minerals. A pretest on concepts in descriptive geology was then administered. Instruction followed. Posttest and postinstructional concept structuring task administration occurred after instruction. Test results were analyzed in detail. Implications for the administration of probing tasks are discussed, particulary for applicability in instructional techniques and determination of content difficulty for particular students. (CS)",

In the second section, attempts to train students to improve in ability to control variables are analyzed. These studies demonstrate that training improves logical thinking under some conditions.

The lessons in this unit develop the network idea around a simple electrical distribution system that we depend on and also into further consideration of electrical energy itself. The network idea in the later lessons emphasizes the interdependence of the man-made network for producing and distributing electrical energy and the natural ecological network. In the final lesson, the consuming end of the network is examined and some strategies for consuming electrical energy are examined. Students should learn that energy networks such as the electrical circuits are a necessary part of modern life. They are also  expected to learn about sources, conversions, and uses of electrical energy. There are six lessons in this fourth- and fifth-grade unit. Complete teacher and student materials are provided. (BB)",

        "author":["Kellerman, Barbara"],
        "description":"The paper describes developmental theories pertaining to adults and considers the implications of these theories for political scientists. Specifically, the works of four developmental theorists are examined: Erik Erikson's theory of the eight ages of man, Daniel J. Levinson's developmental stages which characterize the life of the early and middle aged male adult, Jane Loevinger's concept of the ego as an organizing agent, and Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development. Common to these theorists is the concept of personality as dynamic rather than static in the adult years. For example, the theorists agree that the belief system changes more often than not during the post-adolescent life course; moral development, at least to the highest stages, takes place as a result of  experiences in young adulthood; ego development makes its longest strides during adulthood and only as the result of an external stimulus; and feelings of self-esteem vary over the life course. Also, the focus of the Committee on Work and Personality in the Middle Years (Social Science Research Council) is outlined. Areas of study include intellectual functioning, sense of self, health and physical functioning, social networks and relationships, and work and retirement. Implications for political scientists are examined in terms of intervention approaches. Deliberate use of politically relevant stimuli may be successful in situations where a new mode of political thought is deemed desirable such as programs geared to adults in prison. The necessity to understand functional age (how well  an individual performs physically, emotionally, and intellectually) as opposed to chronological age is emphasized. (Author/KC)",

Developers believe that the guidelines should be used when evaluating both student and teacher material and for separately evaluating each component of a series. The major portion of the guidelines provides specific criteria for evaluating how male and female roles and ethnic and cultural groups are treated in the curricula. Some criteria for evaluating how labor and religion are treated are also provided. Examples of criteria include that descriptions, depictions, and labels which tend to demean, stereotype, or be patronizing toward females, minority groups,  and/or occupations must not appear; references and illustrations must refer to males and females approximately evenly in both number and importance and must refer to a fair proportion of diverse ethnic groups; sexually neutral language such as people, persons, they, and pioneers should generally be used; no religious belief or practice shall be held up to ridicule; and students must not be indoctrinated in any particular religious belief. The paper concludes with extracts from the Education Code regarding a variety of topics including portrayal of cultural and racial diversity and prohibited instructional materials. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"This paper describes a three-year staff development program in reading and social studies in San Antonio, Texas. The data from a reading test administered to a sample of high school students indicated inferior reading skill development and supported the teachers' contentions that their students could not master social studies material because they could not read them. To attack this problem, a staff development program that would train teachers in functional reading skills and in specific content area skills was devised and implemented. Twelve high school and nine middle grade teachers participated in the program. There was an intensive one week preschool workshop in which prescriptive and diagnostic tools in reading and the social studies were introduced. Bi-monthly inservice  meetings and monthly classroom observations of participant performance were part of the program. Participants also developed social studies materials written at appropriate grade levels. The results of the project indicate: 1) that student performance in functional reading skills can be increased by training teachers in these skills; 2) a developmental model of inservice training provides a successful design in which teachers can work; and 3) intensive content methodology instruction is needed beyond the basic preservice courses now in effect.

Approaches include interdisciplinary, disciplinary, and cross-cultural. The cross-cultural approach emphasizes examining the differences and similarities in the heritage of various ethnic groups in the United States. Groups are divided into five heritage areas: Black American, including Africa, West Indian, and United States; European/Mediterranean American including Europe, the Near East, and Middle East; Hispanic American including Mexico, Central America, and South America; American Indian and Eskimo including North American Indian and  Eskimo tribes; and Asian American and Pacific Islands including China, Japan, Korea, Philippines, India, and Southeast Asia.

Topics are self-identity and awareness of others, family life, working and playing together, food, traditional folk arts and crafts, folk music, stories and storytelling, words and numbers, and celebrations and costumes. Each section presents background information; selected teacher references, some briefly annotated, including books and audiovisual materials; a goal and three sample objectives; suggested learning activities and teaching methods, including an identification of the disciplinary area and relevant materials; and a cross-cultural grid designed to provide quick comparisons of various  categories among the cultures identified.

        "description":"Compatibility of three basic goals of public education in the United States is examined. The goals are: (1) equal educational opportunity, interpreted as giving the same education to all students regardless of factors such as race and parental wealth; (2) general competence, defined as attainment of basic academic skills by the great preponderance of graduates; and (3) excellence, interpreted as achievement of academic potential. Consideration of the compatibility of these goals is undertaken within a framework of subthemes identified by educational researchers as major areas of concern. These include determining costs and benefits of steps schools might take to reduce inequality, diagnosing and dealing with special student capacities, financing remedial and/or gifted student  programs, allocating materials and teachers, and grouping students according to ability. Review of existing educational research literature indicates that although researchers have produced much data on academic achievement, school role, and socioeconomic influences on education, they have generally not related their conclusions to goal compatibility. The conclusion is that researchers will contribute more to an understanding of goal compatibility if they design research linking an intensive case study approach with general analysis of data regarding objectives, achievement, and resource allocation from many types of schools.

Section I defines several key concepts such as culture, racism, ethnic diversity, stereotype, pluralism, ethnic encapsulization, and types of teaching styles and dialects. Suggested activities for teaching cross-cultural understanding are also included. Section II contains summaries of group activities and workshop presentations; a list of teacher perceived needs and problems; a review of multicultural programs and resources in Arlington, Virginia; summaries of discussions on the black student's experience; and culture and communication. Section III topics include Afro-American communication, Black History facts,  Hispanic learners and Anglo teachers, Korean and Vietnamese learners, and literature by the Afro-American. Section IV presents methods for learning more about foreign-born students, analyzing children's books for racism and sexism, using culture consultants, and counseling. Section V offers sample curriculum materials: a study guide to the Smithsonian exhibit, A Nation of Nations; a sample unit illustrating ways to use sports, music, and graphics to teach multicultural concepts; ways to use myths, legends, and folk ballads; and television as a resource for cross-cultural understanding. The final section is an annotated bibliography of evaluation criteria, curriculum development guidelines, bibliographies, teacher evaluation methods, background materials, communication and curriculum  materials, and teaching strategies.

        "description":"The goals of this study were to see if sociology majors are different from other students in what accounts for their interest in classes and secondly to see if the factors producing interest for sociology students vary by the type of class it is. The study was undertaken to help teachers make adjustments which will increase interest, depending on the composition and type of class being taught. Three factors were studied as predictors of course interest: instructor communication, course stimulation, and course applicability. A random sample of sociology majors at a Midwestern University completed a questionnaire for each class they were in. Four types of classes were represented: required courses in and out of sociology and elective courses in and out of sociology. Findings  included the following. Instructor communication was considerably less important for sociology majors than it was for students as a whole. On the other hand, course stimulation was a much stronger predictor of interest for sociology majors than it was for other students. There was little difference across the two samples in the importance of course applicability (present or future). The three factors did vary in importance depending on the class type. Instructor communication was the most consistently important explanation of interest for all types of courses. The college instructor still deserved most of the blame or credit for generating student interest. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"The research paper examines how women's relative preferences for market work and home work are effected by three transitions: first marriage, first birth, and marital dissolution. The hypothesis was that all three events should affect market work preference by changing levels of available resources, such as time and money, and by changing the level of personal fulfillment derived from family life. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Women, a causal model was developed measuring these effects in relation to several background and situational variables. Probit analysis indicated that first marriage decreases market work preferences through age 24 but not beyond that age, perhaps because concomitant changes in resources are less unexpected after than before  that age. Marital dissolution tended to increase preference for market work at ages 19 through 29, probably by exposing women to financial insecurity. A first birth had no immediate impact, but was followed one to two years later by striking upward revisions in marriage and childbearing and increased probability of divorce led to increases in the level of preference for market work. Two recommendations are made: additional research including more detailed information on women's preferences and expectations before and after these events, and that the family-work conflict issues be raised in high school.

Basic environmental limitations which are discussed include population; basic materials such as food, fuels, and water; and environmental tolerance. Ecological hazards which combine with these limitations to result in urgent social problems include laboratory created disease, ozone layer destruction by fluorcarbons, carcinogens in consumer products and food, toxic substances in food, and deforestation. These problems remain largely unsolved in spite of technological interventions of various types including drugs which improve intelligent behavior and enhance awareness, stamina, strength, health, and maximum life-span potential; genetic planning;  man/machine symbiosis; and extra terrestrial communication. Educational tactics and strategies which are currently being employed to prepare students for future society include back to basics, deschooling society, career education, tracking and specialized training, behavior modification, racial integration, bilingual and multicultural education, environmental studies, learning by objectives, and computer assisted instruction. Additional research is suggested to evaluate how these strategies encourage social change in desired directions and prepare young people to live in future societies. (DB)",

The authors contrast CRTs, tests which compare an individual's performance to some specified behavioral criterion of proficiency, and NRTs, tests which compare an individual's score to scores of others. They also state that any test scores must be related to test content; that NRTs also possess content validity; that allegations that standardized test publishers ignore item content in favor of item statistics are inaccurate; and that all achievement tests should be keyed to objectives or to a specified content domain. In deciding which test to use, the authors state that standardized achievement tests sample a broader domain than CRTs and are  more likely to help determine the adequacy of a curriculum than CRTs which are tailor made to specific instructional objectives. CRT interpretation is described as useful for assessing mastery learning; for decision making about instructional change; and for use in broad surveys of educational accomplishment. NRT interpretation is said to be useful for rank ordering of students in specific areas of achievement and for decision making in assessing qualitative factors in addition to mastery. (MH)",

Some of these weaknesses are described as the inadequacy of public education; the incompetence of a portion of the labor force, due to academic weaknesses, which results in lowered national productivity; middle-class students' inflated expectations, which are not borne out by test results; and individuals' reluctance to be judged by others. The speaker asserts that the attacks on testing are now placing more emphasis on the issue of secrecy and less on racial bias. The speaker also discusses the Detroit Edison case, heard before the United  States Supreme Court, involving test security, subject confidentiality, and job-related tests; in this case, the criterion validity method was used to validate the tests. The speaker supports the Court's decision to uphold the confidentiality of the test questions and the answers, and of the names and scores of the test takers, but believes the decision was reached for the wrong reasons and did not predict the precedent for future cases.

Articulation has several stages: identifying student interests, needs and abilities; getting information to students and parents; helping students apply to the school of their choice; informing students and parents of rejections and acceptances; checking and forwarding student records; and designing students' individual programs for the first term of high school. The primary objectives of this study of articulation in the New York City Public Schools are: (1) to identify articulation strengths and problems; and (2) to make recommednations for improving the articulation process. A major finding of this study is that many parents, students and staff are  dissatisfied with articulation practices. Many feel that the process is poorly managed and unnecessarily complex. It is felt that some problems of articulation stem from racial tensions and others from the immense size of the school system and its rigid bureaucratic structure. Data analysis identified specific elements of articulation that need improvement and highlighted those features of the school system that impede the articulation process. (RLV)",

In addition, relevant facilities, laboratories, equipment, documents, reports and libraries were examined.

The second part, focusing on the  academic program, examines such areas as the university organization, budget and finance, curriculum, and specific university departments. The following recommendations are made: (1) the Federal government must make available additional funds for student aid, patient care, and improvements in the school's physical plant; (2) Federal funds must be made available prior to the beginning of the academic year; (3) the school's administration should be decentralized; (4) a faculty practice plan should be adopted as soon as possible; and (5) the research and graduate training programs must be enlarged and enhanced.

Predictions that aspirations would be lowered when men failed to advance in educational level over a one year period and that they would increase on the average when men increased in educational level over a one year period were not borne out. There was little change and it occurred equally for all educational transition groups. When the men were classified according to three levels of ability and three levels of socioeconomic status, the following was observed: (1) low ability and low SES groups increased educational aspirations slightly over  the five year period; (2) average differences between the SES and ability groups in aspiration and attainment levels were all large; (3) educational and occupational aspirations were higher among blacks than among whites of the same SES and ability level; (4) occupational attainments were slightly lower for blacks; and (5) the racial differences in apsirations, and particularly in attainments, were not large compared to the differences found by SES and ability.

A systematic comparison was made of the relative treatments accorded black housing seekers and white housing seekers. Results indicate that white applicants for housing were favored more frequently on most indices of discrimination than their black counterparts. These indices of discrimination included information offered on housing availability, courteous treatment by realtors, the terms and conditions presented to  applicants, and the housing information requested or volunteered by realtors. Also presented are comparisons of housing availability for the different cities surveyed, implications of the findings for policy, and a report on related analyses now in progress.

        "description":"A survey research study was conducted to determine the range and attitudes of youth in New York State vocational and 4-H organizations concerning traditional and changing sex roles. The survey instrument consisted of two parts: a short multifactor true/false quiz to sample knowledge of changes in male and female participation in employment, family, and marriage situations (test-retest reliability .55) and an attitude measure on the same variables plus educational and social activities (Spearman-Brown .62 reliability). Random sampling techniques, including stratification for region and vocational group, were used for every organization except 4-H. A total of 1218 scorable surveys were returned: 862 from females, 356 from males. Although knowledge among the respondents appeared to  increase with age, survey results indicated that youths are not as knowledgeable as adults about changes in the labor force and the family and that they tend to hold traditional sex role expectations. Attempts to promote more liberal sex-role attitudes have apparently been more successful with females, since males were significantly less knowledgeable and more traditional in attitudes about changing roles. Further research should concentrate on reasons for the differences in response among the sexes and appropriate intervention strategies. (Author/MEK)",

Jobs for Youth's association with the public and private sectors of educational institutions and industry, community involvement, and qualified staff benefited the reading academy program. The program provided such retention incentives as stipends and job placement for participants recruited primarily through referrals. The Reading Academy project was  incorporated into an educational services component of Jobs for Youth. Other components were employer services, counseling, and operations. Designed to equip youth with the functional competencies needed to make the transition to work, educational services used a competency-based curriculum to ensure a match between &quot;academic&quot; skills (education) and actual job demands (work). In a laboratory setting both commercial and &quot;homemade&quot; materials were used. Evaluation processes involved student assessment, formative program assessment, and summative evaluation. (YLB)",

        "description":"Using a case study approach, an eighteen-month review assessed the implementation of the Youth Employment and Demonstration Projects Act (YEDPA) in thirty-seven prime sponsorships in twelve states. Most states showed progress in establishing a role for local educational agencies in the prime sponsor employment and training service matrix. But too little time or incentive has limited union and private employer involvement. To meet developmental needs of youth, sponsors have paid more attention to systematic sequencing of services, emphasized program quality, and tied manpower to education through collaboration with local schools. Despite flexible program targeting, cost and reporting disincentives have deterred special needs group identification. A crisis climate has hindered  knowledge development by not permitting time for activities without immediately usable pay-offs, while the maintenance-of-effort mandate has proven hard to enforce. &quot;Sticks&quot; (statutes and regulations) and &quot;carrots&quot; (financial incentives) have failed to assure that new programs serve intended federal objectives. Furthermore, uncertainty about funding levels, regulations, and the law itself lessen federal block grant program effectiveness. (Recommendations are made for improving YEDPA program operations and considerations when enacting and implementing new legislation. The ten case study areas are summarized.) (YLB)",

Within each interest area are work groups (occupational clusters) suitable for exploration by those who have a particular interest. Each work group section contains descriptive information and listings of jobs by \"Dictionary of Occupational Titles\" (DOT) name and code. Information on each work group is presented under the following question headings: What kind of work would you do? What skills and abilities do you  need? How do you know if you would like or could learn to do this kind of work? How can you prepare for and enter it? What else should you consider about these jobs? Appended is an alphabetical listing of all DOT titles and codes listed in the guide. Other appendixes explain how the twelve interest areas were developed, describe the U.S. Employment Service (USES) Interest Inventory (under development) and its General Aptitude Test Battery (GATB), list occupations for which Specific Aptitude Tests (SATBs) have been developed, and suggest uses of the guide for cataloging and filing occupational information materials.

Results from three initial working groups addressing equipment, market penetration, and skills analysis were combined by a fourth manpower assessment group to (1) forecast solar-trained manpower needs and (2) determine the training required to produce manpower capable of performing the identified tasks. Based on data from available market studies, the demand for trained workers to design, install, and maintain solar systems will be substantial and will develop concurrently with the demand for solar equipment.  According to solar market projections, 2.4 million solar units will be installed by 1985. By that time there must be 25,000 skilled workers in the solar field, one-fifth trained at the technician level. Solar technician training should be equivalent in length and extent to that for heating, ventilating, and air conditioning technicians--approximately a two-year program. Solar mechanics training can continue to be provided by solar industry. To meet the demand, approximately eight schools, each graduating fifty solar technicians a year, are needed.

Ten interpersonal factors and five organizational factors were identified and examined. Although no one factor could be cited as solely responsible, the literature clearly indicated that a number of factors are inextricably bound together in the underrepresentation of women. Some studies indicated how women perceive themselves and their career goals; others related to the perception of others with whom they interact, including family, friends, and employers.  Organizational factors such as admission and hiring practices and communications patterns were identified as barriers. Although legislative mandates now prohibit policies and procedures which discriminate against women, an organization must look beyond the law and actively implement strategies to erase the more subtle, traditional patterns of practice which have been ingrained into organizations. A two-pronged redirection for research and development efforts is recommended: (1) an investigation of strategies and intervention processes focused on both external and internal change to affect administrative decision makers and (2) examination of the benefits accruing to vocational education as women are appointed to decision-making positions.

Planning for change should be based on the implications of the broadest societal issues as they evolve over the coming years. Accordingly, vocational programs need to be carefully reviewed to make certain students are being prepared to look beyond the entry level and to understand how skills and experiences on one level may later apply to another level or occupation. The profession needs to organize programs, institutions, agencies, and individuals to respond to the changes as they occur. If we accept projections of the age, sex, and racial composition of the work force, it probably means a transition to a new organization for the delivery of vocational education. Perhaps  the profession needs one or more of its members to become vocational futurists--constantly challenging the planning of vocational education in the context of major social, economic, and political change. More emphasis should be placed on research and development toward retooling vocational education. The Department of Labor youth employment initiative may be the first of these challenges.

Group mean and individual true gain (change) analyses were used to document whether shifts in personality functioning took place and to identify college activities related to various shifts. Variables examined included reason for  attending college, aspirations, co-curricular activities, grades, employment during school, relationship to parents, and marital status. Changes in personality functioning for traditional-age students seemed attenuated compared with the results of studies conducted during earlier decades. College attendance was associated with changes in personality functioning for both older and younger students, although changes did not occur in all students nor was the directionality of change consistent. Given the increasing heterogeneity of collge student populations, the use of group mean scores to assess personality functioning during the first year of college may no longer be defensible. (PV)",

        "description":"A study examined the validity of using the Minnesota Job Description Questionnaire to measure occupational reinforcer patterns (ORPs). Although ORP profiles (twenty-one adjusted scales) were developed a decade ago to operationalize a key variable in the Theory of Work Adjustment (Lofquist and Davis, 1969), little validity evidence exists. An examination of the process by which adjusted ORP scores are created from the ipsative unadjusted scores suggested several threats to validity. In addition, correlations of the ORP scales with Census Bureau and Department of Labor Data on pay, education, occupational self-direction, and seventeen worker trait requirements show that (1) among the seven adjusted ORP scales for which there was good validation criteria, five were of questionable  validity, (2) among the remaining fourteen adjusted reinforcers, several do not correlate in intelligible ways with the job characteristics data, and (3) the adjusted scores are no more valid than are the unadjusted scores. Discriminant analyses showed that the two sets of scales discriminate equally well among occupations, but different reinforcers are most important for separating the groups. The conclusion from the discriminant analyses is that whereas the unadjusted scales provide limited but useful information, the adjusted scores provide no new information and may be less interpretable than the unadjusted scores. Some specific recommended uses of the ORP scores should be examined. (Possible explanations for the failure of the scaling method to produce valid absolute ORP scores are  discussed.) (Author/PV)",

        "author":["Greenwood, Katy Lee Brown"],
        "description":"To knowledgeably debate with revisionist historians regarding the early history of vocational education and the social intentions of early leaders, vocational educators should focus attention on three general questions regarding (l) the validity of historical research, (2) motives of historical researchers, and (3) the kind of research responsibility necessary for any field of endeavor. The first question is concerned with the appropriate methodology for interpreting history. Controversy centers on the ways in which the validity of historical interpretation can be judged and on the existence of standards of precision and credibility. Much revisionist criticism may be due to misinterpretation. The second question concerns varying motives of historical researchers which can lead to  conflicting interpretations. Centered at liberal centers of social activism, revisionists see historical interpretation as a method of bringing social change. Vocational education must respond to this political, not historical, debate with close examination of methodology and demands for standards of precision and credibility and not with selective reporting. The third question concerns why vocational education is remiss in interpreting its history and philosophy. To counteract damage done by political interpretations by historians and historiographers, vocational education must assume responsibility for interpreting its own history and philosophies and accelerate its emphasis on historiography.

The central objectives of the research were (1) to describe the planning systems that have emerged, (2) to relate the features of planning systems to contextual factors, and (3) to explore the links between these planning systems and program performance. Intensive field work was done in twelve prime sponsorships which were selected because they were reputed to take planning seriously. Results were compared on some questions with national averages and with observations in thirty other prime sponsorships in which intensive field work was  done for previous studies. Three major models of planning were observed in the field work studies, as well as a group of exemplary approaches to critical elements of planning and management. The most general finding was that careful planning by prime sponsorship staff does have the potential for helping improve program performance. However, planning was found to be only one of a number of aspects of prime sponsorship management that needs to be handled well in order to achieve programmatic goals. Fortunately, these elements of management are highly manipulable at the local level, and non-manipulative elements of local context such as economic conditions do not create severe restraints on what can be achieved. (Observations and specific recommendations for improving prime sponsor  activities are included for review and implementation.) (BM)",

Development of a quality of work life project was described as a multi-phase process. Someone in the union, management, or outside organization seeks to initiate interest in his idea in the startup phase. The get-going phase involves creation of the project  structure--committees with joint labor and management representation. Implementation and expansion in the \"going\" phase depend on effective resolution of issues concerning activities and goals. From the start ground rules (contracts and letters of agreement) should be defined. Project participation and involvement should be continually expanded and maintained when changes appear imperceptible.

        "description":"An evaluation study of some work preparation (or pre-vocational education) programs in New South Wales and Queensland (Australia) was conducted to accomplish the following objectives: (1) to establish a general methodological framework for the continuing evaluation of Technical and Future Education (TAFE) pre-vocational programs; (2) to obtain a worthwhile assessment of the effectiveness of a selected number of work preparation programs currently offered; and (3) to identify major problems and factors which could guide the future development of work preparation programs. In developing a strategy for the evaluation of TAFE pre-vocational education programs, a start was made by examining the main aspects of its rationale and the key features of four programs in this field. The  results of this examination enabled general approaches to educational evaluation to be incorporated in an evaluation framework for pre-vocational education. Subsequently, it was possible to identify data which needed to be collected about each element of the framework and to suggest instruments which might be used for this purpose. Finally, suggestions were made of means by which data gathered about each element in the framework could be used in further analyses. (This report is primarily concerned with the first objective and contains a description of some new developments in pre-vocational education, a discussion of the rationale for programs in this area, and an outline of an evaluation approach.)

A sample of 200 enrollees was selected to be interviewed by telephone. The survey instrument was a two-part questionnaire developed by the project and designed (1) to gather personal data about the student, and (2) to discover what the student liked or disliked about the course in which he enrolled and his relationship to, and degree of satisfaction with, University Extension. Data analyzed by the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences  were also subjected to other tests: the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, crosstabulation, and factor analysis. Results were then compared with a contemporary macro study conducted in California to determine which segment of the need for postsecondary education that University Extension was successfully meeting. A secondary purpose of correlating degree of student satisfaction with service provided by Extension with demographic characteristics was frustrated by skewed results from satisfaction measures.

Well-designed and implemented interdisciplinary programs would assist allied health administrators in answering the needs of its diverse publics. Historically, an interdisciplinary approach in the health sciences has been demanded by these forces. Unfortunately, with its multiple definitions, interdisciplinary education confuses and poses problems for administrators attempting to implement the approach. An administrator of the allied health unit must address issues related to the tools of production (organization of the program, faculty, and  curriculum), the raw material (students), and the final product (the reality of the outcome of interdisciplinary efforts). Perhaps the biggest challenge for the administrator is not only to facilitate development of innovative instructional forms, but also to deal with complex organizational change. Specific administrative decision making occurs at two levels: (1) those decisions which begin the change process including organizational goal setting, problem diagnosis, and postures necessary for interdisciplinary development and (2) those which relate to the issues of implementation and maintenance of interdisciplinary activity (program operation).

Empirical data collected in several earlier projects was subjected to two forms of validation on a national basis. On a job analysis survey workers in the field indicated the frequency with which they performed tasks in the first validation. Hierarchical-grouping-statistical procedures were used to analyze these data and to group related tasks into clusters from which forty competency statement constructs were derived. A second validation of the competency statements involved obtaining scaled data which identified the relative frequence, importance to client, and potential risk to client (if poorly done) for each competency.  Respondents (supervisors, educators, and workers) also identifed the level of worker currently performing each competency. Analysis of survey returns suggested that (1) the statements covered mental health/human service work completely and (2) the basis for partitioning the work into levels is weak.

Produced through use of the Delphi technique, two lists of variables (organizational resources and organizational characteristics) formed the content of a questionnaire developed for administration to 178 members of twenty-seven service clubs (Exchange, Kiwanis, Lions, Rotary) in Delaware, New Jersey, and eastern Pennsylvania. A company's overall willingness to share resources was compared to eleven operating characteristics: current school assistance, formal recruitment program, formal staff training program, management that  encourages employee community service, hiring of skilled non-professionals, support of employee education, engagement in public service, public relations officer, student hiring, job openings, and apprenticeship program. Willingness to share each of sixteen resources was also compared to six other organizational characteristics. Responses were also analyzed for two open-ended questions: other resources business might be willing to share and other ways in which businesses would like to be involved in planning and implementing career education programs. The major conclusion was that the employer community is an underused resource available to schools. (YLB)",

Applicants to the YCC program were assigned to treatment and control groups randomly and an intervention by investigators increased participants' opportunities to participate in decision making in one of the four crews, as confirmed by regular observations. Pre- and  post-program administration of the Ego Development Scale, and the Psychosocial Maturity Inventory, and of an interview designed to assess the structure of thinking about work-related issues will allow assessment of whether adolescents in the YCC developed more than those not selected for the program and whether participants in the participatory-democratic work crew developed more than those in the other crews. If the evidence is suggestive investigators hope to conduct a study to confirm or disprove the hypotheses.

To identify strategies employed for increasing the participation of private employers in CETA programs, information was obtained at each site about the local program, labor market, population and enrollee characteristics, placements, relationships with service deliverers and business organizations, and employers' perceptions of the CETA program. Findings which were evident in most, although often not all, of the prime sponsors surveyed included these: (1) the local unemployment rate was only one among several factors influencing employers' participation, (2) a large majority of the on-the-job training and classroom  training placements took place in smaller establishments, (3) state and local government agencies together with community organizations accounted for over half the membership of the planning councils, and (4) there was evidence of enrollee selectivity in the program involving the maximum employer participation. Following the introductory overview and summary, the bulk of the document focuses on descriptions of the individual prime sponsors. Descriptions are provided of their individual characteristics, program priorities, linkages with employers, and placement and training records. The final chapter discusses implications for policy.

Of those who return to smoking after abstaining, a subgroup includes those who do so incrementally, eventually reaching their former level. An approach aimed at this subgroup, originally used in a group setting, involves intensifying the desire to smoke (flooding) and then using hypnosis to desensitize this impulse. The underlying assumptions of the approach are that smoking is a habit requiring an act of will to change, and hypnosis can augment will power. In an individualized context, a group of 23 subjects were used to test this, specifically aiming at a subgroup of 7 who resumed smoking after briefly abstaining. A general hypnotic technique was used for the original subjects which  included a follow-up home regimen of self-hypnosis. Seven individuals reported complete abstinence during follow-up. Seventeen reported a brief abstention only, and sought repeated treatment. The specific flooding and hypnotic and desensitization technique was used, again including a home regimen of self-hypnosis following the directed session. Of these seven, four individuals reported complete abstinence during the follow-up period. (Author/BMW)",

Subjects solicited from the community (N=48) were assigned to an assertion training plus generalization instructions (AT Plus), an assertion training only (AT Only), or an attention-placebo control condition. Both behavioral assessments, suing a procedure specifically developed to assess generalization, and self-report measures of assertion were included. While self-report data failed to suggest differential treatment effects, videotape data clearly showed the behavioral superiority of experimental subjects in response to training stimuli. The data further suggested that training had generalized across responses classes for experimental subjects at both  post-treatment and follow-up. Surprisingly, those in the AT Only group showed more transfer than did those in the AT Plus condition. It was concluded that generalization may occur following assertion training, and that the use of programmed generalization procedures may be counterproductive. (Author)",

Hypnocounseling is a modality of mental health counseling, a body of knowledge which can be applied to the framework of any personality theory by a trained mental health counselor of any established approach or theoretical background. Some of its features are a de-emphasis on hypnotizability as a trait, an emphasis on voluntary activation of skills in a creative cognitive/experiential process, and the change of control focus from hypnotist to client. Clinical uses of hypnocounseling include exploration, evaluation, symptom alleviation, ego enhancement, and mental rehearsal. (Author/HLM)",

Phases I and II of the study involved 51 subjects who participated in a five-day smoking cessation project consisting of lectures, demonstrations, practice exercises, negative smoking, and the teaching of self-control procedures. At the program's termination Phase III commenced and all subjects were randomly assigned to one of three maintenance conditions: (1) a four-week support group which offered an opportunity to discuss feelings and thoughts; (2) a four-week telephone contact system which enabled group members to call one another; and (3) a no contact control group. Extensive follow-up data were collected at the end of treatment and at two months, while only  abstinence data were gathered at four months and at six months post-treatment. In addition, recidivists were required to complete a \"Return to Smoking Questionnaire.\" Results indicated that the treatment program was extremely effective: 100% of the subjects were abstinent at the end of treatment and 76.5% were abstinent six months post-treatment. Recidivists reported a smoking rate that was 52% of baseline at the six month time period. There were no significant differences among the three maintenance conditions. (Author)",

Few theories which integrate isolated research findings into a causal sequence have emerged, however. One such model outlines the process through which teacher expectations may sustain student performance by proposing that teachers more frequently use negative affectively valenced feedback to low expectation students as a mechanism for interaction control, while high expectation students more frequently receive feedback based on their effort expenditure. These different evaluation contingencies lead to a lesser belief on the part of lows than highs that  effort will influence academic outcomes. As with learned helplessness effects, differences in effort-outcome covariation perceptions may lead to less persistence and more failure on the part of lows than highs, thus sustaining poor performance. Support for several aspects of the model comes from varying sources, including this first attempt to test the entire hypothesized sequence within the same system of naturally-occurring teacher-student relations.

Research on retirement has been directed primarily toward the impact of retirement on the retiree, rather than on the marital dyad. Qualitative and quantitative changes that women experience were investigated, with regards to their role as wife in response to their husband's retirement. Three issues of the woman's role as housewife were examined: personal, relational and life cycle. Four hundred male retired teachers and their wives were surveyed by questionnaire, with a subsequent interview sample (N=253), drawn from returned questionnaires. Findings indicate that the major shift for women was toward increased accommodation to their husbands' needs, and the negative changes experienced by women were  offset by increased opportunities for nurturing of spouse.

Conditioned anxiety and pain associated with recurrent diagnostic and treatment procedures have been identified as major sources of distress in children with malignant disease. To evaluate the efficacy of various psychological strategies for distress reduction, valid situation-specific measurement tools are required. A 25-item behavioral observation scale of distress during a selected procedure, bone marrow aspiration, was developed. Observations of 115 children with leukemia, ranging in age from 8 months to 17 years, 9 months, were collected. Trained observers were utilized, achieving an inter-rater reliability above .90. Results indicated clear age  differences, with younger children exhibiting more distress behaviors and more gross motor behaviors than older children. Females exhibited more behaviors than males across age groups, also displaying more emotional interactivity than males. Behavioral observation and independent nurse ratings correlated .66. A replication and extention of the first study included a self-report measure of general affective state during the procedure. With a sample of 151 children, the self-report measure correlated significantly with objective behaviors and nurse ratings, but only for children above age six. Self-report scores, as with behavioral indicators, generally decreased with increasing age. (Author)",

        "description":"This staff development module is part of one of three groups of career guidance modules developed, field-tested, and revised by a six-state consortium coordinated by the American Institutes for Research. This module is designed for guidance personnel who work in counseling and guidance with students in school settings, grades K-12, and especially grades 7-12. The goal of this module is to help participants: (1) select and implement collaborative career guidance projects; (2) determine requisite personnel and material resources; and (3) effectively disseminate the resulting information. The module format consists of an overview, goals, objectives, outline, time schedule, glossary, readings, skill development activities, and bibliography. A Coordinator's Guide is also included with  detailed instructions for presenting the module in a workshop setting as well as the facilitator's roles and functions, and the criteria used in assessing the participants' achievement of module objectives.

Third, sixth, and ninth grade Anglo-American, Black, and Hispanic students completed sentence fragments ending in &quot;and,&quot;&quot;but,&quot;&quot;because,&quot; and &quot;even though.&quot; These conjunctions can be paired &quot;and-but&quot; and &quot;because-even though,&quot; thereby making the second member of each pair the negative of the first. The positive member of each pair proved to be easier to master than the negative one, with the overall order of difficulty (from easiest to hardest) being because-and-but-even though. This order of difficulty was constant across grades and ethnic groups. All ethnic groups showed improvement in the use of conjunctions between third and ninth grades; but  Anglo-American students achieved effective mastery of each conjunction earliest, while Hispanic students achieved mastery latest.

The analysis included a summary of the language arts involved, the duration of specific instructional segments and their percentage of the total class time, and apparent patterns in the use of print. Although print was present for 72% of all class time, students were reading in the conventional sense only 10% of the time. For the remaining time that print was available, use of print appeared to cluster into five main categories: cuing responses, reinforcing oral presentations, structuring the teacher's presentation, correcting assignments, and copying. Because students infrequently read in class either to learn or to  review information, there was little opportunity to observe teachers introducing or following up on reading assignments. There also was little evidence that students were developing mature reading and study skills in these classes. (RL)",

        "description":"Results of a 1977 assessment of the reading abilities of approximately 1,250 adults (26 to 35 years old) are reported in this paper and are compared with results of a similar assessment made in 1971. After discussing a typical comprehension exercise used in the assessment, the paper presents the materials and multiple choice questions used in assessing respondents' comprehension of four types of practical materials: a classified advertisement, an advertisement from a national magazine, a parking ticket, and a life insurance form. It then presents four exercises involving materials of a more difficult nature: two expository passages, a poem, and a graph. For each of the eight exercises, the paper indicates the percentage of adults responding to each answer and notes changes in  those percentages from 1971. Among the major conclusions reported are that there was apparently little change in overall reading ability between 1971 and 1977, that a great many adults may still have difficulty reading passages that call for higher-level comprehension skills (for instance, key percentages of success on six questions with medium- to high-difficulty passages ranged from only 18% to 60%), and that amount of time spent watching television and amount of time spent reading appear to relate to reading performance.

        "description":"Nonformal educational programs, which are frequently characterized by their transmission of knowledge outside the limitations and role expectations of the traditional classroom, exist today as they have throughout the past. Among the common characteristics of the diverse nonformal educational programs throughout the world is their responsiveness to the immediate needs of a specific population or situation. One of the most successful literacy programs to date is the nonformal program developed in Brazil by Paulo Freire. Freire's program begins with the development of a core vocabulary based on a study of the life issues faced by the illiterate population to be taught, followed by the development and use of word cards and of pictures to stimulate discussion. In New Zealand, Sylvia  Ashton-Warner rejected standard basal readers for her Maori students and developed a nonformal approach in which she solicited vocabulary words from each child and used the words as the basis for beginning reading, creative writing, spelling instruction, and reading and writing practice. Ashton-Warner also created reading books for Maori children. Among the aspects of Freire and Ashton-Warner's work that are indicative of many nonformal educational programs are a rejection of traditional materials, redefinition of the teacher role, flexibility, and response to students' emotional needs. The documented successes of nonformal approaches to reading instruction suggest the desirability of incorporating such nonformal approaches as the language experience approach in beginning reading  programs.

Forty-four study strategies were identified based on answers to a questionnaire concerning how they studied that was given to one hundred university freshmen enrolled in an elective reading and study skills class. Next, a comparable sample of 133 freshmen students were given both an economics chapter to read and the 44 strategies, followed by a seven point Likert-type scale to indicate the frequency with which they perceived themselves using each strategy. The 133 freshmen were divided into good, average, and poor readers according to their scores on the Nelson-Denny Reading Test. The good and poor readers' responses to the 44 questions were  analyzed. Analysis revealed few significant differences between responses of good and poor readers. Two of the reported differences between good and poor readers were that good readers' strategies reflected a sense of a serious, systematic approach to text reading and that good readers reported reading for an overview more often than did poor readers.

        "description":"A study of 180 seventh grade students was conducted to discover the relative value of teaching vocabulary by teaching whole words contrasted with teaching prefixes. Two experimental groups and a control group were formed of equal numbers of high, middle, and low ability students based on their scores on the Nelson Reading Test. One experimental group was taught prefixes, whole words, and their meanings. The other experimental group was taught only whole words and their meanings. The control group did free reading during the instruction time of the experimental groups. Each group was given a pretest, a posttest, and a delayed posttest. Both experimental groups did better on the posttest and the delayed posttest than did the control group. The prefix treatment, which took no longer  to administer than the whole word treatment, resulted in students learning more prefixes and in their being able to use their knowledge of the prefixes to unlock the meaning of novel words.

        "description":"The effectiveness of mapping for middle school students was tested, using 11 eighth graders who were taught to map short expository prose passages during approximately 12 hours of instruction. Mapping is an innovative reading comprehension strategy in which students identify the important relationships defining the text structure and re-represent the interconnected ideas symbolically, thereby producing a diagrammatic representation of text meaning. In a static group comparison, the subjects who mapped two passages recalled a greater proportion of idea units than did the control subjects, who used their own preferred reading strategy. The differences in recall were statistically significant for the 24-hour delayed recall following one passage, and approached significance for the  immediate recall following the second passage. For both passages, the probability of recalling mapped idea units was significantly greater than the probability of recalling unmapped idea units. These results suggest that the mapping strategy may help students process text in a way that facilitates recall. (Author/RL)",

Ground is the common property that links the two terms of a metaphor (topic and vehicle). The development of subjects' preferences for single metaphorical grounds was marked by a shift from static perceptual grounds (shape and color) to more dynamic perceptual grounds (sound and movement). Nonperceptual, conceptual grounds occurred, but were late in their development. An increased concurrence was evident between the ability to explicate particular grounds and the preferences for these grounds. Although preference for  literal completions declined with age, an unexpected and differently motivated increase in literal selections in grades eight and ten occurred. (Author/RL)",

        "description":"The fact that technical writing is a form of discourse and not just a craft to be learned for a specific purpose means that it has at least three implications for the structure of writing programs. First, it is a method of writing development that is \"you-centered\" rather than \"I-centered.\" Second, it is a heuristic for perceiving and organizing experience in a technological society. Third, it is a pragmatic alternative to the traditional and sometimes stale approaches to composition. Knowing and building on these implications, teachers of technical writing should seek to synthesize concepts of traditional freshman composition with concepts of traditional technical communication to revitalize their writing courses and to provide students with practical, lifelong learning skills.  Communication is the basis of society's existence; and writing teachers must aid the development of their students' abilities to become parts of the system. Teachers can do this only by showing students the devices with which the system operates--the rhetoric that underlies technical writing. (RL)",

The children were asked to explain concrete, interactive, and abstract concepts to an imaginary creature (a puppet). For half the items, an initial period of spontaneous discussion was followed by questions that directed the children to make comparisons. Responses were examined for the number of analogies used, the degree of tension captured in the comparison, and the children's tendencies to explicate their comparisons. The results documented an increase with age in the number of analogies produced, the amount of tension present in the comparison, and the children's tendencies to explain  their associations. A period of literalness and conventionality during the middle years of grade school was suggested by a drop in the creativity of spontaneous analogies by fourth grade students. These children showed more benefits from direct questioning than the older and younger subjects, who performed better in \"freer\" situations. Analysis of item types showed that concepts which presented a moderate but not insuperable challenge were most likely to encourage the production of analogies. (Author/RL)",

Television news was perceived as highly credible across all the measures, although significant differences existed across some of the credibility items.

In the action unit, students examine the effects of sex-role stereotyping in their own lives, noting discrepancies between how things are and how things  might be. The students also are asked to develop plans of action for making changes in their own behaviors. Although the action unit that is offered focuses on making changes in behaviors that occur in relationships with the opposite sex, the unit also may focus on developing communication skills that may not have developed in either men or women becuase of sex-role stereotyping--skills such as assertiveness, the expression of emotions, and self-disclosure.

Teachers who see their role as preparing children to fill social roles will be aware of the speech styles that children use and will accept varying speech styles as appropriate to varying settings. In operating classrooms so that children can develop and use a repertoire of speech styles, teachers should realize that different classroom situations promote different speech styles ranging from intimate to casual to consultative and finally to formal. They should be aware that speech style is also influenced by group size, which may range from dyadic situations to large groups; by the relationship between children,  which ranges from intimate to formal; by the distance between speaker and listener; and by the subject matter being taught. By adapting instructional settings and activities in accordance with the various factors affecting speech styles, teachers can create realistic situations that promote appropriate speech. (GT)",

It uses recent literature reviews and longitudinal studies from the ERIC database that focus on the relevant variables. Detailed discussions are offered of classroom variables--class size, grade level and curriculum area, social skills, and team teaching; teacher variables--sex of the teacher, conceptual structures, and control strategy feedback; and school variables--administrative behavior, school climate, organizational structure, open-space schools, structured classes, teacher stability, and grade retention. One of the findings shown is that emphasizing the learning of social skills in the classroom may facilitate  academic achievement. Also, the style of teaching used by a teacher in the classroom could have a significant impact on student learning as would providing teachers with appropriate feedback regarding their teaching styles. Implications for policy and for further research are discussed in detail. (Author/LD)",

Discussed are the different measures of equity for children and taxpayers, the values inherent in those measures, and their statistical properties. Also discussed are the status of equalization among the 50 states and the impacts of special adjustments. An extensive appendix explains formulas used and offers a state-by-state equity analysis. The booklet is useful for presenting a framework for sorting out the many policy goals for state school finance structures, for developing a set of terms that can lead to a common financial language, and for  measuring the degree of equity in the 50 state school finance and tax structures.

Of the districts responding to this national survey, 59 percent said they had encountered at least one of six specified problems stemming from some children's eligibility for more than one program.

The literature on the following questions is examined: Can learning disabilities be predicted and will early identification help alleviate the problem? Can training programs significantly remediate reading disabilities? What effects do vision and visual perception have on learning disabilities? Is oral language an indication of learning disability? Are learning disabilities inherited and does maturation have an effect on the disabled child? Do learning disabled children exhibit poor attitudes and can these attitudes be helped through remediation? Is memory effected by learning disabilities and is speed in relation to time a significant factor? It is  concluded that the majority of studies indicate that learning disabilities can be remediated through various programs and training techniques after they have been predicted and diagnosed.

Good readers in fourth, fifth, and sixth grade realized the following seven LFEs most frequently: parental desire for higher education for the adult; parental praise for writing, drawing, or reading; parental feelings that the quality of kindergarten and first grade reading instruction is good; working with pencil and paper at home; talking with a parent about daily activities; parental willingness to answer questions; and parental reading of books and stories to the child. Another study showed that parents, even though undereducated, can provide a significant start for their children  during the first year of formal schooling. Results of other studies show that one to one tutorial approaches are important and viable ways of providing learning skill improvement to LD school age children. (CL)",

The single access assumption, the passive memory assumption, and the heterogeneous memory assumption are rejected in favor of the theory which assumes several active memories, each able to store expression based on only one homogenous set of abstract primitives. One lexicon provides a systematic phonemic description of each morpheme and another supplies a syntactic description of each item. The third contains the semantic description of every item in the phonemic lexicon and description of any syntactic elements that do not appear in the phonemic lexicon. Each lexicon stores only one kind and all of that kind of information. In comprehension, each lexicon compares the input to its contents. If it finds a  mismatch, it withdraws as a possible analyzer of input and passes the item on to the next lexicon. This serial odering prevents errors in comprehension. Errors in production, such as malapropisms (which form the empirical motivation for the hypothesis) occur because output is planned simultaneously rather than serially. Through this theory of discrete components of the human language performance system, various disorders defined as the disruption of some subset of components may be predicted. (PMJ)",

A determination of the degree to which one lanquage or dialect differs from another requires the examination of language universals. To study what languages have in common, attention has to be given to the physical, psychological, and social characteristics common to human beings and the characteristics common to all languages. Universal human characteristics furnish the parameters and the language universals indicate the kinds of measures that are needed. Universal distinctions such as mind and body, or code and speech, lead to a consideration of the measurement of distance among languages from a number of points of view: (1) language and discourse; (2) static and dynamic  distance; (3) distance as difference and as conversion; (4) taxonomic and integral distance; (5) semantic and formal distance; (6) direct and indirect distance; and (7) diversity, intensity, and productivity. The utility of each scale and approach to the problem depends on the end in view. The research suggests that a number of problems in pedagogy as well as in linguistics and psychology might be illuminated by the establishment of standard scales of measurement. (AMH)",

Rate of information delivery can be controlled by limiting the actual rate of words per unit of time, or by maintaining content difficulty within certain boundaries. Time-altered recordings have been used with success at both the secondary and university levels. Rate of delivery has also been demonstrated to be a useful tool for testing language proficiency. The manipulation of rate-controlled speech is a promising research technique as well. For example, such manipulation could facilitate studies of the kinds of information lost by student listeners and the probable  causes of such loss. (JB)",

Program implementation involves material selection and the establishment of schedules and administrative procedures. Finally, program assessment by means of formative and summative evaluations should determine the fate of the program after prescribing recommendations to improve program effectiveness.

        "description":"Ethical concerns related to faculty consulting and other professional activities for supplemental pay are discussed. Some groups, like students and taxpayers, may find it difficult to view outside professional activities of faculty members in the context of public service and professional development. Universities employing academic professionals are beginning to recognize problems with a role definition for faculty that includes provision of tenured job security yet little stipulation of what a full-time appointment really entails. Many problems relating to consulting and other outside activities stem from the fact that it is difficult, if not impossible, for faculty to earn supplemental income without using university resources in some way. These include: faculty time,  university supplies and materials, campus facilities, and the use of the university's name. Although outside professional activities are not inherently detrimental to higher education, conflicts are common in terms of how faculty incorporate outside commitments within their overall professional activities. Two hypothetical cases in which ethical problems are involved are presented. The cases raise two major issues important to a discussion of ethics in outside professional activities: intellectual bias and conflicts of interest with respect to time usage. The Ethical and Economic Issues Project at the University of Southern California is cited. (SW)",

        "description":"Current evidence on the prospective decline of the labor market for Ph.D.'s is examined. Focus is on the effects of the decline in academic hiring in the quality and quantity of scholarship and research. After an introduction to the problem, the second chapter summarizes the evidence on the impending decline, maintaining that (1) research is a public good, (2) falling university enrollments will lead to fewer jobs in academe which will harm research and scholarship (and higher education generally), (3) universities cannot respond effectively, and, therefore, (4) governmental intervention is warranted. Chapter Three considers the nature of university research as a public good. The effects of reduced academic hiring, including numbers, quality, decline in research, and loss of  young scholars, are surveyed in the fourth chapter. Chapter Five evaluates the arguments concerning the inability of universities to adjust optimally to the decline. The final chapter reviews alternative interventions, such as improving admissions procedures, supporting graduate students, creating more jobs in academe, and funding more research. (Author/PHR)",

Comparisons are made with entering freshmen at all universities participating in the annual freshman norms surveys sponsored by the American Council on Education and the Cooperative Institutional Research Program of the University of California at Los Angeles (CIRP). Data furnished by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions and the CIRP study are presented for: sex; age; race; religion; political orientation; parents' education; parents' income; high school grades; educational plans; probable career; college finances; college plans; important objectives; past activities; and opinions on social issues. Some highlights noted  are these: women comprised 57.1 percent of the 1978 entering freshman class as compared to 20.8 percent of the class that entered in 1966; average SAT scores declined from 1152 in 1966 to 1063 in 1978; high school grades have improved; and the annual income of entering freshmen rose substantially. It is concluded that the university continues to attract motivated students, the types of students have not changed drastically, and there is a need for additional research to determine the success of the students after graduation. Additional data covering CIRP findings for the years not reported are available in the Office of Institutional Research. Tables provide statistical breakdown of findings. (LC)",

It is recommended that new legislation be passed for better cash management by the government and for the return of excess funds. Interim measures for better cash management by the schools themselves are also suggested, including deposit of excess funds in interest-bearing accounts pending their return to the Treasury.  (ME)",

At the center of the debate are two definitions of fairness. On one side are the proponents of disclosure of the test instruments and results; on the other side are those who argue that test security ensures fairness. Proponents of the legislation believe that the principle of fairness outweighs technical objections to open testing. Opponents feel that supporters of the legislation should shoulder the burden of proof that the law is necessary.  Issues related to the testing controversy include: the role and power of American testing organizations; the nature, quality, and use of standardized tests; and the consequences of government interference. Also discussed are the legislation itself, its legal implications (constitutional, due process, copyright, freedom of information), initial impact, and strategies for evaluating the debate. Appended are the texts of the Gibbons Bill (H.R. 3564--the &quot;Truth in Testing Act of 1979&quot;), the Weiss Bill (H.R. 4949--the &quot;Educational Testing Act of 1979&quot;), and the California and New York state laws pertaining to admissions testing.

        "description":"In the 1980 election year, Cngress is likely to provide taxpayers with some form of tax savings, and observers predict that legislators will begin efforts to modify the Internal Revenue Code to provide more equity, gather more revenues, and serve a number of other purposes that will affect the higher education community. Particularly, higher education institutions will seek to preserve and broaden the provision that allows charitable contributions to colleges and universities to be deducted in calculating a donor's income tax. In addition, they have a strong interest in maintaining the tax-exempt status of scholarships and fellowships (Section 117). Tuition remission, presently regarded as tax-exempt, may be vulnerable during the tax review process. The concept of tax  expenditures is fundamental to the arguments on tax reform. Legislative history, cultural values, and current politics argue against any wholesale reform of the tax code, and yet piecemeal efforts to alter the code have been made and will continue. The higher education community views these efforts with concern, but has a powerful ally in other special interest groups, particularly in the nonprofit sector, that are also interested in encouragement of charitable giving.

Each group was presented a lesson on mathematical concepts. After the lesson each group was tested on comprehension of the concepts and the students evaluated the lesson presentation. The groups whose lessons contained no teacher vagueness or mazes performed better than those with vagueness. Student evaluations of the lessons indicated that  students were able to distinguish between lessons with high and lower degrees of clarity. Further, student evaluations of the lessons were correlated singificantly with student achievement. These findings are discussed in relation to previous research on teacher clarity and student perceptions of clarity. (Author/MSE)",

Both existing and planned involvement was found in 56 to 65 percent of the responding institutions. Those involved in these activities were tending to expand their involvement, while those not involved seemed to remain uninvolved; involved institutions tended to foster a variety of types of programs. A strong interest is shown in programs concerned with: faculty training in the use of a variety  of course presentation methods; administrative training in management techniques; and faculty training in the development and use of varied course material. Most institutions involved in professional development activities have shareable resources such as information, consultants, needs assessment instruments, learning packages, or taped programs. As the extent of involvement increases, so does the amount of these shareable resources. Graphs and charts show the distribution of programs and interest in the institutions surveyed. The survey instrument is appended. (MSE)",

The two preemptive sources of knowledge about faculty were doctoral dissertations and the research reports of academic social scientists. Other sources of knowledge about faculty are noted.

The University opposed a petition of the faculty union seeking certification as bargaining agent for the full-time faculty members of certain schools. Refusal by the University was on the ground that all of its faculty members are managerial or supervisory personnel and therefore not employees within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act. The National Labor Relations Board held that the faculty members are professional employees entitled to protection under the Act. The Board ordered the University to bargain and sought enforcement in the Court of Appeals, which denied the petition. The court held that the faculty members are endowed with  managerial status sufficient to remove them from the Act's coverage. The majority opinion of the Supreme Court, held by Justices Powell, Burger, Stewart, Rehnquist, and Stevens, found that the University's full-time faculty members are managerial employees excluded from the Act's coverage.

        "description":"The predicted declines in higher education enrollment coupled with continuing increases in costs have caused administrators to rethink the tradeoffs resulting from interinstitutional cooperation and competition. In considering alternate courses, five basic questions are addressed: (1) To what extent do institutions nationally engage in cooperative relationships?, (2) What should be considered in analyzing external relationships?, (3) What are the costs and benefits of cooperation?, (4) Are there significant educational benefits beyond cost advantages?, and (5) What role will cooperation play in the future? It is shown that increases in cooperative arrangements is part of a much larger movement to ever-increasing levels of centralization and interdependence, but that objectives,  longevity, and manageability must be balanced against administrative style, institutional size and resources, and the accruing costs and benefits. The underdeveloped state of methodology for quantifying costs and benefits makes precise answers to one of the most crucial questions difficult, and few examples are yet available. However, some nonquantifiable benefits have been identified: duplication avoidance, quality instruction, instructional diversity, increased access, additional funding sources, increased communication, alternative approaches, increased efficiency, greater planning and control, and leadership structures. It is concluded that an irreversible trend has begun. Appendices provide listings of major contributors to the Council for Interinstitutional Leadership-Carnegie  Corporation study of cooperative cost effectiveness, and of the 25 consortia and their member institutions that had one or more programs included as case studies in the analyses. A bibliography is also included. (MSE)",

The author's presentation addresses some of the assumptions made about special education, and the role of The Council for Exceptional Children regarding evaluation and accountability. Among the points made are the following: particularly in the case of mildly handicapped children, it is the environmental milieu of the family, the neighborhood, and the school, as well as the child's individual characteristics, that determine how the child fares in the classroom; professionals need to pursue program evaluation both on the full range of developmental characteristics of the child, and in the extent of our programmatic impact on  secondary institutions, such as the family and the schools; and The Council for Exceptional Children should see to it that special education leads the way in responsible and comprehensive self evaluation and self improvement.

In addition to cases relating specifically to language of instruction, those dealing with desegregation and racial or ethnic discrimination are reviewed. In decisions involving the teaching of foreign languages in elementary school, during the period 1923-1947, the trend was to invalidate state statutes prohibiting the teaching of foreign languages below the eighth grade. From 1950 on, court decisions have been consistent in trying to eliminate discrimination against black Americans in public schools. The period 1970-1973 saw Mexican American children identified as a minority group entitled to the protections announced in segregation cases. With Lau vs. Nichols, a decision ordering  relief in the form of special programs for limited English speaking students without specifying the form of relief opened an era of mandatory bilingual education that continues today if only because the Supreme Court has been silent on the subject since then. Since 1975, courts have directed school districts to accommodate the limited English speakers wherever substantial numbers of those speakers desired accommodation. The methodology of bilingual education has found its way into many cases. Finally, the few decisions dealing with the rights of illegal alien children have been divided. (JB)",

The second section reports on the research conducted in the study. Areas reviewed are methodology, the physical distribution in Quebec, choice of informants, the role of the researcher, and the interviewing of students and parents. These interviews sought to determine the attitudes of preadolescent, adolescent, and ten year old students in two different quarters of Quebec.  The discussion of results includes a transcription of an individual interview and sample questionnaires. The results indicate that the students expressed attitudes reflecting different levels of French language proficiency when comparing their own speech to their concept of a norm of proficiency. In analyzing variation in language use in both quarters of Quebec, it is concluded that linguistic behavior is tied into the social function of the speakers. (JK)",

Instruments currently used to assess language proficiency for placement in English programs usually fail validity and reliability tests. These tests usually measure formal aspects of language omitting the importance of function in communicative skills. The data used in this study are part of a larger study of language proficiency which includes six bilingual children at different levels of proficiency in both Spanish and English. The study is both qualitative and ethnographic in nature. The children's language repertoire was collected at school and in the community through the use of video and audio tapes and collected field  notes. The results of the analysis illustrate that only a small amount of the child's natural language repertoire is measured with tests currently used to measure language proficiency. The authors suggest that discourse analysis be used as a means for enhancing the measurement of language proficiency and for looking at communicative competence. Such analysis provides insight into what children are capable of, rather than what they are incapable of, doing linguistically. (Author/JK)",

        "description":"A conference of 15 experts in English as a second language (ESL) from Indochinese programs across the country arrived at a consensus regarding the characteristics of an effective ESL program. Prior to ESL instruction, student needs must be addressed, including basic living needs, orientation in the native language, and seeking the collaboration of various agencies. Refugees must be viewed as having special requirements. Program design will take into consideration such aspects of refugee background as ethnic origin, education, literacy, English proficiency, and individual goals. The setting for the program may be non-formal, a single multi-level class, a center, or an on-job site. The ESL instructional focus may be on survival training, literacy, basic skills, vocational  instruction, or English for specific occupational purposes. Each of these focuses is defined; clients to be served, method of delivery, intensity of instruction, program content, desirable outcome, and special considerations are all specified. All information is presented in outline form. (JB)",

These people inhabited a highland plateau cut by deep river valleys and bordered by seas, deserts, and jungles. Ethiopians have diverse backgrounds and speak many languages. Through their long history they have been largely free from outside domination, and have therefore developed a unique culture as evidenced by styles of food, dress, time measurement, and literature. Ethiopians in African refugee camps are for the most part illiterate and desperate. By contrast, the few thousand who have made their way to the United States are educated and anxious to get on with their lives. For all, however, the future is unknown. (Author)",

Their strong family structure serves their agricultural way of life. The language, though tonal, exhibits many similarities to English. Religious beliefs are animistic, centering around spirits of ancestors, the home, and nature. Mythological designs find their way into artwork, which is predominantly bodily adornments. The several names given to boys include a spirit name. Having been forced to move from place to place for centuries, the Mien are in general uneducated, though a few are conversant with Chinese and with the special knowledge needed by shamans. Recent contacts with other indigenous Southeast Asians, and with Americans, have  resulted in a slight broadening of the educational base. Mien customs, many centering around fear of evil spirits, should be known and respected by Americans responsible for their orientation in this country. Conversational customs are especially important to those who want to communicate with the Mien. Teachers of English as a second language should bear in mind certain characteristics of the Mien language, such as the small number of final consonants. (JB)",

The informants were two women, aged 89 and 80 years, and a man, aged 85. They were chosen because they were considered to be representative of speakers whose language would be least influenced by standard French and English. The research followed the theoretical principles and analytical methods of functional linguistics. In addition to the analysis of the phonological system and the comparisons, the report provides the following: (1) objectives of  the study, (2) a description of the region under study, (3) the present state of research on the phonological system of the Baie Sainte-Marie region, (4) the informants and the corpus of the study, and (5) a discussion of functionalism.

        "description":"The socioeconomic rationale of higher education provision in developing countries is examined by a review of the costs and benefits associated with investment in higher education as a whole and especially in different postsecondary subjects. University expenditures in developing countries typically account for less than 20 percent of the state budget for education, and an increasing part of this expenditure is devoted to technical and vocational subjects. This is indicated by the rising relative share of university enrollments in engineering, agriculture, and related fields of specialization. The international trend toward technical subjects is thought to reflect the notion that technical education contributes to economic development. The scientific basis of this notion is  examined by examining criteria for social choice in education: efficiency, equity, employment effects, social demand satisfaction, and flexibility benefits. Assessment of higher education costs at the aggregate university level and the subject field level permit an analysis of the behavior of unit costs as enrollment rises and documents cost differences between various university departments. The quantitative side of higher education benefits is analyzed, including the earning advantage of the graduates of different subjects, social demand satisfaction, income distribution, and employment prospects. Nonquantitative aspects of the choice between liberal and vocational education are addressed by reference to curriculum theory and the sociology of knowledge and change. The results suggest  that technical and general curriculum have their place in a balanced educational system. A bibliography and data for different countries are appended. (SW)",

Assumptions of rigidity of organizations, heterogeneity of managers, clarity of objectives, and instrumentality of action are viewed as inconsistent with experience and tending to lead theorists astray. Modifications in assumptions of management are suggested by examining change, clear goals, managers and managerial incentives, and instrumentality in administrative life. The following conclusions are made: (1) Organizations change routinely and continually, and the effectiveness of an organization's management and response to its environment is linked to the effectiveness of routine processes. As a result, much of the job of an administrator involves the mundane work of  making a bureaucracy work. (2) Some of the standard dicta that managers should define and pursue clear objectives need to be qualified by a recognition that clarity is sometimes a mistake and ambiguous preferences may be suitable. (3) Well-functioning organizations persistently produce a supply of nearly indistinguishable good managers and motivate managers to push themselves to the limit. (4) Administrators manage the way the sentiments, expectations, commitments, and faith of individuals concerned with the organization fit into a structure of social beliefs about organizational life. Administrators can affect organizations through their effect on the world views that surround organizational life. (CC)",

        "description":"The Medical University of South Carolina's financial management practices and its use of public resources and the adequacy of federal and state efforts to monitor the university's use of public resources were reviewed by the U.S. General Accounting Office. Specific weaknesses in the areas of equipment, entertainment expenses, and controlled substances were identified. One of the most significant weaknesses and one that has broad implications in terms of achieving effective management, was the lack of a good internal audit capability. The weaknesses that were identified have existed for several years without effective corrective action. External controls, including both federal and state audits, have been too limited and infrequent to monitor the university's use of public  resources, assess the university's accountability for federal and state funds, and assure corrective action on problems previously identified. It is recommended that the Secretary of Health and Human Services make any further federal funding contingent upon a satisfactory showing by the University that corrective action has been taken to ensure that internal controls are adequate to ensure proper accountability. GAO also recommends that the Secretary determine whether recovery should be made for that portion of the equipment that was purchased without federal approval, cannot be located, is not being used, and is being used outside the grant-supported area.

        "description":"The permanent order of deacon is proposed in the United Methodist Church. The following are suggestions for governing representative ministry so it can be structured to enliven and renew the life of United Methodism: (1) any view of diaconal and other representative ministries must be seen in relation to the general ministry of all Christians; (2) the calling of diaconal ministries (deacons) is essentially an enabling ministry for the larger body of Christians; (3) the order of deacon is an appropriate designation for the twentieth century; (4) ordination is historically a more accurate word to designate ministers who are set apart for service than is the word consecration; (5) annual conference membership for permanent deacons, without a guaranteed appointment and apart from the  itinerancy, is not as radical a departure from the present situation as it may initially seem to be; (6) for permanent deacons to be ordained and admitted to annual conference membership, educational requirements should be equivalent to those for ordination as elder; (7) ordination and conference membership for permanent deacons should be based on the same conditions in other areas as those which prevail for the eldership, including the intention of engaging in the full-time diaconate on a permanent basis. It is argued that ordination as a permanent deacon and admission to the annual conference are to be taken fully as seriously and to be handled with as much care as ordination to the order of elder. The provision for this process is in the 1980 Book of Discipline. (CC)",

        "description":"The status of the National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program is examined in this third annual report with cumulative data from inception of the program. The scholarship award includes the payment of a monthly stipend, tuition and fees, and other educational expenses in a federal program of service-conditional awards for students of allopathic and osteopathic medicine, dentistry, and other health professions. In return for each year of award, scholarship recipients must agree to serve one year providing clinical health care services in designated health manpower shortage areas of the United States. Appropriations for the 1979-80 academic year (fiscal year 1979) were $75 million, a $15 million increase over the previous year, with 7,399 applicants. Appropriations for the  seven award cycles from the 1973-74 academic year totaled $245.5 million. Awards for the 1979-80 academic year totaled 6,408, with 2,379 awards made to new recipients and 4,029 to former recipients. For the seven award cycles of the program, 22,670 awards have been made to 11,446 students. By the end of fiscal year 1979, 238 scholarship recipients had fulfilled their service obligation; 189 were physicians and 49 were dentists. During the 1979 fiscal year, 605 scholarship participants entered obligated service. Scholarship participants (8,910) still in training are expected to enter service obligations during the fiscal years 1980 through 1986. The service obligations of all recipients since the program began totals over 22,000 person-years. (CC)",

Hints for teaching and learning the case are given including the instructor role, preparation for discussion, and teaching tools. The first case study presented, by Douglas H. Gregg, examines the campus ministry's role in helping a new and controversial faculty member deal with a difficult academic issue.  The second case study, described by Alice Frazer Evans, looks at the role of a woman pastor in dealing with the problems of Iranian students on the campus shortly after the 1979 taking of American hostages in Iran. The final case study, also by Alice Frazer Evans, focuses on the issue of student desire for opportunities for worship at a state college. In each case study, ideas are presented for the uses of the case and areas for possible discussion. (MSE)",

        "description":"Experiences of the 1970s and prospects for the 1980s of colleges that had undergone enrollment decline and/or financial cutbacks were surveyed, based on visits to 20 colleges and universities in 11 states in the Northeast, Midwest, and South. Some of the strategies to resist and overcome decline have potential for success in a wide range of institutions, and the following approaches are generally low-cost and easily implemented: retention programs that deal with marginal students through special counseling and remedial programs and those that deal with students who may be dropping out for other than academic reasons; improving student life and campus climate; tightening standards and attracting bright students; and attracting new sources of revenue. While the decade of the 1970s  was predominantly one of resistance to enrollment decline, institutional leaders in the future increasingly will need to seek ways to adapt their organizational structures to a smaller scale of operations. Adapting successfully calls for careful planning in anticipation of decline, defining institutional mission, developing cost studies, and monitoring tenure levels. A sophisticated array of planning tools is needed to adapt successfully to decline: they must be applied to a process of internal reallocation of resources or contraction in absolute size and scope. A commitment and consensus from the faculty is important in initiating major reallocations or cutbacks. Reassessment efforts also involve developing review criteria. Adjusting to a smaller scale of operations involves adjusting  staffing practices, consolidating administrative structure, eliminating academic programs, and limiting course offerings of existing programs. The responses of specific colleges and universities are briefly described. (SW)",

Specific areas of analysis were the degree of professionalism of criminal justice educators, rankings of a series of selected publications, and the relationship between professionalism level and journal productivity. Data were derived from responses by 1,028 of 1,274 criminal justice educators who were mailed a 69-item questionnaire. All respondents were currently involved in teaching and/or research positions in the United States. Using a modified form of Hall's Professionalism Scale, the degree of professionalism was rated for the following subscales: use of the professional organization as a major referent, belief in public service, autonomy, belief in self-regulation, and sense of calling to the  field. A journal publication scale was developed to assess the respondents' journal productivity, taking into account both frequency of publishing and quality of publication. Journal weights (means and standards deviations) were calculated for each of the selected publications, and then weights were calculated separately for members of two professional organizations. The findings revealed that the criminal justice occupation lies in the upper-middle quadrant on the professions continuum (based on professionalism level scores). Extensive variation was found among the rankings of the selected criminal justice publications, and the relationship between professionalism level and journal productivity was negligible. The survey questionnaire and Hall's modified Professionalism Scale are  appended. (SW)",

Proposed initiatives with specific focus groups are organized under four thrusts: family economic stability and security, energy and environment; food, nutrition, and health; and family strengths and social environment. An implementation plan was developed for each initiative, with suggested performers, integration of research, extension, and  higher education activities, and two-, five-, and ten-year targets for the proposed plan. The plan rests on three premises: home economics, human nutrition, and family living form an integral part of food and agriculture; priority needs of the clientele are known; and federal leadership and support are vital to a strong research and education program. The program purpose of each new initiative and the proposed clientele are based on analysis and recommendations of earlier studies and the assessment and review by users, scientists, educators, and administrators. Background information for each thrust is presented, which includes: present national situation, assumptions on which proposed initiatives were based, and implications for new program initiatives.

The 1980 normative data are based on responses from 187,124 freshmen entering 355 institutions, of which 19 were new and 336 old participants. Four-year colleges are included in the national norms if over 85 percent of their first-time, full-time freshmen completed the Student Information Form (SIF); universities must have over 75 percent participation, while two-year colleges must have 50 percent. The normative data were collected by administering the 1980 SIF during registration, freshman orientation, or the first few weeks of classes. The SIF is designed to elicit a wide  range of biographic and demographic data, as well as data on the student's high school background, career plans, educational aspirations, financial arrangements, high school activities, and current attitudes. Those data meeting minimal quality requirements for inclusion in the 1980 norms were differentially weighted to represent the population of entering freshmen at all higher educational institutions in the United States. Part-time students and those who are not first-time college students (i.e., transfers and former enrollees) were excluded from the normative sample. The normative data are reported separately for women and men, and for 39 different groupings of institutions. The major stratifying factors are institutional race (predominantly black versus predominantly white); type  (two-year college, four-year college, university); control; and the selectivity level of the institution. Information on weighting procedures and research design and a sample SIF are included. (SW)",

Engineering is the field with the greatest concentration of foreign students. Although all students in a given discipline may be required to complete a core of common courses, each doctoral student's program is developed as a result of extensive discussion between student and adviser. However, masters' programs attempt to guarantee uniformity of background through prescribed sequences of courses rather than allowing modifications to suit the needs of the individual student. A problem is that engineering and business  education, fields important to developing countries, are in this country embedded in the American cultural, political, and economic system. Sources of financial support for foreign students may be limited since some departments are reluctant to award teaching assistantships to students from nonEnglish-speaking countries, and research assistantships often are not available to first-year students. Information that should be provided to foreign students applying to U.S. graduate schools, the assessment of the student's preparation and English proficiency, and orientation and academic advising needs of foreign students are addressed.

        "description":"The availability of evening and weekend baccalaureate degree credit courses and factors that discourage institutions from introducing or expanding such courses were investigated through a fast response survey that was sent to a national sample of universities and other four-year colleges. Among the findings are the following: almost three-fourths of the baccalaureate degree-granting institutions offered degree-credit courses in evening or on weekends during the 1979-80 academic year; evening courses were provided most frequently; an estimated 20 percent of all institutions offered enough evening and weekend courses to fulfill all degree requirements in at least one of the 11 major fields of study covered in the survey; for specific fields of study, the proportions of institutions  providing all required credits in evening or weekend courses ranged from one percent for home economics to 25 percent of business and management; and next most widely available degree programs were in the fields of psychology and social sciences; opportunities to earn degrees through evening or weekend study tended to increase with enrollment size; and insufficient demand was perceived as the major deterrent to the introduction or expansion of evening and weekend courses (limited faculty resources ranked second as a deterrent, and neighborhood or transportation safety was the least frequently cited factor). Additionally two-thirds of the institutions with evening or weekend courses provided evening classes only, while one-third offered classes both in evenings and on weekends. A sample  questionnaire and information on the survey methodology are appended. (SW)",

The survey sample consisted of 3,270 accredited institutions and branches and an additional 141 systems and central offices. Eighty more institutions/branches had accreditation during the 1980-81 school year than the previous year. Private two-year schools accounted for more than two-thirds of the increase, and the balance was dominated by a rise in the number of public two-year institutions. Data are presented indicating the growth in the number of institutions and their branches participating in the HEGIS program during the past decade. Increases in the number of public institutions outpaced that of their  private counterparts until 1977, and since that time, private institutions have been added at a ratio of nearly five to one over public institutions. Information is also provided on: the number of institutions by state, control, level, sex of student body, and calendar system. The number of institutions by control and level accredited by each of the recognized accrediting agencies is also indicated, along with information on administrative staff, dates of establishment of institutions, and the number with summer or evening programs. The low turnover rates among selected administrative staff indicate the possibility of increased stability among the deans and directors of the various academic programs. Nearly two thirds of these positions had a lower turnover rate than the previous year.  (SW)",

Over 100 articles were selected, plus books and monographs published between 1970 and 1980. The articles were grouped according to whether they dealt with cognition and learning; instruction; student characteristics; or the organization and operation of the university from a psychological viewpoint. Within each topic area, a further discrimination was made between whether the articles were theories and experimental findings, or methods and measurements. Two-thirds of the research was done in the areas of cognition and learning or instruction, with the greatest emphasis on teaching methods and the evaluation of teaching. Research in  cognition and learning focused on modes of learning and on the actual process of learning and thinking. In the category of instruction, teaching goals and factors and the interaction of instruction and cognition were focal topics. Methods at this level were concerned with the effects of different teaching methods, the training of teaching assistants, and the evaluation of teaching. At the level of student characteristics, achievement and development factors were prominent, and methods for selecting and upgrading students were found. At the most global level, the organization and operation of the university, the principal topics were staff development and psychology in the university, and the methods dealt with special programs in higher education, and evaluation in and of the university.  It is suggested that most of the work with concrete and abstract learning has not been applied to knowledge as it is found in university programs. A bibliography is appended. (SW)",

        "description":"The involvement of state agencies in program discontinuance in higher education was studied, based on the responses of 46 agencies. It was found that 32 state agencies were actively involved in recommending, initiating, or enforcing actual discontinuances. The following eight categories of obstacles to program discontinuance were identified: legal aspects, interactive issues, economic issues, political issues, definitional shortcomings, attitudinal issues, procedural issues, and environmental issues. Among the strategies that were followed to cope with obstacles to program discontinuance were the following: announcing a new era that is advertised with a slogan such as \"smaller and better\"; developing program discontinuance guidelines; stimulating programmatic change via  trade-offs (e.g., approving new programs without allocating additional funds); assisting in developing hiring ceilings; developing standards and norms for the purpose of lending objectivity to the decision-making process; and promoting the establishment of faculty retraining centers. A coping-process model and a time-order sequence for implementation are proposed, which consists of three phases: incentives to induce reduction, general coping devices, and rewards for the effective implementation of curricular retrenchment. Additionally, roles for the institutional researcher in the closure process may include the following: assist in conceptualizing a university-level program review process in line with the institution's degree of centralization or decentralization, and identify  appropriate data and estimate the cost and time involved in retrieving and interpreting them.

Institutional research office benefits include a capacity to comprehend, combine, and analyze data resulting from the several operational activities of the college or university. Responsibilities of such an office include: responding to national statistical surveys or requests for data or information, contacting the state agency for higher  education on matters relating to institutional data, serving on relevant statewide committees, collection and contributing to higher education periodicals, and contributing advice on planning and policy. Methods and techniques of IR are discussed in terms of the assumptions made, communications findings, research interpretation, information management, comparative analysis, data exchange, and modeling.

The Reagan Administration's proposed budget cuts are condemned for jeopardizing equal opportunity and access to education. Active AAUP membership as of June ll, 1981, totaled 66,774, an increase of 9,612 since January 1981. The AAUP budget moved from a large deficit in 1979 to a surplus in 1980, and a surplus is projected for 1981. AAUP chapters at 57 institutions consisting of 104 campuses, hold collective bargaining rights. The association's chief targets for winning bargaining  elections in the coming year are the Twin Cities campus of the University of Minnesota with more than 2,200 faculty, and the 19-campus California State College and Universities System with some 21,000 faculty. The 44-member assembly of state conferences criticized the difficulty of enrolling younger faculty members due to competition from the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers. The assembly succeeded in establishing a reduced membership fee for nontenured faculty for the first two years of academic employment. The AAUP unanimously adopted a resolution calling on state governments to reject &quot;creation-science&quot; legislation that requires &quot;balanced treatment&quot; of &quot;creation-science&quot; and evolution in public schools. AAUP statistics show that the average salary  of instructional personnel from universities to two-year colleges for 1980 to 1981 was $23,650. (CC)",

The typical UMCP freshman was from an upper-middle class home, earned at least a B average in high school, and was optimistic in his or her expectations of academic and social life at college. The typical freshman planned to live in the university residence halls and expected to become involved in student activities, but did not plan to work during the school year. Thirty-three percent of the students surveyed stated that getting a better job was their main reason for going to college. UMCP in particular was chosen mostly for  its good academic reputation (by 29 percent of the students) and its low tuition (14 percent). It was the initial choice of school for most of those surveyed; 55 percent indicated UMCP as their first choice and 24 percent as their second choice. Compared to national norms, the 1980 freshman class at UMCP was similar to entering freshmen at other public universities. A shared concern was their ability to finance their college education. Demographically, the UMCP sample was slightly different from the national sample in that it included somewhat more minority students and was somewhat more affluent. (Author/LBL)",

        "description":"The purpose of the Center for Helping Organizations Improve Choice in Education (CHOICE) project, the scope of its activities, and evaluations of the effectiveness of those activities are described. One major project goal was to encourage and facilitate institutional efforts to provide more complete and accurate information to prospective students. Project activities were organized in six primary areas: work with participating institutions, national clearinghouse on student consumer information, research on the role of information on student college choice, national linking service, dissemination activities, and impact on federal and state policy regarding student information. Research projects that pertained to the role of information in students' college choice concerned: the  effectiveness and accuracy of college admissions practices; a case study of influences on students' college choice; and an assessment of college recruitment literature. Institutional outcomes for the 10 participating institutions in Project CHOICE include: the creation and development of new publications or products (e.g., films); the revision or expansion of existing publications; and the use of data for internal decision-making purposes. Goals of the linking service include: making low-cost consulting services available to institutions that wished to review and improve the information they provide to students, and to attract and involve a second-wave of 60 participating institutions. The staffing and location of Project CHOICE at the University of Michigan are described. Dissemination  activities are described and suggestions for the management of large-scale, multi-institutional projects are given. (SW)",

        "description":"The current status of minority enrollment in higher education and specific concerns that affect students and the institution are examined. Minority enrollment at different institutional levels, in different fields of study, and over different periods of time is examined. Findings reveal a more complex pattern of gains and slowdowns than gross statistics for the last decade indicate. Hispanics and women continue to increase their share of the total enrollment, but blacks experience a slackening momentum. The policy framework created by legislation and litigation on issues affecting student access is considered, and the following three related issues are examined: the pool of minority applicants; designing more equitable admission procedures; and retaining minority students through  graduation. Minority groups, especially blacks and Hispanics, suffer from inadequate secondary school preparation and counseling and from economic and psychometric barriers. They are disproportionately overrepresented in two-year institutions and underrepresented in four-year colleges and graduate and professional schools. Measures of particular applicability to specific minority group concern must reflect a sensitivity to an institution's own makeup and institutional role. Such measures require an internal system of data gathering to indicate enrollment trends and retention problems; recruitment of faculty and professional staff trained in teaching or counseling poorly prepared students and sensitive to diverse minority group needs; and development of campus services responsive to the  linguistic and cultural traditions of minority students.

Institutional advancement includes alumni relations, fund-raising, public relations, internal and external communications, and government relations, and its dominant concern is financial support of higher education and the institution. Changes in the perception of advancement have occurred over the last decade, and it has emerged as an essential and professional segment of university administration. Additionally, there has been increased cooperation within and among institutions with regard to advancement functions. Diverse trends are cited that have resulted in heightened interest in the  management of advancement and new emphasis on the process and outcomes of advancement. Strategies for advancement programs are as follows: effective management of an institution's assets; focusing on the prestige of the institution; educational marketing; and flexible management, an eclectic approach incorporating a concept of dynamic advancement and the selected application of management principles. Centrally managed, a strategy for advancement confronts four challenges: designing quality public relations programs; restructuring activities to involve the institution's many publics; redesigning fund-raising campaigns to be cost effective and to achieve optimum results within the constraints of competition, inflation, and tax laws; and coordinating objectives, program, resources, and  contacts.

        "description":"This discussion of the kind of knowledge acquired by a novice learning BASIC programming and how this knowledge may be most efficiently acquired suggests that people who do programming acquire three basic skills that are not obvious either in instruction or in traditional performance: (1) the ability to analyze each statement into a type of prestatement, (2) the ability to enumerate the transactions involved for each prestatement, and (3) the ability to chunk prestatements into general clusters or configurations. The instructional implications of a psychological analysis of the basic concepts underlying performance in BASIC programming are considered, and an alternative instructional approach--the &quot;transactional approach&quot;--is recommended for teaching programming. This approach  involves teaching the underlying concepts of transactions, prestatements, and chunks using a concrete model of the computer, before emphasizing hands-on learning. It is argued that once the student has acquired the relevant subsuming concepts, the relationship between program and output will be more meaningful. Nine references are listed, and appendices include the eight levels of knowledge for BASIC; examples of transactions, prestatements, and chunks and diagrams of the traditional and transactional approaches. Other publications in this report series are listed. (MER)",

        "description":"A study designed to serve as an initial step in building a theory of computer literacy was conducted to provide new information concerning how humans think about calculators and to determine how individual differences in students' intuitions affect their understanding and use of the calculator. Thirty-three expert and 33 novice calculator users were asked to fill out questionnaires, and then to predict what number would be in the display of the calculator after a series of key presses for 88 math problems. Analytic techniques of cognitive psychology were applied to assess the performance of the subjects compared to the performance of the calculators, as well as subject performance in light of the type of calculator used, and the amount of previous experience with calculators.  Results indicated that there were tremendous individual differences among users in their interpretations of the logic of the calculator's operating system. Future work is recommended to determine whether intuitions, once diagnosed, can be altered through instruction, and to determine whether people with certain intuitions can use their calculators more creatively or learn a new computer language more efficiently than people with other sets of intuition.

        "description":"A review of the research on techniques for increasing the novice's understanding of computers and computer programming, this paper considers the potential usefulness of five tentative recommendations pertinent to the design of computer literacy curricula: (1) provide the learner with a concrete model of the computer; (2) encourage the learner to actively restate the new technical information in his or her own words; (3) assess the learner's existing intuitions about computer operation and try to build on or modify them; (4) provide the learner with methods for chunking statements into smaller, meaningful parts; and (5) provide the learner with methods for analyzing statements into smaller, meaningful parts. It is concluded that, while results of cognitive research provide  qualified support for the first two recommendations, more active research is needed on the other three.

        "description":"This discussion of the advantages and limitations of raster graphics systems points out that until recently, most computer graphics systems have been oriented toward the display of line drawings, continually refreshing the screen from a display list of vectors. Developments such as plasma panel displays and rapidly declining memory prices have now made feasible raster graphics systems, which instead associate some memory with each point on the screen and display points according to the contents of the memory. It is explained that raster systems permit operations which are not feasible on vector displays, such as reading directly from the screen as well as writing on it, and manipulating two-dimensional areas and vectors. Conceptual differences between programming for raster and  vector systems are illustrated with a description of the TV Turtle, a graphics system for raster scan video display terminals. This system is imbedded in LOGO, a Lisp-like interactive programming language designed for use by children, and is based on LOGO's turtle geometry approach to graphics. LOGO, it is noted, provides powerful ideas for using graphics which are easy for children to learn, yet generalize naturally when advanced capabilities such as primitives for animation and color are added to the system.

In the education context, an editor has been implemented that encourages students to define and debug programs in terms of explicit design choices. The editor provides a structured programming environment based on a detailed theory of the processes involved in coherently structured problem solving. In the AI context, an automatic programmer called PATN was designed using an augmented transition network embodiment of the SPADE  theory. This resulted in a unified framework which clarified work on planning and debugging by Sacerdoti and Sussman. In the psychology context, a parser called PAZATN has been designed that applies the SPADE theory to the analysis of programming protocols to produce a parse delineating the planning and debugging strategies used by the problem solvers. Hand-simulations of PATN and PAZATN on elementary programming problems and informal experiments with the SPADE editor demonstrate the effectiveness of the theory in accounting for a wide range of planning and debugging techniques.

The design of SPADE is based upon the development of a grammar of plans from a taxonomy of basic planning techniques. The utility of this approach to program definition is that a record of planning decisions, called the plan derivation, provides guidance for subsequent modification or debugging of the program. Moreover, this grammatical approach to planning allows the development of a taxonomy of bugs, as particular kinds of errors in applying the planning grammar. Following a linguistic analogy, five types of planning bugs are characterized: syntactic, semantic, pragmatic,  circumlocutions, and slips of the tongue. The plan derivation can be accessed during subsequent debugging to aid in diagnosing the underlying cause of erroneous code. Repair is accomplished via replanning, in which a substructure of the derivation is replaced. The design of a debugging assistant for the SPADE environment called RAID is based on this theory.

PATN's plans may manifest &quot;rational bugs,&quot; which result from heuristically justifiable but incorrect arc transitions in the planning ATN.

In order to explore PATN's potential as a theory of human problem solving, a linguistic approach to protocol analysis is presented. An interpretation of a protocol is taken to be a parse tree supplemented by semantic and pragmatic annotation attached to various nodes. This paradigm has implications for constructing a cognitive model of the individual and designing computerized tutors. Manual protocol analysis is tedious and informal; hence the design for PAZATN, an automatic protocol analyzer, is presented. PAZATN uses PATN as a generator for possible interpretations of the protocol, with bottom-up evidence biasing PATN toward plans which are likely to  match the data. PAZATN is a domain independent framework for constructing specialized protocol analyzers. To apply PAZATN to a particular task domain, event specialists (ESP's) are needed which embody syntactically organized domain knowledge. ESP's for the LOGO graphics programming domain are defined and PAZATN's operation is hand-simulated on an elementary protocol for this domain. Forty-one references are listed. (Author/LLS)",

The Wumpus Advisor program offers advice to a player involved in choosing the best move in a game for which competence in dealing with incomplete and uncertain knowledge is required. The design and implementation of the advisor explores a new paradigm in computer assisted instruction, in which the performance of computer based tutors is greatly improved through the application of artificial intelligence techniques. The advisor acts as an interface between the student and the game, intervening whenever the student's moves show that s/he  needs advice. Advice is given as English discourse explaining in full the merits and faults of particular moves. Twelve references are listed. (Author/LLS)",

        "description":"This paper is a preliminary proposal to develop the theory and design for &quot;coaches&quot; for computer games, to implement prototypes, and to experiment with their ability to convey important intellectual skills. The focus of this project will be restricted to developing a coach for a single example of an intellectual game called Wumpus. It is pointed out that, while computer games have a powerful educational appeal, they also have a limitation in that the player, on his own, can fail to acquire the skills of an expert. A computer coach, which could provide advice on strategy and tactics for better play and tutor basic mathematical, scientific, or other kinds of knowledge related to the game, could overcome that limitation. The project would address three specific questions: (1) how  the expertise can be designed in the coach so that it can respond reasonably to the player's particular choice of move; (2) how the player can be modeled sufficiently so that the coach's remarks are appropriate, i.e., neither too advanced for a beginner nor too elementary for an expert; and (3) how the nature of the coach's advice can be controlled so that it is given in a friendly and personal manner. Fifty-six references are listed. (Author/LLS)",

The first one discussed is the effects of concrete models on people's understanding and learning of new technical information such as computer programming. Research results provide evidence that a concrete model can have a strong effect on the encoding and use of new technical information by novices. The second technique for increasing the meaningfulness of technical information was elaboration or encouraging the learner to explain the information in his or her own words, and to relate the material to other ideas or concepts. Research findings reveal that, although there is no fool-proof way to design useful  elaboration activities, learners should be able to describe the effects of each program statement in his own words. The issue of what to teach to enhance a novice's understanding of computer programming is also discussed in terms of knowledge for understanding a statement and a program.

The studies yielded information on staff communication concerns, especially with respect to personnel development, job effectiveness, and the systematization of communication methods and procedures. Changes in organizational communication patterns resulting from recommendations implemented in the libraries which conducted internal studies centered on these same areas. Though most of the libraries took some action in each area, management and organizational factors affected the  success of implementation. Easily implemented recommendations dealt with personnel and job effectiveness issues, while the difficult to implement recommendations were those related to the standardization or centralization of communication functions. Study of the decisions surrounding the adoption of AACR2 revealed that clear management expectations provide a basis for communication between individual service units and establish a central responsibility for the communication of plans and decisions. Suggestions for improving organizational communications in academic libraries are appended. (JL)",

        "description":"In their study of the usage demands placed on journal collections in academic libraries, Allen Kent and coauthors have not adequately considered the long-term variability of those demands in their formulation of a cost-benefit model for the management of journal collections. Though resource-sharing and the matching of periodical acquisitions to usage patterns can yield significant budgetary savings, the data gathering and data analysis techniques employed in Kent's study have limitations for predicting future use patterns and for making acquisitions decisions. The study fails to account for biases in usage patterns attributable to cyclical demands through the service day and academic year, and also fails to consider the intensity of journal use--quickly scanning an item counted  as equivalent to reading it for several hours. Another shortcoming is the costly, labor-intensive aspect of Kent's technique: interviewers were used to contact individual journal users. Generalizing obsolescence rates over a group of titles is also questionable, for frequency of use as a function of age differs substantially between core and other journals with specific disciplines. Kent's study is useful in its development of a model for studying journal use, even though his methods are not satisfactory. (JL)",

After Chapter I reviews recent criticism of education, it goes on to identify problems in the performance of our educational system and to propose that a student development perspective on education provides a framework for individualizing education. In addition to tracing the origins of student development, Chapter II delineates the student development education (SDE) model, which involves administrators, teachers, and counselors in a competency-based process of goal setting; assessment; use of change strategies in instruction, consultation, and milieu management; and evaluation. Chapter III provides theoretical support for this model in a review of  the literature on developmental learning and moral, personal-social, physical, and individual development. Chapter IV discusses an attempt to implement the SDE model in the Police Science program at a two-year college and reviews the problems, challenges, and outcomes of this effort. Chapter V presents the results of a nationwide study of the current use of student development in colleges and universities. Chapter VI concludes with a summary of the problems and issues of evaluation. The monograph is appended by the questionnaire used in the student development survey, a history of the development of competencies for a Black History course, and a description of the SDE curriculum at El Centro College.

        "description":"This report provides an in-depth profile of the students enrolled in the 57 community colleges and technical institutes of the North Carolina Community College System during the spring of 1979. After an introductory section identifying key issues and describing the research problem and objectives, the study methodology is described. Next, student profiles based on a statewide sample of more than 16,000 students are presented for the community college students in general and for curriculum and continuing education students. These profiles cover demographic, socioeconomic, academic, and attendance characteristics, and, in addition, provide information on sources of influence and information, students' value orientation toward education, education and employment plans, and feelings  about the standard use of community college as the designation for all institutions in the system. Next, demographic and socioeconomic comparisons are made between curriculum and continuing education students and North Carolina's projected 1979 adult population. The subsequent sections examine profile changes in the curriculum and continuing education student populations over the last ten years. After enrollment and population changes are compared, the report presents a summary analysis of the findings. Appendices provide the survey instrument and other information related to the study methodology and results. (AYC)",

        "description":"Community colleges, in a quest for increased enrollments and expanded educational access, seem less concerned with quality than they were 15 years ago. This is evidenced by the move toward open enrollments, reduced academic requirements, promotion of sporadic course-taking patterns, and vocational, as opposed to general, education. Adjustments have been made to accommodate student preference for video instructional modes, to compensate for the deterioration of the secondary curriculum, and to give acceptable grades. While many factors are beyond the college's authority, standards, requirements, and grades are all within the college's control. Colleges have a responsibility to examine the effects of curricular shifts to pre-college-level course work, of allowing the level of  transfer courses to deteriorate, and of promoting intermittent rather than sequential curricular structures and student attendance patterns. Data is available to help colleges focus on the effects of these kinds of policy decisions and to enable them to answer those who question whether these decisions are in the best interest of the community. An additional responsibility of the college is the promotion and maintenance of the liberal arts, not only within transfer programs, but also within vocational programs, and even as the basis for a liberal arts career major. The next decade will bring many changes and an increased demand for accountability that will force colleges to pay more attention to the business of education. (AYC)",

After an introduction on the issue of humanistic literacy and the preparation of this publication, the three papers in Section I suggest ways in which remediation and humanistic education can be combined. The first essay, \"Homer's 'Odyssey' and Humanistic Education: Towards a Theory of the Humanities,\" by Clay A. Boland, Jr., discusses the \"Odyssey\" as a source of descriptive definitions of humanism, humanist, and humanistic education. \"The American Musical: A Value-Reflecting Ritual,\" by Wayne H. Freeman, explores the social values and cultural changes reflected  in this art form. In \"Community Colleges and Literacy,\" Donald B. Epstein traces the history of literacy training and reviews the Guided Studies Program at Clackamas Community College (OR) which links the humanities with the life experiences of nontraditional students. The papers in Section II describe remedial programs with a humanistic emphasis. Margaret Byrd Boegeman, in \"Autobiography in English Composition,\" describes the use of autobiographical writing in developing language skills and promoting self-awareness and self-confidence. \"Learning to Write Sentence by Sentence: A Modular Approach to English Composition,\" by Peter L. Sharkey, examines the College of Marin's (CA) course, which emphasizes thesis, tone, and point of view. (KL)",

A two-year course of study, IDS brings together literature, mathematics, social science, natural science, philosophy, rhetoric, religion, art, architecture, and music within a historical framework. The program concentrates on the major developments in Western intellectual history and their modern implications, with the purpose of creating an enlightened and liberated citizenry. This is accomplished by focusing on the thinking, integrating, and communicating skills and processes by which knowledge is acquired. The success of the IDS program has been  contributed to by a unified philosophy of general education, instructors' knowledge of classroom techniques, and a team of dedicated, experienced generalists. This success has been attested to by the transfer, business, and general interest students who have completed the program.

The paper begins by briefly describing a project which MATC undertook in 1965 through 1970 to develop technical mathematics materials and courses which were relevant for technicians and matched the entry-level skills and learning speed of the students. It goes on to describe the development of MATC's Crossover Program, which provides basic skills courses to prepare students for entry into technical career programs. After describing the courses and placement procedures used in the General, Health, and Technical Crossover Programs, the paper presents a report on the materials, methods, and results of one section of arithmetic, taught during the  summer of 1980. This report describes the MATC-developed module series, the use of diagnostic pretests, the instructional format, and student attrition. It then analyzes student performance, presenting test items which were answered correctly by 100% of the students completing the math course and items which were performed correctly by less than 67% of the students. Each subject area on the final exam is then examined in terms of the number of students performing items correctly. Finally, the report presents a discussion of students' negative attitudes towards mathematics, including samples of student comments about their feelings toward math. (KL)",

The review begins by presenting statistics on the magnitude of the adult literacy problem in the United States, citing information such as: over 57 million adults in America not enrolled in high school have less than a high school education; almost 23 million Americans between the ages of 18 and 65 do not have skills adequate to perform basic tasks such as addressing a letter; and there is an incredible gap between the number of persons who need literacy programs and those who were actually receiving it. Next, efforts to reduce adult illiteracy are summarized, at the national and state levels. The paper then traces the growing involvement of community colleges  in ABE, citing reasons community colleges want responsibility for ABE and following the transfer of control over ABE functions from the secondary schools to the community colleges. The next two sections focus on the characteristics of ABE students and instructors. After a section on the levels of instruction and other factors affecting the effectiveness of ABE classes, the paper reviews funding considerations, such as costs, federal and state support, and special grant programs. The final section assesses the role of ABE within the context of the community college mission. A bibliography follows the resource review. (AYC)",

Joseph Rossmeier places his discussion of information resource management in the context of the growing importance of computers, the role of information as a  primary institutional asset, and a hierarchy of information needs. M. Kathryne Baratta examines the use of student data in planning and for better management. The utilization of student information systems is further discussed by Toni Hall and Jim Reed, who recommend a planned approach to student follow-up, strategies for organizing research and promoting data utilization, and ways that decision makers should use student information. Mike Stevenson and Dan Walleri present nine guidelines for financial decision making in a period of retrenchment.

Next, the report  presents recommendations for assessment, placement, and the determination of course prerequisites. A required counseling component and a probation policy for students whose progress is unsatisfactory are outlined in the next section of the report, which is followed by recommendations for awarding credit for developmental work. After providing job descriptions for necessary staff, the report concludes with recommendations for implementing the program, which suggest funding sources.

In the context of peer relationships, children's development continues to progress as children expand their experiences and increase their knowledge. Three major directions in the research are examined: the first section of this chapter provides a review of the major theoretical perspectives and empirical research on children's peer relationships in child development. In the second section, the findings of this research are related to questions that educators and parents may ask as they observe peer interaction in the classroom, home, or neighborhood. Throughout these two sections the  implications for children's social experience in the school and at home are discussed and future research directions are proposed. In the last section, the role of adults in the development of children's peer relationships is reviewed according to available evidence, and methods for supporting and instructing children in peer relationship development are discussed. Various types of curriculum activity are then examined for their potential influence on peer relationships, especially those relationships between children of different ages, races, sexes, and abilities.

Theoretical explanations of child abuse are classified as either unitary or interactive. Unitary theories (psychological, sociological, and legal views of behavior) are considered deficient; none is capable of explaining individuals or families who theoretically ought to be child abusers but are not. Each unitary theory's specific inadequacies are mentioned. Interactive theories explain child abuse as a symptom of disturbance in a complex ecosystem with interacting variables and account for those individuals who do not abuse children despite the presence in their lives of factors normally associated with child abuse. The interactive context leads to  suggestions regarding prevention. Three myths of child abuse prevention are noted: professionals are the key to preventing and curing child abuse; efficient screening prevents child abuse; and prevention of child abuse will require a social revolution. Several prevention measures are mentioned, including changes in social policy regarding child abuse, parent education about child development, mutual support groups, crisis lines, emergency child care services, accessible health care for children, and dissemination of information about child abuse.

        "description":"Although not the preferred type of family formation, conjugal succession is now an accepted, if not expected, alternative to continuous marriage in the United States. This new trend appears to be related to a shift in the meaning of matrimony. Previously, marriage was part of a cultural pattern of transitions and as such was closely timed to movement out of the household, transition from virginity, establishment of a new household, and entrance to parenthood. Marriage has now become more voluntary, flexible, and conditional--in short, tailored to fit a less uniform and predictable life course. Evidence indicates that successful second marriages have most of the same features as successful first marriages. But if the pattern of conjugal succession has not altered marriage  expectations, it certainly has changed the structure of marriage for most remarried couples. A new family form has emerged which has been called the binuclear, blended, or reconstituted family. While very little is known about how formerly married and currently married partners share the responsibility of raising children, it seems plausible that remarried couples must invent a code of etiquette for conducting relationships with others to whom they have no legal or biological ties. (In conclusion, findings of a few rare studies focusing on aspects of parenting, social relationships, and child rearing in the context of the binuclear family are summarily reported, and a current national longitudinal survey of the impact of marital disruption on children and families is briefly discussed.

        "description":"After a brief overview of theory related to motor skill development in children, an update on approaches to motor development assessment and programming is provided. Descriptive/product, process-oriented/diagnostic, process/descriptive, and reflex testing approaches taken in motor ability assessment are reviewed, and some of the strengths and limitations of each approach are discussed. In the descriptive or product-oriented approach a group of motor tasks is selected, and each child's performance is compared with the average performance of children in his or her age group. The process-oriented or diagnostic approach consists of evaluating tasks which are indicative, in theory, of an underlying process of motor performance. In the third approach children's activities are observed,  and their performance is judged on the basis of a qualitative analysis of their movement patterns. Reflex testing evaluates children on the bases of the appearance and/or inhibition of certain reflex movements according to age level. In conclusion, three approaches to programming motor activities for the young child--including traditional, movement education, and perceptual approaches--are delineated and contrasted. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Studies from several countries are described in this review of literature pertinent to assigning day care children to multi-age or homogeneous age groups. Three issues are discussed in this regard: (1) What difference does it make how one groups children? The answer is that a profound difference to children, staff, and parents may occur in terms of social environment, curriculum design, success at school, and other factors. (2) What aspects of the child's development are affected by age grouping? The answer is that multi-age grouping positively influences social, emotional, and some learning outcomes, whereas homogeneous grouping seems to produce mastery of academic skills. Success of particular grouping choices depends on the end desired and on the skills of staff members. (3)  How does age grouping affect the achievement of preschool goals? The answer to this question ultimately can be provided only by a center's staff and the families being served. Because research is still being conducted on the effects of grouping children under 6 years of age, the decision to place children in multi-age or homogeneous groups depends on program goals, client characteristics, center resources, and staff training and inclinations.

        "description":"The recognition that children's cognitive skills are evident in visual as well as verbal conventions has led to the construction of the Silver Test of Cognitive and Creative Skills (STCCS) for the assessment and development of children's cognitive abilities. Research on cognition, the role of language in cognition, and left and right brain hemisphere thinking has led to the following conclusions: (1) even children with inadequate language may be able to construct visual models of reality and represent their experiences nonverbally by drawing images of them; (2) intellectual ability is largely independent of language; (3) language is structured by the development of logical ability; (4) people tend to favor one mode of hemispheric thinking over another; and (5) individuals  successful at solving problems tend to use visual thinking as one means of solving problems. Based on findings such as these, the STCCS consists of three main tasks: drawing from imagination, drawing from observation, and predictive drawing. The test is designed to assess children with cognitive or creative strengths who may do poorly on traditional measures of intelligence or achievement. Examples of the use of the STCCS in assessment are provided. Teaching procedures derived from three structures underlying the assessment tasks are described and illustrated. In conclusion, six studies using the STCCS to assess or to develop children's cognitive skills are summarily discussed. (Author/RH)",

The first three sections of the paper discuss the age at which racial attitudes begin to form, the developmental antecedents of racial attitudes from infancy through age 3 years, and the measurement and meaning of racial awareness. The major portion of the document discusses various social and psychological factors underlying the development of racial attitudes. The factors discussed include direct instruction, reinforcement, personality characteristics of parents and children, child rearing techniques, cognitive aspects and perceptual components of racial attitudes,  socialization, and the relative salience of racial cues in contrast to other cues such as gender and age. The concluding section of the paper explores parallels between the acquisition of racial and other attitudes and offers a conceptualization of racial attitude development involving eight overlapping steps through which children progress during the first 10 years of life.

The primary strategy for gathering information was use of questionnaires administered to teachers, principals, and a stratified random sample of parents. Results are reported in terms of seven topics: the initial adjustment and orientation of kindergarten children; transition of children from kindergarten to first grade; transition of children from third to fourth grade; goals, objectives, and instructional practices in kindergarten and elementary classes; the involvement and role of parents in the four grade levels; the selection, assignment, preparation, experience, and development of kindergarten teachers; and the organization and  administration of kindergarten and primary school programs. Ten recommendations advise assessing needs of children for orientation programs, establishing more transition classes for the kindergarten to first grade group, shortening kindergarten days at the beginning of the school year, giving kindergarten teachers release time to visit preschool programs, stating kindergarten goals and objectives more specifically, reducing class size, increasing parent involvement in the schools, providing parent education courses, assigning only qualified teachers to kindergarten classes, and obtaining ideas from teachers concerning pertinent inservice programs. Questionnaires, tabular displays, and letters to parents, teachers, and principals are provided in the appendices. (Author/DB)",

These methods were (1) informal play, in which an adult named and described those objects with which a child played; (2) picture reading, in which an adult named and described objects depicted in photographs; and (3) a combination of the first and second methods. A fourth condition (control) was included to compare the amount of spontaneous learning which occurred. Fifteen children (mean age 20 months) enrolled in a day care center were individually pretested by either a classroom teacher or an assistant teacher in order to ensure an equal rate of familiarity/non-familiarity with items used for each condition. The pretest was followed by a 6-week experimental period, during which  the children were taught new object names under each of the above three conditions. At the end of the 6-week intervention period, children's familiarity with object names was tested again and their responses were compared with those of the pretest. Results indicated that very young children may learn to name objects more rapidly under the planned conditions of picture-reading and playing with the same objects. The importance of the picture-reading method for the development of young children's language and ways in which day care teachers can use this method are discussed. (Author/MP)",

        "description":"Preschool children's problem solving processes are investigated in both direct and indirect ways. Direct investigations focus on substantive and methodological issues related to how children solve a few well defined puzzles, such as the Tower of Hanoi and the Tangram. Indirect investigations deal with related issues: U-shaped (or non-monotone) developmental curves, rates of processing, structure-process invariance, and instructional theory. Findings indicate that by the time children reach kindergarten, they appear to have acquired without direct instruction variations on many of the components of mature problem solving strategies. Therefore, attempts to instruct children to be better problem solvers must first make a careful determination not only of the level of their  performances, but also of the strategies they use. A methodology involving the characterization of children's knowledge in terms of rules has been developed to facilitate such a determination. The position is taken that U-shaped curves always reflect an artifact of the assessment procedure, do not reflect any interesting underlying processes, and ultimately must be accounted for by general mechanisms of self-modification that are neither constrained nor informed by U-shaped phenomena. The focus on rates, processes, and structures as potential sources of developmental differences maps the domain for further investigations of how children learn to solve problems. (Author/RH)",

Four basic categories of dissimulation of emotional experience are specified, and motives for the use of cultural and personal display rules and direct deception are posed. Research among first-, third-, and fifth-grade students reveals four categories of display rule use (trouble-avoiding, maintenance of self-esteem, qualifying factors of a relationship, and maintenance of norms), each category increasing with age. Children across all three age groups were able to cite instances in which they concealed their feelings and/or thought they had observed others do so. When age-inappropriate rewards were given  to students for evaluating the difficulty level of a workbook, first graders, especially boys, were the most negative, fifth graders, especially girls, were the most positive. The most prevalent behavior across all age groups was smiling slightly, followed by abruptly ceasing to smile altogether.

The present retesting of 12 of the original 14 normal, first-born male subjects, now 12 years old, shows that their differential vocal responsiveness (DVR) scores at 3 months of age are related significantly to performance on such linguistic-academic tests as the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) verbal scale, the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) Arithmetic and Reading subtests, and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), but are not related to performance on such non-verbal tests as the WISC-R  Performance scale. It is concluded that the social discrimination ability of the infant, that is, the perceptual-cognitive ability to respond with excitement to the mother and to withhold responsiveness to the stranger, is of predictive value for later verbal-cognitive functioning. In contrast, the subjects' performance on the Gesell, a test that measures early psychomotor skills, did not correlate with later verbal-cognitive and academic skills, but did correlate significantly with non-verbal cognitive skills.

Observations focused on the students' immediate responses, such as attention, performance on the assignment, and reported understanding of the task. Two working hypotheses are presented about the nature of the students' cognitive processing while doing these unsupervised assignments. (1) Many students attend more closely to content coverage than to content mastery, perhaps because of teachers' emphasis on procedural directions and lack of emphasis on content-related purposes of the assignments. (2) Emphasis on content coverage in combination with difficult assignments may create a condition in which low achievers develop  strategies to complete work without developing strategies that help them make sense of their work. Further data analysis is being conducted to test these two hypotheses. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"In addition to problems of instrument selection and interpretation and problems associated with sampling procedures, psychologists' person-blame interpretations of social problems (interpretations that call for change in individuals and ignore needs for systemic change) and gender beliefs (such as assumptions about women and motherhood, men and power) present obstacles to meaningful research on parenting. These obstacles are specific instances of the general problems of the influence of assumptions about reality on scientific inquiry and bias in the conduct of research. Future parenting research should employ the Parental Role Scales (PRS), an instrument focusing on parental role perceptions in dual-working families and on the way perceived parental role demands are met in these  families. The PRS can be used to study situational, personal, and attitudinal parenting variables, as well as to explore the influence of social changes on parents' enactment of roles and to assess theories which predict differential enactment of roles for mothers and fathers.

        "description":"This report from the Comptroller General to the United States Congress finds Head Start to be an effective program whose fund distribution formula needs revision and whose management controls need improvement. Head Start's funding for enrollment and operating costs increased significantly between 1977-81. However, these funding increases were not matched by sustained nationwide efforts to increase enrollments and maintain high program quality. Program quality is considered threatened by a trend among grantees to reduce services. It is recommended that Congress revise the method of distributing funds in order to assure that adequate funding increases are made available to grantees prior to the authorization to increase enrollments. Improvements needed in Head Start's partially  completed system of management control are suggested; included is discussion of possible changes in planning, the management information system, program monitoring and federal staffing, and administrative support. Appendices record grantees and regional offices of the Department of Health and Human Services visited by the General Accounting Office, detail estimated unmet needs by States, and estimated average cost per child in Head Start full year and parent and child centers, indicate distribution of annual Head Start appropriations, and list data collection instruments and previous General Accounting Office reports on Head Start.

Effects of the training were measured primarily in terms of academic outcomes for underachievers; outcomes for normal and overachieving students were also examined. In addition to a focus upon achievement, the study was also designed to examine effects of teacher influence on school anxiety and classroom trust. Pupils' levels of academic achievement were identified (1) by calculating percentile ranks for intelligence and scholastic performance and (2) by grouping as under- and overachievers those students whose two percentile ranks significantly differed. Teachers were trained to provide more positive feedback, to understand the needs of underachievers, and to involve  more students in classroom discussion. Actual classroom demonstration lessons enabled the teachers to observe the training concepts in operation. Analysis of variance and t-tests were used to test the efficacy of training. Results indicated that training led teachers to increase positive feedback with students and decrease negative feedback. Academic achievement improved for all but the overachievers, classroom trust increased, and school anxiety decreased. (Author/DB)",

Theories of importance of self-concept as a determinant of achievement, particularly with minority/bilingual students, are briefly covered. Research findings are presented on whether self-concept improvements lead to improved achievement (result: self-concept and achievement appear so interdependent that precise relationships are difficult to distinguish) and whether bilingual programs enhance self-concept of Mexican Americans, as well as whether Mexican American students need to have their self-concepts enhanced (results:  effects of bilingual programs in improving self-concept have been mixed; Mexican Americans do not have poor self-concept). Problems contributing to the mixed results are listed: lack of agreement on appropriate measures of student affect; varying definitions and measures of self-concept; differing definitions of bilingual education and lack of equivalence between bilingual programs being compared; researchers' attempts to prove qualitative affective changes by using data from short-term quantitative studies; and schools' use of a meritocracy ideology to validate maintenance of social inequality. Potential solutions are given: rediscovery of the validity and importance of qualitative research, and redirection of evaluation by recognizing differing cognitive styles. (MH)",

For a comparative analysis of innovative methods in teaching multiple classes and disadvantaged groups, the following aspects were considered: rationale for organization of multi-grade/multiple classes; forms and types of multiple classes and disadvantaged groups; innovative projects/programmes; policies and linkages in the implementation of such programmes and projects; and the relationship between multiple classes and the disadvantaged groups as perceived by participants.

While nonmetro Hispanic school enrollments for ages 3-15 compared favorably with other groups in 1978, 36% of nonmetro Hispanic 16-24 year-olds were school dropouts, more than twice as many as nonmetro Whites. In 1977, 15% of Hispanic farmworkers 25 and older had more than an elementary education, compared with 74% of White farmworkers; income for nonmetro Hispanic men averaged $3,000 less than for nonmetro White men; the corresponding deficit for women was $1,245. In 1976, of five Southwestern states where most nonmetro Hispanics live, only  California had more than 50% of limited- and non-English speaking students enrolled in special language programs. In 1979, relatively few nonmetro Hispanic men (5.2%) and women (3.8%) had graduated from 4-year colleges; fewer nonmetro Hispanic males (19.4%) and females (40.4%, many of whom held clerical positions) held white-collar jobs than nonmetro White males (33.1%) and females (54.9%); unemployment rates for nonmetro Hispanics approached 10%. Heavy migration of Hispanics with little schooling from cities to nonmetro areas during 1975-1979 may partially account for differences in educational attainment of metro/nonmetro residents.

The training technique used 4 self-instructional modules containing 40 critical casework incidents (derived from discussions with 180 San Antonio, Texas, barrio residents) depicting misunderstanding between Mexican American clients and Anglo American child welfare workers due to differences in their sociocultural backgrounds. Trainees (27 non-Hispanic child welfare workers) were instructed to rank the 4 alternative explanations for the misunderstanding in each vignette according to the-best-to-the-least preferred  answer. Trainees were given the teaching volumes, each with a test form and rationales, in sequence. After reading the rationales in order of their answer selection, trainees scored their own tests. Results from trainees and 3 control groups (46 child welfare and family service workers tested with single volumes) indicated that significant cumulative learning took place, the technique was equally effective with experienced and inexperienced workers and for those with extensive exposure to the Mexican American community, and the best results were obtained when the modules were followed by discussions designed to integrate the knowledge gained.

Of the 3.1 million persons and 2.6 million families receiving some farm self-employment income in 1975, a larger proportion lived in nonmetropolitan (74%) than metropolitan areas and in the combined North and West (61%) than the South. Compared with the general population, recipients were more likely to be white, male, and older. Their families were more likely to be the husband-wife type, but less likely to have a family member under 18 years of age. In 1976 the median number of school years attended by farm income recipients was 12 years, close to the  national median of 12.3. Only about 15% of all farm income people had total income derived from farming. Median total personal income for persons with some farm self-employment income in 1975 was $8,219. Median income increased to $11,136 for those with additional nonfarm wage income. As the majority of farm income recipients also had income from additional sources (wages, investments, social security, retirement, welfare), little relationship existed between the level of farm income and total income.

        "description":"Focusing on how local village communities in developing countries might support part or all of their educational costs, this study describes methods used by developing countries to reduce education costs and offers a model incorporating several of the most successful components of such projects. First is a discussion of methods used by governments to reduce education costs, including salary freezes, lotteries, and patriotic service alternatives. A description of methods designed to provide local support of education examines community projects which incorporate traditionally-used techniques into the formal school, maximize use of school facilities and personnel, and introduce technology such as radio. A comprehensive model based on the more successful community projects, is  offered with a list of appropriate social criteria whose presence is necessary: a traditional structure of communal self-help; presence of a convincing/charismatic leader; outside intervention such as capital loan funds, technical assistance and training. The model includes communal construction of educational facilities, external loan funds, home tutors and instructional supervisors, support by radio-based instructional materials, commitments to specific income-generating tasks by students and parents for school support, community project management and training, and technical assistance from national sources. Appendices contain project case studies and summaries and other related information. (CM)",

Two questions were addressed: (1) the relationship between farming plans and attainment of a farm job; and (2) background factors and social conditions associated with the temporal sequencing of farm plans, the attainment of a farm job, or the decision to abandon a farm career and pursue other options. Results showed that  farming plans expressed by high school seniors on social surveys were poor predictors of attaining a farm job; most individuals working in farm jobs four years after high school did not report farming plans in high school; and formation of farming plans and/or attainment of a farm job were related to previous exposure to agriculture at home and in school. Data reaffirmed that unless a young person is from a farm background, he/she has little chance of becoming a farmer. (Author/CM)",

Whites constituted 94.4%, Blacks 4%, and persons of Spanish origin 1.9% of all farm residents. The farm population, with a median age of 35.5 years, had a lower proportion of young adults (20-34 years) and a higher proportion of persons 35-64 years old and elderly persons than the nonfarm population. The fertility of farm women continued to be higher than that of nonfarm women. About 45% of the farm population lived in  the North Central Region. Of all farm residents 14 years old and over, 64% were in the labor force or were seeking work. Only 47% of the average 3,500,000 persons employed in agriculture lived on farms. About three-fifths of the 1,700,000 farm residents employed in agriculture were self-employed. Median income of farm families was $16,357 in 1979, substantially lower than the $19,754 for nonfarm families. (NEC)",

        "description":"Data from the 1976 Survey of Income and Education (SIE) were used to assess the role of language factors in the occupational and income attainment process of Hispanic men and women aged 25-64 in 1976. The SIE contained a relatively complete set of basic language-use questions designed to ascertain the mother tongue of adults, the usual language spoken by an individual, and the presence of a second language spoken with regularity. Data indicated that Hispanic men who did not speak English were more concentrated in part-time employment than other men, while women who spoke English poorly were under-represented in both part-time and full-time employment. Both sexes were further penalized by their inability to speak English after they were employed. Data did not indicate that having  English as mother tongue was associated with either net higher occupational or income gains. Unlike Black men, Hispanic men appeared to have occupational and income attainments consonant with their background and educational characteristics. No important differences were found in the relative attainments of Black, White, and Hispanic women with respect to earnings. Findings suggested that the major problems faced by Hispanics were low educational attainment and inability of recent immigrants to speak English well. (Author/CM)",

Concerned with elementary and secondary education, Chapter 2 covers such topics as enrollment rates, characteristics of high school students, and school noncompletion. This chapter concludes with a brief  description of education in Puerto Rico. Covering postsecondary education, Chapter 3 includes tabular data on such topics as enrollment, degrees awarded, and student characteristics. Portraying the social status in American society of Hispanic teenagers and adults as related to their previous educational level, Chapter 4 covers such topics as employment by broad occupational category, unemployment rates, post-high school experiences, and income levels. Throughout the report, data on Hispanics are compared with data on Anglo Americans to provide an interpretative context. (Author/NQA)",

Research literature on policy-relevance of services ratings, monitoring service quality, ambiguity of satisfaction measures, spending preference as a policy-relevant variable, and differing attitudes of community leaders and nonleaders was reviewed. Data were collected by a mail questionnaire survey of selected county leaders (522 respondents) and by interviewing a random cross-sectional sample of 926 residents. Satisfaction scores and spending preferences  were obtained for seven community services (water, public schools, ambulance, garbage, hospitals, fire protection, law enforcement). Leaders tended to be more satisfied with services, except for schools, where residents were more satisfied. Residents were less constrained in spending preferences: a majority wanted to spend more on four services (water, schools, hospitals, fire protection), while a majority of leaders wanted to spend more on three services (water, public schools, fire protection). These results illustrate fundamental differences in perspective between leaders and nonleaders: residents may evaluate and express preferences based on their experience, whereas leaders may take a broader, community-wide perspective.

Funding formulas based on concentrations of targeted pupils and average cost per pupil appear to deprive small and rural local education agencies (LEA) of a fair share of Federal education monies. Selection criteria such as density and Education Division General Administrative Regulations (plan of operation, quality of key personnel, time-committed-to-the-job, budget-and-cost-effectiveness, evaluation) penalize small and rural LEAs. Other regulatory and administrative practices that complicate, impede, and discourage small and rural LEA participation in Federal education programs are maintenance-of-effort provisions; matching requirements; paperwork burdens; a propensity to favor large  over small grants; and difficulties in obtaining technical assistance and information about Federal programs. Suggestions for a rural initiative include: analysis of formula and criterion effects on rural and small LEAs, rural &quot;set-asides,&quot; direct rural communication, paperwork burden reduction, technical assistance participation, improving the data base, identifying and validating successful rural practices, and legislation to compensate for extra costs necessary to assure quality education for rural children.

The first section describes who potential dropouts are and why they are disadvantaged; how they can be identified; some remedial projects already undertaken; and some social impacts of dropping out of school. The second section reviews alternative educational strategies that have been tried, discussing relative advantages of integrated settings, segregated settings, and related and mediating variables (including teachers, resource rooms, individualized instruction, technological enhancement, counseling, facilities, programs, resources, and evaluation) that can affect the success of  segregated or integrated classrooms. The third section draws conclusions from the literature: (1) disadvantages of potential dropouts stem from poor self-image, pessimism, and lack of sense of purpose or positive motivation; (2) disadvantaged students are readily identifiable: are over-age for their grade, believe they are failures, feel rejected and alienated, miss much school because of illness, are behind in basic subjects, and are marking time and waiting to drop out; (3) integrating such students into the regular classroom is preferred, which requires superior teachers, new and meaningful programs, individualized instruction, and new strategies for enhancing self-image.

The framework is developed and used to describe the acquisition of understanding. A classroom experience using the ideas developed in a seminar with six Massachusetts Institute of Technology freshmen is reviewed. The document concludes with a review of five ingredients seen as part of the process of understanding mathematics. (MP)",

A theory of orbits is developed for the inverse-square central force law which differs considerably from the usual deductive approach. This document begins with qualitative aspects of solutions, and leads to a number of geometrically realizable physical invariants of the orbits. Consequently, most of the theorems rely only on simple geometrical relationships. Despite its simplicity, this planetary geometry is powerful enough to treat a wide range of perturbations with relative ease. It is felt that this treatment provides a better view of &quot;what doing physics is really like&quot; than the standard route via algebraic manipulations. The document  concludes with suggestions for further research into the geometry of planetary orbits. (MP)",

The training sessions were designed to represent a synthesis of ideas concerning the mechanisms of development put forth by Piaget, Ausubel, Bruner, and C. Lawson. The training was successful (p &lt; .001) and specific transfer of the trained concept was obtained for both samples. Pretest level of intellectual development was significantly related to success on posttest tasks of specific transfer (p &lt; .10). On one posttest task designed to measure nonspecific transfer, the trained seventh-grade  subjects scored significantly higher (p &lt; .05) than the control subjects. The effectiveness of the training suggests that properly designed instruction, which is based on students' intuitive conceptual understanding at the concrete level, can raise this intuitive understanding to the level of a meaningful verbal rule which then can be successfully applied in a variety of problem situations.

Based upon a neo-Piagetian theory of intellectual development proposed by Pascual-Leone (1969), two hypotheses were tested: (1) A significant relation should exist between a child's M-space and his/her ability to conserve; (2) Children should not conserve when the number of &quot;figurative schemes&quot; required to solve the task exceeds their M-space. Significant correlations were found among M-space and number, substance, and continuous quantity tasks. As predicted, none of 11 children with M-spaces of e + 1 demonstrated conservation. Contrary to theoretical predictions, a substantial number of  children with M-spaces of e + 2 conserved all four quantities. It is argued that it may be possible to retain the idea of M-space as a constraint on reasoning ability if theoretical statements regarding the number of required figurative schemes are modified.

The purpose of this research was to determine: (1) if conservation tasks, such as conservation of number, liquid amount, weight and volume, are unifactor; and (2) if conservation tasks form a scale of early concrete to early formal reasoning ability, would analysis yield two principal components - a concrete component and a formal component. Ten Piagetian tasks were administered to 96 seventh-grade urban science students. The factor structure of the tasks was determined using principal components analysis. The analysis did reveal two components. One component was identified as an early concrete operational component. The other component  was identified as an early formal operational component. The results were consistent with Piaget's theoretical discussions about what the tasks measure and represent a factorial validation of the tasks. This indicates that the tasks can be used in a meaningful manner to measure concrete and formal operational thought. (Author/DC)",

An example, using actual data from a two-year college in California, is worked through in detail. A simple, graphical method of solution is presented to avoid the use of any sophisticated mathematics. The results of applying this analysis to 70 two-year colleges is used to establish the average performance characteristics of these institutions. An individual campus can then analyze its own  data and compare its energy usage with that of its peers.

The research was conducted at a major West Coast state university located in an urban metropolitan area. Data were gathered through a questionnaire mailed to a sample of 200 Japanese Americans and 200 White full-time undergraduates randomly selected from institutional records. Eighty percent of the Japanese American and 84% of the Whites returned questionnaires. Results indicated that the processes related to educational ambition and, therefore, eventual status attainment are different for Japanese Americans than for Whites. Forty one percent of the Japanese American respondents expected to obtain up to four years of college education, 33% expected to  work toward a master's degree, and 26% expected to do work toward a doctorate or professional degree. The comparable percentages for Whites were 50, 31, and 19. Level of academic performance along with the related variables of academic self-confidence and concern over the negative effects of inadequate grades have the highest coefficients for both Japanese Americans and Whites. However, the most important variable for the former is concern over inadequate grades while the most important for the latter is academic self-confidence. Parents' expectations, concern over the negative effects of insufficient motivation, and the importance of \"connections\" in determining educational achievement assumed an intermediate position of importance for Japanese Americans. None of these variables have the  same relative degree of importance for Whites. (Author/RM)",

The rising prices of materials, energy, and land ensure that buying, building, and maintaining even the most elementary shelter today costs several times what it did a decade ago. People in industrial countries must spend an even larger share of their income if they want to buy a home. Those who cannot afford to buy a house are finding a scarcity of rental units. There is mounting despair about shelter conditions in the Third World, as it becomes apparent that most people will never live in homes that reach the standard now found in industrial countries. A number of specific topics are examined. First, the difference between housing needs and housing demand is discussed. The need for housing is primarily a function of population  growth. Housing demand is the result of the impact of both population growth and economic variables. The changing housing stock (new units flowing in vs. old units flowing out) is then examined. Resources--type of land house stands on and materials, labor, financing, and energy that go into building a house--are the third topic treated. The fourth topic dealt with is the role land plays in the housing market. Other topics examined are old and new building materials, energy, financing, the home of the future, and housing policies in an era of limits. (Author/RM)",

The paper begins with a history of the confict between creationists and those who believe in evolution. The author explores the movement of evangelical fundamentalists who in the 1920s sought to dislodge evolution and in the 1980s seek equal time for creation science alongside evolution theory. Going back before Darwin to the early church, this dispute is long range over the origin, nature, and future of man, and the universe. It has often been expressed in clashes between religion and science, fundamentalism  and modernism, and now born again evangelism and secular humanism. Court cases are described. Creationist organizations and strategies are discussed. Resolutions and policy statements of various groups are included and arguments for and against evolution, scientific creation, and equal time are presented. The last part of the paper talks about what educators can do. School districts should anticipate and prepare early for problems likely to arise. A \"Procedures Committee\" charged with dealing with conflict situations should be organized. This committee should assemble, maintain, and make available a library of information on evolution/creation and gauge community feelings. Clear procedures to reduce conflict, such as having complaints written and signed, should be articulated.  (Author/RM)",

        "description":"This paper examines the following issue: Is the process of educational attainment the same for both whites and Mexican Americans, or does it differ? Two possible explanations for why mean differences exist in educational outcomes for whites and Mexican Americans are that either the process of educational attainment varies between the two groups, or if the process is invariant, one group starts with social advantages not shared by the other group. Data for the study were drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972. The basic model of educational attainment used in the analysis considers education to be a function of father's occupational status, father's education, mother's education, number of siblings, sex, ability, academic preparation, and  college plans. An examination of these variables indicates that there are more similarities between the two groups than there are differences. There are some differences, but it cannot be said that they consistently favor or disfavor either group. For example, for neither group is the effect of father's occupation statistically significant. For Mexican Americans the influence of father's education is nearly twice that exhibited among whites, but the influence of mother's education among Mexican Americans is negligible. The overall impression of the study is that the process of educational attainment may differ between the two groups, but not a degree worthy of much notice. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"This publication contains exerpts from interviews with international scholars in the natural and social sciences about the future of education. Part I discusses educating for a new millennium. The scholars suggest basic concepts in their fields of expertise that young persons should understand if they are to survive the troubled years that lie ahead. For example, one concept youth need to grasp is the increasing interdependence that exists among nations and people everywhere. Among the concepts that cut across all disciplines, the one most often mentioned or implied by social scientists was the need for students to develop a set of carefully examined values. This concern with moral development appeared to be worldwide. Part II discusses what kind of schooling, what kind of  lifelong education and what sort of learning experiences will be part of the future. A few examples follow. A multicultural tone must be incorporated into the curriculum. Helping children understand other cultural groups was one of the most important lessons to be extracted from the interviews conducted. The future curriculum will utilize teaching practices that involve genuine student participation in society's problems and processes. To enhance educational resources, the establishment of a Coordinated Educational Network is proposed. The future structure for schools must accommodate a seamless lifelong ability age curriculum that is based on the abilities and needs of individual learners rather than a lockstep graded school based on chronological age.

First, definitions are provided and discussed. The paper then goes on to examine multicultural and global education as emerging concepts in schools. Multicultural education appears in programs such as ethnic studies, intergroup studies, and bilingual and bicultural education. Global education often comes under the rubric of area studies or international relations. The curriculum models of James Banks which show how curriculum reform is contributing to the evolution of multicultural and global education in the schools are examined. The relationship between multicultural and global education can be  summarized by saying that although each can be represented by a different curriculum model, one develops quite naturally from the other and is compatible with it. The striking similarities between multicultural goals identified by Banks and those of global education proposed by the Global Perspectives Project are examined. Future action steps suggested include the following: (1) discuss with students the many ways in which cultural differences and global issues impinge on our lives; (2) develop a new course, such as environmental studies, and introduce it into the curriculum; and (3) devote an entire school day to a global or cultural theme.

        "description":"The central purpose of social studies education is the development of citizenship. In social studies education four elements are essential. The first element is knowledge. Social studies must draw heavily upon the social sciences, including history, and from related fields such as law, psychology, the humanities, journalism, and the arts. Young people must come to see that the ideas which make up the body of the scholarly fields change over the year. Knowledge must be balanced between understandings needed in young people's own immediate social worlds and society at large, and it must be intellectually honest. The second element is values. Identifying their own values must be a part of students' education in social studies. So also must be recognizing the values of others. The  third element is skills in acquiring information and thinking about social affairs. Young people need skills to make their knowledge and values active and so continue in the lifelong process of learning. The fourth element is social participation. Everyone lives as part of social groups, which influence and are influenced by their members. Without direction toward action, social studies education becomes passive. The paper concludes with a description of the characteristics of programs which must be implemented if these four elements are to be translated into actual learning opportunities. Included among these characteristics are that objectives must be clear, learning activities must be appropriate for objectives, varied instructional materials are needed, the classroom climate must be  supportive, and there must be assessment and evaluation.

Data used are drawn from the 15% 1970 Public Use Sample for noninstitutionalized individuals aged 55 and over from Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina. The paper focuses on some of the major dimensions of social differentiation within the aged population. The impact of race and rural/urban residence on a series of socioeconomic outcomes, including living conditions, position (past or current) in the labor force, and the levels and sources of economic support is investigated. Findings include the following. The Black aged in the South experience much worse living conditions than do the White aged within all residence categories. Living conditions  for both races improve substantially with movement from rural to urban to major metropolitan settings. For both sexes and for both racial categories, personal earnings, as well as personal income, increases from rural to urban to major metropolitan settings. In rural areas, the earnings and income levels of Black males are about half that of their White male counterparts; and these economic differences between Black and White males increases in the urban and major metropolitan areas. Regarding sources of income, the dependence on social security and railroad retirement remains fairly constant across residential categories for Blacks of both sexes, but declines for Whites from rural to urban to major metropolitan areas. In general, the aged in metropolitan areas depend more heavily on  earnings as a source of personal income than the aged in urban or in rural areas. (Author/RM)",

The following topics are discussed: the country and the people, the basic system, preschool education, primary education, secondary education, Maori and Island education, special education, tertiary education, teacher education, continuing education, educational organizations, and recent developments. Education in New Zealand begins with optional attendance at one of two types of preschool institutions: play centers and kindergartens. Primary schooling consists of eight years. There are five levels or grades of secondary education. Pupils must remain in school until the age of 15, which means that most pupils receive at least two years of secondary education. Tertiary educational institutions include technical institutes,  community colleges, teachers colleges, universities, and one university-level College of Agriculture. While all these types of institutions are considered &quot;tertiary&quot; from the administrative point of view, this term does not mean that a student must complete the full five years of secondary education in order to be admitted. For example, students may enroll in technical institutes and community colleges upon completing two years of secondary education. State run schools at primary and secondary levels are free. Partial financial assistance to private schools is provided by the state. Many study grants are provided to students for tertiary education. (Author/RM)",

A \"liberalizing effect\" is defined as shifting students' world view and social analysis from an exceptionalistic to an universalistic perspective. The two professors involved in the study intended to liberalize attitudes through their courses by assigning readings which utilize a radical perspective and lecturing primarily from materials with a radical perspective. A questionnaire on political and social attitudes was administered to 103 students in four classes at a medium sized, state-supported, liberal arts university. The questionnaire tapped several dimensions of liberalism/conservatism: status quo/change;  acceptance/criticism of societal arrangements; and whether individuals or society are to blame for social problems. Two sections of Social Problems (Sociology 250) and two sections of Human Growth and Development (Psychology 234) were used. Results showed that students are more liberal at the conclusion than at the beginning of the courses. The sociology students showed a greater liberal change than did the students in the psychology courses. The authors point out that we now need to examine whether these liberal values are still held at later times when the student may not be taking any sociology courses. (Author/RM)",

Sample questions designed to reveal student attitudes toward nutrition are presented for each age group with comments on the responses. Concepts such as food groups, obesity, and the relationship between appetite and hunger were troublesome for  the fourth graders and some eighth graders. By the eleventh grade, a definite improvement in the ability to identify the nutrient contribution of each food group was evident.

The types and levels of curriculum and instructional design skills taught in each program were examined. It was assumed that all of the teacher education programs had an objectives-based curriculum. Among the types of skills critical to curriculum design were goal analysis, content selection and analysis, and identification of terminal objectives. The skills associated with instructional design included identifying and sequencing enabling objectives, selecting optimal testing points, and preparing instructional materials and  events. Little consistency was found across the programs in the types or levels of skills included, or in the levels of required performance. It was found that less than one out of four competencies on the elementary school level, and less than one out of ten on the high school level, required teachers to have curriculum or instructional design skills. Of the total skills analyzed, instructional design skills represented 76 percent, and curriculum design 24 percent. It is recommended that a standard set of minimum competencies in instructional and curriculum design be developed and implemented and that a standard format and specific guidelines for self studies be developed for use by teacher education institutions in Pennsylvania.

This program was created after a self-study of a local school and the surrounding community indicated that school community cooperation, student motivation, student performance, and discipline policies could be improved. The two-year academic program was designed to provide experiences and activities through three major avenues: (1) core courses in such areas as multicultural education and classroom management; (2) seminars or independent study geared to individual needs; and (3) action research projects conducted around an individual's chosen area of  specialization. The core courses were completed during the first year, after which participants identified specific areas of community, school, classroom, and personal needs to be studied. University advisors provided group instruction and assistance in action research skills. A research seminar was held during the first year to refine the participants' organization and strategy skills through group discussion. Forty completed projects were presented by the researchers at a colloquium, an event that will occur annually in an effort to motivate and institutionalize classroom research. (FG)",

Questionnaires were sent to school principals, physical educators, and special educators in 1,076 elementary, junior, and senior high schools. The survey revealed that the educable mentally retarded, learning disabled, and trainable mentally retarded account for most of the handicapped students participating in regular physical education. While school personnel feel that physical education is important for the well-being of the handicapped, appropriate physical education is not provided. Although most handicapped students participate in physical education, few have access to special physical education classes or an adapted physical  education specialist. Facilities, equipment, and the size and training of the staff restrict the establishment of appropriate physical education for the handicapped. Most teachers but less than half of the principals believe funds should be increased to improve services for the handicapped. Few principals give a high priority to hiring an adapted physical education specialist. (Author/JD)",

The first evolved from research developed at the Research and Development Center for Teacher Education at the University of Texas at Austin, and is based on a formulation of stages teachers pass through as they gain teaching experience. Identified as &quot;stages of concern&quot;, this approach focuses upon the teacher's progress from concern for survival, through mastery of teaching tasks, to concern about their impact on pupils' learning. The second approach, based on theories of cognitive development resulting from research at the University of Minnesota, advocates emphasizing adult development and maturity as one key to increased teacher effectiveness. Higher stages of development are  seen as involving greater complexity and differentiation of function enabling the individual to cope with a greater variety of situations in teaching. The third approach, known as &quot;a developmental style of inservice&quot;, is largely the work of practitioners. Teachers' centers offer a contemporary expression of this orientation. For each approach an analysis of recommended goals and strategies is offered, and a critique of its justification is presented. (JD)",

Three developmental practices embody potentially harmful inclinations: (1) the tendency to adopt the end state of a developmental theory (such as Kohlberg's) as an educational goal, thereby imposing a restrictive model of learning on culturally diverse students; (2) a too literal commitment to readiness as a basis for deciding when to teach certain topics, denying some students opportunities that are given to others who are deemed more advanced; and (3) an overemphasis on student choice and self-directed learning, with the consequent abnegation of teacher responsibility for student learning. Prospective teachers who are taught to use the developmental approaches may uncritically  apply them in situations where students' cultural background, race, or sex should suggest independent planning and decision-making. Advocates of the developmental approach have the responsibility to warn teachers and teacher educators of the pitfalls in applying developmental theories. (FG)",

An underlying principle in all of the statements is that physical education is an integral part of the total educational program. To become a fully functioning individual, the child needs many opportunities to participate in well-conceived and well-taught learning experiences in physical education. Brief positions are offered on the following topics: (1) the child; (2) the teacher; (3) teacher preparation and staff development; (4) instructional programs; (5) evaluation; (6) organization and administration; (7) equipment and facilities; and (8) school-related programs.

Its goals are to address the needs of limited- and non-English speaking students in bilingual classrooms by preparing teachers, teacher trainers, curriculum specialists, researchers, evaluators, and administrators to serve in the development and implementation of bilingual programs. Prerequisites for the program include bilingual proficiency in English and any other minority language spoken in Connecticut, and experience teaching or providing services to programs with bilingual or bicultural clientele. The programs are composed of the following units: (1) a core section of eight courses in  bilingual-bicultural education; (2) socio-cultural foundations of education; (3) training in language and linguistics; (4) research methodology, field experiences, and dissertation for doctoral candidates; and (5) two chosen areas of specialization as minors. Competency categories were developed, including emphasis on pedagogy, teacher preparation and supervisory skills, linguistic ability, cultural knowledge, parent and community involvement, evaluation and testing, and research. Among the ongoing and future projects of the department are a recruitment and dissemination plan, research on hierarchies of needs in bilingual education, and establishment of an annual conference at the University.

How are legal case histories used to establish precedent and to assist in the application of legal principles to specific cases? These and other questions are addressed in this examination of the potential of using a basic case structure in educational evaluation similar to that used in American law. Evaluation case histories might be valuable as examples of how to do evaluations, as precedents, or as a means to accumulate knowledge and experience about evaluation. The differences between an evaluation report and an evaluation case history are outlined: an evaluation case history would be shorter, more accessible, written for the practicing evaluator, and would provide explanation and justification for the  evaluator's action. An evaluation case history should include the procedural history, the facts of the case, the issues, the conceptual principles, and the decision. (Author/BW)",

To provide a context for the discussion, the Head Start Strategy for Spanish Speaking Children and the plans for the evaluation of its curriculum development component are described. An outline of the purpose and the design of the evaluation project follows. This involves not only the administration of tests to measure the impact of program objectives, but the collection of data to illustrate the  nature and extent of program implementation over time, which can then be used to determine the feasibility of implementing the curriculum models at other sites; and collection of qualitative observation and change data over time for use as outcome data. The reproductive function this evaluation is likely to serve is then exemplified by drawing attention to how evaluative research can be used to legitimate social action programs. Future directions are also discussed. (Author/AEF)",

The population target is youth from preschool to post-college graduate ages. The study is divided into three major sections: (1) a discussion of the trends which have emerged over time that have been supported by creditable data. The discussion approaches the subject by first reviewing aptitude test score patterns from 1952 through 1980 on eight scholastic aptitude and admission tests. Examinees for these tests predominantly ranged from 11th grade through graduate levels. Second, an analysis is done on the scholastic achievement test score data covering 10 different test batteries for grades 1 through 12. Finally, section  one of the paper concludes with a brief overview of other indicators of significant, though less quantifiable changes in the target population during the period; (2) an annotated bibliography of 49 sources which were reviewed by the author, including 34 citations which have been quoted directly from other sources; and (3) a relatively complete bibliography of literature related to the decline of test scores.

Meta-analysis differs from traditional narrative forms of research reviewing in that it is more quantitative and statistical. Thus, the methods of meta-analysis are merely statistical methods, suitably adapted in many instances, that are applicable to the job of integrating findings from many studies. A meta-analysis involves about a half-dozen steps: (1) defining the problem, (2) finding the research studies, (3) coding the study characteristics. The thinking and research reported here is recorded in roughly the same order. The report encompasses general background on the approach, and the results of some original research on  approach taken in a meta-analysis, numerous illustrations of the approach, and the results of some original research on characteristics, (4) measuring the study findings on a common scale, and (5) analyzing the aggregation of findings and their relationship to the characteristics. The thinking can be read in at least three ways: as a textbook of methods of integrative analysis, as a record of some new ideas about integrative analysis, or as an apologia for meta-analysis.

Eighty-eight college students were classified into four grade categories using achievement test results obtained from tailored testing procedures based on maximum information item selection and maximum likelihood ability estimation. Tests were terminated using the SPRT procedure. The results of the study showed that the three-parameter logistic based procedure had higher decision consistency than the one-parameter based procedure when classifications were repeated after one week. Both procedures required fewer items for classification into grade  categories than a traditional test over the same material. The three-parameter procedure required the fewest items of all, using an average of 12 to 13 items to assign a grade. (Author)",

        "description":"This study has three purposes: (1) to determine whether the graphic organizer (a schematic representation of text structure using key vocabulary terms) could be used to compensate for the effects of a passage organized with a description top-level structure; (2) to explore the effectiveness of providing students differing in reading ability with different types of instructional strategies and text structures; (3) to learn how graphic organizers, text structure, and reading comprehension level affect posttreatment attitudes. Tenth graders read two versions of an expository passage which contained identical information but differed in top-level structures (description versus comparison/contrast). Students were either exposed to or denied instruction with a graphic organizer that  had been constructed to reflect the top-level structure of the comparison/contrast passage. Multiple regression analyses revealed these findings: first, immediate free recall performance was positively affected only under the description text condition; second, both skilled and unskilled readers appeared to benefit from the use of graphic organizers; third, text organized with a description top-level structure did not produce significantly better recall performance among poorer readers; and finally, multiple regression analyses of posttreatment attitude data did not yield any educationally significant results.

The first study in this report compares three order analysis procedures: Krus and Bart's (1974) procedure and Reynolds' (1976) procedures using two of Cliff's (1977) consistency indices. The comparisons were based on seven simulated data sets with known factorial dimensionality, and two multidimensional sets of mathematics data. The second Reynolds procedure reproduced the factor structure for the simulated data sets, but none of the procedures could reproduce the factors for the mathematics data. The second study in this report presents preliminary results using a new  order-analysis procedure which solves some of the difficulties with reproducing factorial dimensionality. (Author/BW)",

The present study augments previous research relevant to this concern by comparing the difficulty and reliability of multiple-choice and completion item formats as applied to the classroom measurement of quantitative skills. This investigation also includes two variations of the multiple-choice format designed to reduce cues provided by alternatives. Focus is placed on the external validity of the experiment by using an actual examination of course material administered to students in a realistic classroom setting. When plausible distractors are used, minimal effects on  difficulty and reliability are observed as a result of using &quot;none of the above&quot; or by using ranges of values for alternatives. The results of the study also support serious consideration of the math-completion format when efficiency of scoring is not a major concern. It is shown that fewer math-completion items are required for obtaining reliability equal to that provided by multiple-choice items. Implications which varying difficulties and reliabilities have on grading standards and test length are discussed. (Author/AL)",

The present study used two different approaches in an attempt to resolve inconsistencies found among articles regarding the use of incentives to increase mailed survey response rates. It was hypothesized that a uniform method of analysis for all articles might resolve the reported inconsistencies. This possibility was examined as Experiment I. In addition, it was hypothesized that pooling  data across studies by summing the number of returned and total number of survey questionnaires at each treatment level might also resolve the reported inconsistencies.

However, significant within-class relationships did form a pattern indicating that students who were not as successful academically as other students in the class with similar entering ability, tended to act differently in the classroom and were treated differently by the teacher. Several explanations were offered for this pattern of teacher-student interactions occurring within  classes. It was concluded that results obtained at one level of analysis cannot be generalized to other levels.

The purpose of this study was to determine if select objectively measured indirect indicators of writing ability do account for scores obtained on holistically scored direct measures of writing ability. The indirect measure was the Missouri College English Test, composed of 90 multiple-choice items assessing punctuation, capitalization, grammar, spelling, sentence style and structure, and paragraph organization. The direct measure was an essay on a  general topic, to be written in 30 minutes. Bivariate and multiple correlational analyses were conducted between each subtest of the Missouri test and the essay. All six independent measures together accounted for 26 percent of the variance in the essay scores. These results might make questionable the sole use of indirect measures for making decisions about competence in written English. (Author/BW)",

On average, both miles-per-gallon, and repair costs-per-mile favor premium gasoline by a slight margin. However, cost-per-mile significantly favors the use of regular gasoline with the net result that the total cost-per-mile is approximately one-half cent less for regular gasoline. Based on a bus fleet operation of 7,973,488 miles annually, the potential savings for MCPS by the use of regular gasoline are $39,070 or approximately 2.6 percent of the $1,475,200 budgeted in Fiscal Year 1979 for bus operation and  maintenance. Study results confirm the decision a year ago to convert the school bus fleet to regular gasoline. If the difference in cost between regular and premium gasoline continues to increase, the projected savings from that decision will also increase. Secondary study results suggest the need for continuing to monitor the scope of bus operations, to enable effective management decisions concerning this matter. (Author/KM)",

This magnet school, partially funded by the Emergency School Aid Act (ESAA), was designed to provide a desegregated experience for interested students in the areas of creative writing, drama, dance, art, and music (both instrumental and vocal). As a part of the evaluation of the school's program, a questionnaire was administered to students in grades nine, ten, and eleven in June 1979. The school will graduate its first senior class in June, 1980. Students' perceptions of the school program with respect to homework, availability of materials, performances and presentations, course content, school facilities, and racial attitudes were all explored in the fifteen item questionnaire. Students'  perceptions of the school were overwhelmingly positive. They reported success in both academic and performance areas. In response to the question: &quot;If you had it to do all over again, would you choose to attend The High School for the Creative and Performing Arts?&quot; a total of 88 percent responded &quot;Yes.&quot; Asked to rate the relationships among the various races at the school, over 93 percent rated them better than average or good.

Explored are the educational reform movements in urban centers between 1840 and 1920, especially the period separating the depression of 1893 and the Palmer Raids of World War I. Attention focuses on four cities: Rochester, New York; Toledo, Ohio; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and Kansas City, Missouri. A case study analysis of these four cities evaluates the influence of both well known and obscure educational reformers by using a diverse range of sources which include newspaper reports, records of voluntary associations, and petitions to local school boards. The analysis identifies different political traditions, ethnic mixes,  bureaucratic school arrangements, and industrial settings which contributed to the shape of new social service programs in different communities. The study attempts to discover the cause of the upsurge in interest in school reform at the turn of century, groups and community organizations that lobbied for change are identified. Also reviewed are attitudes of parents and children toward educational reform and how these changes affected their lives. (Author/APM)",

Tables show mean nutritional intake and the percent of calories from protein, carbohydrate and fat for elementary, junior high and senior high school levels. The tables reveal a general decrease in the nutritional quality of diets as students get older. In addition, it is shown that secondary level females had the poorest diets, with over 70 percent having iron intakes less than two thirds of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA). The paper points out that a substantial portion of the surveyed children showed less than two thirds of the FDA for intake of calcium, vitamin A, thiamin,  and vitamin C. It is also noted that the study indicated high intakes of sodium, cholesterol, and saturated fatty acids and relatively high caloric intakes from snacks and high sugar foods. (Author/APM)",

The report states that the program was designed to aid the educational and cultural development of Greek and Korean speaking limited English pupils in grades K-6. Program objectives are listed as achievement gains in students' English speech and comprehension, native language proficiency, social studies, science, and mathematics performance, and increased student participation in classroom activities and extracurricular activities. Pretest and posttest scores show that the first three objectives were met and teachers' ratings reveal increased student involvement. Notes from several classroom observations are provided and teacher training, parent activities, and the Parents  Advisory Committee are discussed. (APM)",

The scale was administered to these students and three control groups which included general underclassmen, non-education major seniors, and education major seniors. The scores of these groups were compared among the groups and also with a 1956 survey by Emory Bogardus. A high degree of agreement was found between the student samples and the Bogardus sample. Among the student samples two patterns emerged. First, mean scores declined between a sample of one underclassmen and one of non-education major seniors.  Second, mean scores declined between the underclassmen sample and the human relations pretest sample, declined further between the human relations pretest and human relations posttest, but then increased between the human relations posttest and the senior education major sample. A high degree of agreement was found among the scores of all of the student samples. An analysis of variance of the means for the racial and ethnic groups included in the scale suggested that the human relations program does produce measurably lower social distances among its students.

Collaborative programs are defined as involving one or more of the following non-school agencies: business, industry, labor, institutions of higher education, community groups, local government, and service agencies. Each case study attempts to examine the costs associated with projects, determine the impact of collaborative programs on students in both academic and occupational domains, and describe the educational  processes and characteristics necessary for success. Case studies also identify those school and business practices which best facilitate student transition from school to the labor market.

The acquisition of reading and language skills was examined from several perspectives which included community involvement, parent teacher relations, instructional techniques, and administrative effect. It was intended  that the results of these inquiries would be provided to school personnel and regarded as contributions in a mutual research effort. This reciprocal relationship between researchers and school personnel was evaluated and suggestions were made to improve the efficacy of their interaction. (APM)",

Section one argues that there is a need to shift the educational policy focus from frequency rates to the conditions of opportunity. In the second section, three theories of distribution of opportunities are addressed. Papers included analyze the structure of the political arguments for equal educational opportunity, the efficiency origins of social equity issues, and a theory of equal educational opportunity based on human diversity with social justice. Section three treats the practical concerns involved in achieving educational equity. Questions examined in the context of state policy at all levels of education include what  constitutes the availability of opportunity, sufficient opportunity, and appropriate opportunity. The final section discusses theories of inequity and explores the fundamental causes of inequities within the educational system. The first paper in the last section analyzes educational inequities from the perspective of class conflict theory, while the second paper asserts that the primary sources of inequity rest within the male/female perspectives generated within the family structure.

The results showed that black students were less successful than whites in prompt and in subsequent four year college completion. Also, males were far less successful than females in completing college on schedule. Initial race and sex differences favoring whites and females remained when examining subsequent college graduation rates. Regarding variable effects, college grade performance was found to be a major determinant of prompt and subsequent college completion for all race and sex groups. In addition, high school rank was  an important determinant of prompt graduation for white males and prompt and subsequent graduation for black females. With reference to college characteristics, private colleges had a significant effect on prompt graduation for white and black males but no significant effect for females. However, attending a selective college did not have a significant effect on prompt or subsequent graduation for any of the four race and sex groups studied. (Author/APM)",

The Inservice Training Component was evaluated using the results of four annual surveys of school staff at all levels and of middle and high school students conducted in 1977, 1978, 1979, and 1980. Findings indicated that progress was made toward most of the six objectives of the component which included: (1) student racial relations; (2) relations between instructional staff and students; (3) racial relations among staff  members; (4) teacher treatment of black and white students; (5) knowledge of racial-ethnic groups; and (6) ability to prevent disruptive classroom behavior and resolve conflicts.

Materials and assistance were also offered to a parochial school. A total of six product objectives related to student outcomes and two process objectives related to instructional variables were identified as the goals of the program. Evaluation procedures indicated that two of the product objectives and both process objectives were achieved. Relevant data and instruments are appended. (MK)",

Its early beginnings came in 1970 with &quot;Part I&quot; Program funding. In 1971 funding of several projects gave impetus to development of career education, and a Curriculum Management Center was established in the Bureau of Adult Vocational and Technical Education. Thirteen problems in curriculum and management were identified as bases for the curriculum development program. From them were developed four primary purposes for establishment of a National Network for Curriculum Coordination: information sharing, standards, curriculum needs as a basis for  planning, and coordination. Recently, an opinion survey of State Directors of Vocational Education and State Directors of Community and Junior Colleges was made concerning NNCCVTE. (Responses are detailed for five questions: use and frequency of use of NNCCVTE, reasons for not using its services, whether funds diverted by NNCCVTE could be used to better advantage and how, suggestions to encourage extensive use of NNCCVTE, and changes in NNCCVTE to better serve needs of vocational and technical education. Fifteen recommendations for mobilizing support of key persons are listed.) (YLB)",

Involvement of multiple agencies gives rise to networking. Disseminating is also a major facet of planned change, one stage of which is acquisition--a concern of the National Network for Curriculum Coordination in Vocational and Technical Education (NNCCVTE). The concept of utilization demands that both product and process impact assessment be considered. Nine major problems hinder the acquisition of sound impact data: problems in aggregating data, the myth of theory, inaccurate or incomplete specification of an instructional model, error of  measurement, inappropriateness of certain models, neglect of the dissemination component by instructional materials developers, by neglect of the communication systems model, variations in source credibility, and improper funding for dissemination activities. NNCCVTE dissemination personnel concerned with impact assessment must focus on these questions: Are minimal conditions present for impact to occur?, What factors are important in determination of program consequence?, Are followup studies important?, What is the place of experimental designs?, What are major purposes of impact assessment?, and What facts influence impact data in program planning based on manpower data?

Royce Bland, in &quot;Suggested Techniques for Handling Discipline Problems,&quot; suggests that appropriate motivational techniques and respect for the student help alleviate discipline problems. In &quot;Self-Esteem--An Alternative to Substance Abuse&quot; Yvette P. Bogan chronicles behavior of a young female drug abuser as she develops a more positive self-image. She postulates that drug abuse is the result of a poor self-image. In &quot;Working with Handicapped Students Who are Disadvantaged&quot; Arlington Chisman  reviews some exercises that may be useful to teachers of handicapped students. Robert B. Pyle, in &quot;Performance-Based Individualized Instruction to Motivate Special Needs Students,&quot; offers practical advice for establishing a performance-based program. Frederick G. Welch suggests six effective techniques for teachers to motivate disadvantaged students (&quot;Motivating the Disadvantaged Youth&quot;). &quot;Contemporary Legal Issues and How They Impact upon the Educator,&quot; by David G.

This will require program improvement for training and retraining in new high-technology occupations, access to programs by disadvantaged and other persons who need skill training to qualify for unsubsidized jobs, and collaborative ventures among vocational education, other education and training programs, and the private sector. Reauthorization of the Vocational Education Act should concentrate on six areas: (1) areas of high unemployment; (2) emerging occupations in high demand areas; (3) economic development and training; (4) handicapped; (5) defense needs; and  (6) correctional education. National and state occupational information coordinating committees and the National Center for Research in Vocational Education should be continued. It is also recommended that more flexibility in funding and regulations be established; that fund distribution should combat past inequities; that incentive funds should encourage innovative linkages between vocational education and other education and training programs; that sex equity should receive continuing emphasis; and that national, state, and local advisory councils should be mandated and their independence strengthened.

        "description":"A shrinkage of one-half or more in available federal funds designated for human services is expected to occur in the next five years. Despite this outlook, federal funds are available for increases in human services, provided that such services are organized into related systems of services and are planned and managed as such. This essay on budgeting in human services, using fiscal incentives to restructure programs and operations, can be of use to program planners and financial and budget people. \"Designed in\" cost control is the chief end of the measures described. The essay first indicates how disincentives to reform result from current budgeting and programming practices, and then shows how reform can be advanced and, in time, achieved through the combined use of two  approaches: maximizing of federal funding, which provides funds for \"buying reform\" in the states; and program restructuring, in which the program is constructed on systems-oriented lines as a continuum of care. The two approaches accommodate both program preferences (such as normalization) and fiscal preferences (such as long-term minimum total cost for operating a normalized system). The purpose of the essay, however, is program reform in the states, not the maximizing of federal funds. To this end, maximizing is only a means, a set of techniques that the states can use to achieve parity with the federal government in program funding. (KC)",

        "description":"The equal employment opportunity policies of the Reagan administration may be summarized in the following manner: while the administration will not retreat from the historic commitment to enforce federal civil rights laws, it will no longer insist upon, or in any way support, the use of quotas or any numerical or statistical formula designed to provide to nonvictims of discrimination preferential treatment based on race, sex, national origin, or religion. This policy has been adopted for several reasons: (1) Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which mandates nondiscriminatory employment decisions, does not countenance racial quotas; (2) the economic and social strides gained by minorities in the 1960s demonstrated the capacity of minorities to compete effectively in a  nondiscriminatory environment; and (3) there is no moral countenance for quotas. The number and nature of suits brought by the Justice Department to enforce equal employment opportunity legislation will not change significantly. In addition to seeking full redress for individual victims, the Department will continue to seek injunctive relief directing employers to make future nondiscriminatory employment decisions, and, where appropriate, will also seek percentage recruitment goals for monitoring purposes.

        "description":"The Navy is finding it increasingly difficult to attract personnel with aptitude scores high enough to make them eligible for entry into Class &quot;A&quot; technical schools. Training courses were developed for low aptitude students that would increase their mastery of the prerequisite skills and knowledge (S/Ks) they would need for success in selected Class &quot;A&quot; schools. Four training areas were selected: propulsion engineering, operations, administrative/clerical, and electricity/electronics. The effort was conducted in two phases. The first phase was designed to determine which S/Ks should be taught by identifying S/Ks that were prerequisites for success in the selected Class &quot;A&quot; schools. The second phase involved the development and administration of four JOBS courses. Materials  developed for each course included a student guide, an instructor guide, supporting training and testing materials, and a set of evaluation tests. Tests were administered before and after students took the JOBS courses. Students increased their mastery of selected basic S/Ks as a result of JOBS training; and students made greater gains in comprehension of technical terms than in mathematics. Recommendations were made for future JOBS courses: (1) close contact should be established between course developers and the &quot;A&quot; schools; (2) course developers should observe classroom JOBS instruction; (3) JOBS courses should not be developed for complex, highly technical subjects unless technically competent instructors are available; (4) instructor guide format should be modified; and (5) overhead  transparencies should generally not be used.

        "description":"A study examined the effect of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) Reauthorization Act of 1978 on public service employment (PSE) programs. A field survey, conducted during June and July 1979 (two months after provisions of the amendment went into effect), assessed the early effects of the reauthorization in the following areas: serving the disadvantaged; wages, jobs, and services; transition to unsubsidized employment; and planning and administration. The act's wage and eligibility provisions are the two major forces shaping the PSE program. Because wage provisions are forcing prime sponsors to eliminate or restructure high wage PSE positions, new PSE jobs have become less attractive to persons with alternative employment opportunities and more accessible to  persons with limited qualifications. The wage provisions have also reduced the number of available professional and skilled positions. Stiffer eligibility criteria not only increase the share of disadvantaged persons participating in PSE programs, but also reduce the proclivity of sponsors to use PSE workers to provide essential public services. The goal of combining training and other employability development services with PSE jobs has remained CETA's most elusive goal. Eight recommendations for improving the PSE program were made. (MN)",

An extension of Lazarus' Multimodal Behavior Therapy, the model contains eight factors that make up the acronym: behavior, emotion, self-talk, thought, interpersonal relationships, developmental level, economic and societal factors, and alpha factors. BEST IDEA systematically guides the student, teacher, and counselor through the career development process. As a guide to assessment and intervention it ensures that specific career behavioral needs of individual students are addressed. It includes &quot;assessment rules&quot; that direct individual career development evaluation in a stepwise comprehensive fashion. The  aim of assessment is the student's construction of an individualized plan for career development. The student links appropriate intervention strategies with specific needs and enhancing prevention strategies with identified strengths. Interventions include a variety of individual and group activities that may be classified as psychological education, social skills training, and behavioral counseling. Preventive exercises include values clarification, life coping skills training, and other psychological education efforts. Evaluation of outcomes of the model is an ongoing process. Data for as many factors as possible should be secured for comprehensive evaluation. (YLB)",

        "description":"Project ACCESS, funded by the Office of Education and Employment of the U.S. Department of Education, is developing and field testing a method to further the recognition of women's life experience learning. In order to determine the transferability of women's life experience learning to employment and to vocational education, three activities were undertaken: (1) a survey of adult women's life experiences and identification of the skills learned through experience (conducted on 131 women, mostly between the ages of 35 and 55, who were attending women's centers, displaced homemaker centers, and counseling centers in seven states); (2) identification of the skills required in selected occupations and vocational education programs through a survey of employers and educators; and (3)  an analysis to estimate the proportion of adult women who would have learned, through their life experiences, the skills required in these occupations and programs. The results of the study confirmed the basic hypothesis that adult women have a wide variety of life experiences through which they acquire skills and knowledge relevant to employment and to vocational education. As homemakers, the women in this sample assumed responsibility for the welfare of their families and their communities, while spending their &quot;free&quot; time developing advanced skills and new areas of expertise. It can be concluded that the experientially developed skills of the women in this sample are transferable to the Project ACCESS occupations and vocational education programs. The findings of this study underscore  the importance of recognizing life experience learning and the potential usefulness of self-ratings of competence when selecting women for jobs and educational programs.

The study objective was to determine if further investigation of use of PSI was worthwhile. From a review of literature and practice of PSI and adult learning, conclusions were drawn regarding major factors to consider when developing and implementing a PSI program for nontraditional adult learners. Suggestions were related to five basic elements of PSI: materials, mastery requirement, self-pacing, peer proctors, and motivational lectures. Two large subpopulations of nontraditonal adult learners were identified as needing the educational assistance PSI offers--persons needing adult basic education and adults in correctional institutions. Three adult  basic education classes of a public continuing education institution were selected for implementation of a PSI program; two other classes served as comparison groups. Twenty-five PSI students mastered 48 language and 69 mathematics units. They showed average gains of almost one grade level in reading comprehension and more than one grade level in arithmetic computation and problem solving. No gains were indicated for comparison students. Areas for research were identified for the five elements of PSI. (YLB)",

It discusses practical findings on each of the five basic elements of PSI, as they pertain to adult learners: written materials, mastery, self-pacing, peer proctors, and motivational lectures. Chapter 3 presents findings from a review of literature on adult learning. Section A outlines some general qualities of adult learners and their implications for development of instructional  materials and strategies. Section B briefly discusses some characteristics of nontraditional adult learners and several subpopulations considered promising for PSI implementation. Chapter 4 first summarizes some conclusions drawn relative to the research question of whether or not further investigation of PSI use for nontraditional adult learners is worthwhile. Conclusions are grouped under the five general chacteristics of PSI. Some suggestions are then outlined for development and implementation of a PSI program for nontraditional adult learners.

Proposed program settings were two classes of adult basic education students and one of prison inmates. A case study approach was planned for each selected implementation site with primary emphasis on collection of observational information and collection of some comparison data. Due to internal problems, the prison class was dropped and an alternate setting selected, and actual enrollment was lower than expected. PSI students completed over 100 units of language and mathematics instruction. Almost a grade level increase in reading comprehension was  indicated as was more than a grade level increase in both arithmetic computation and problem solving. Researchers also determined questions considered to represent issues for further research for PSI potential for teaching nontraditional adult learners.

        "description":"Data derived from a National Center for Education Statistics study of 58,728 high school sophomores and seniors, entitled &quot;High School and Beyond,&quot; was used to describe youth employment experiences and attitudes. The data showed that employment is common among high school students and seems to be an integral part of adolescence; employment possibly may be necessary for the smooth transition to adult job-holding, at least for those students who do not go to college. Another major finding of the study was that as early as the sophomore year, most jobs held by high school students were structured jobs. Furthermore, a shift seems to take place during the high school years in the types of jobs students have, going from more unstructured jobs such as babysitting and grass mowing to  structured jobs in food services, factories, sales, and clerical occupations. However, job experience varied widely among students of all types, and females generally worked fewer hours and were paid less per hour than males. Overall, the largest differences in work experience were found between sophomore and senior students. The senior students more closely resembled the adult labor force in every aspect considered in this study. Thus, even while youth are still in school, there appears to be a gradual movement toward greater involvement in work, and any evaluation of the teenage work experience would greatly depend on the stage at which it was observed.

During the 1978-79 school year, the school food service director, teachers, food service employees and noon aides from three schools in Macomb County received training in nutrition concepts and activities. The teachers subsequently trained other teachers in each of their buildings in a halfday inservice workshop. Based upon this experience, the teachers developed a Nutrition Education Curriculum that included activities for integrating nutrition  education into other subject areas. Through consolidation of training techniques based on this experience, and using the trainer of trainers model, Project SNACK spread to other schools during the next two years, having an impact on a total of 2,670 students, 89 classroom teachers, and two food service directors during 1980-81. Pre- and posttests of students and measures of nutrition concepts by teachers all demonstrated significantly positive results in knowledge gained. Project SNACK has demonstrated that the trainer of trainers model is practical and beneficial for infusing nutrition education in elementary schools and should be maintained and disseminated to other interested schools and school districts.

        "description":"This curriculum guide, updated from the Iowa 1973 version, is geared to vocational and technical agriculture instructors, to meet their needs in planning and conducting instructional programs for their students. Students completing instruction in agricultural supplies and services should have (1) explored the field of agricultural supplies and services occupations and made tentative career choices; and (2) developed attitudes, competencies, and job skills needed for successful job entry or employment in these fields. The guide is organized into seven units, covering the following subjects: opportunities in agricultural supplies and services, human relations, sales, business records and procedures, organization and operation of agricultural businesses, product knowledge of  agricultural supplies, and laws and regulations affecting agricultural businesses. The units are organized around a problem-solving approach to lesson planning. Each unit is divided into a series of problems, and each problem area features study questions, reference materials, interest approach, learning activities, conclusion, evaluation criteria, and optional learning activities. Keys, information sheets, and transparency masters are included for use in conducting the learning activities suggested. A list of occupational titles and tips on evaluating progress in the course also are included in the publication. (KC)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to test the following hypotheses concerning division of household labor (DOHL) between husbands and wives: (1) the division of household labor is somewhat affected by the availability of time, especially the wife's time; (2) there are strong effects of relative power, as measured by market-related resources, marital commitment, and decision making; and (3) weak effects are expected for sex-role attitudes, and taste for housework, particularly for the husband's taste. Data from the study comes from a subsample of 1,364 husband-wife units, part of a national probability sample of United States households interviewed in 1978. The available-time hypothesis was tested using spouses' employment status; relative interpersonal power was measured by earnings and  education ratios of husbands and wives, by spouses' perceptions of decision making, and by frequency of thoughts of divorce for each person; and sex-role ideologies were measured by husbands' and wives' summated responses to questions about women's and men's work, family roles, and taste for housework. Results showed the following: (1) the wife's time (as measured by employment status) affects the DOHL more than does the husband's; (2) the DOHL relates to relative power only as reflected by the husband's thought of divorce; (3) it relates to sex-role attitudes of the spouse whose perceptions of the DOHL are being measured, and most strongly to the husband's; and (4) it relates to the wife's taste for housework, unless controlled for the wife's employment status.

However, instruments to evaluate the vocational ability of these persons have been scarce or unsuitable, and attempts to adapt existing instruments or to develop new methods of evaluating these persons have been fragmentary. In this report, a researcher from England, unfettered by the constraints of particular United States schools of thought, summarizes current thinking in the field of vocational evaluation of severely physically handicapped adults. The report summarizes traditional do's and don'ts that will be helpful to the beginning rehabilitation professional, while also including complex procedures which are new or those which  vocational evaluators have tended not to adopt because of their complexity. Topics covered in the publication include (1) types of vocational evaluation, including pre-vocational evaluation, prescriptive evaluation, and predictive evaluation; (2) modifications to vocational evaluation tools, including discussion of psychometric tests, work samples and manual dexterity tests, and situational assessment and job tryouts; and (3) special techniques such as rehabilitation engineering, use of micro-motor analysis to establish motion times, and the Available Motions Inventory.

        "author":["Bhola, H. S."],
        "description":"A two-pronged theory underlying literacy campaigns suggests that (1) the prevailing ideology of a society will determine the objectives of the literacy campaign as well as the language of justification used by the development elite in the promotion of adult literacy; and (2) the ideology, as expressed in the political culture of a society, will influence the technology of a literacy campaign in regard to the strategies used for the articulation of the national commitment; the mobilization of the masses; and the establishment of organizational structures, the management of incentives for the recruitment of participants and teachers, the development of curricula, and the design of systems for the delivery of instruction. This two-pronged theory can be seen at work in the literacy  campaigns conducted in Tanzania and Kenya, where differing ideologies have resulted in differing methods for promoting literacy. Tanzania follows a socialist ideology, and emphasizes literacy as a tool for the participation of the masses in society in its very successful literacy campaign. Kenya, on the other hand, while following an espoused socialist philosophy, supports individual initiatives and thus uses different programs and incentives, with less success so far, in its less committed literacy campaign. Other studies of literacy campaigns also show much greater success rates in totalitarian than in free societies. Therefore, it is clear that democracies will have to better articulate their ideological positions on literacy and they will have to extend the conception of democracy to  include political, social, and economic democracy if they expect to achieve success in literacy efforts.

        "description":"About 2.7 of every 10 16- through 24-year-olds unemployed during March, 1979, were discharged from their last jobs. Regression analysis of data from the March, 1979, Current Population Survey revealed that 16- and 17 year-olds were more than twice as likely as 20- through 24-year-olds to have lost their last job; veterans were about 1.5 times as likely as non-veterans to have been job losers. Gender, race, marital status, and educational attainment were related only slightly to job loss. As long as it is believed or known that job loss among teenagers and young adults has negative consequences for individuals and society, then several alternative plans can be listed for reducing the incident of job loss. First, teenagers and young adults can be encouraged to prepare for and to  seek employment in industries and occupations that provide stable employment in spite of economic fluctuations. Second, technical, communications, and personal/social skills of teenagers and young adults can be improved on the condition that job loss among youth is caused, for the most part, by their skill deficits and not by the condition of the economy.

Ethnography essentially means \"a way of systematically learning reality from the point of view of the participant.\" Four features distinguish ethnographic research from other research methods: (1) the research is considered as an instrument of the research; (2) research is guided by an inductive, serendipitous, holistic perspective of the research problem and process; (3) research methods are designed to be used \"in situ,\" that is, in the natural setting in which the human behavior of interest to the researcher is occurring; and(4) the results of ethnographic research often lack the capacity to startle their consumers because these results frequently take on  a commonplace character and tone. Ethnographic methods might provide a fruitful alternative to common research methodology for studying problems of the education/work connection, such as studies of job skill acquisition and adaptability, employer preferences in hiring youth, youth employability problems, reasons for student enrollment in vocational education, and effects of vocational education on youth's ability to acquire and progress in jobs. The ethnographic approach should not become just a fad, however. Many approaches to research problems will be needed to create the knowledge we need to improve the transition of youth from school to work. (KC)",

A survey of state directors of vocational education, special education, and vocational rehabilitation was conducted to ascertain the number and comprehensiveness of state-level interagency agreements among their respective agencies. It was found that over the past two years the states appear to have done a comprehensive and thorough job of developing interagency agreements, and are now making efforts to update those agreements. The main part of this document is made up of examples of 29 current interagency agreements that may offer ideas for states and local  agencies to use in developing and refining their individual interagency agreements. Several innovative arrangements for sharing programs, inservice training, support services, assessment services, etc., are contained in the agreements. The last section of the compendium includes abstracts of several interagency resource documents that have been developed by federal and state agencies. (KC)",

        "description":"Public Law 94-142 and other federal legislation mandate that all handicapped children receive a free and appropriate public education, including vocational education. In order to implement these provisions, personnel development of vocational and special education personnel is needed; therefore, each state that applies for federal funds must submit a three-year state plan that includes a Comprehensive System for Personnel Development (CSPD). A study of all state plans and several territory plans was undertaken to determine the extent to which vocational educators participate, and the extent to which vocational and career education content is present in the planning. The areas of CSPD concern included participatory input and implementation, needs assessment, preservice training,  inservice training, incentives for inservice trainee participation, funding, inservice training participants, and vocational education manpower needs relative to educating handicapped learners. The findings and conclusions of the study suggest that vocational educators and vocational and career education content are not reflected extensively in comprehensive personnel planning in the states relative to the education of handicapped children and youth. The analysis also suggests that special education and vocational education continue not to coordinate their personnel preparation efforts to any significant extent. Recommendations include that vocational educators take a more active role in CSPD planning, that they be included in the special education inservice training, and that the needs  assessment be used to revise personnel development programs.

        "description":"A study was conducted to examine the extent to which program improvement funds from Public Law 94-482 were used by states to aid state vocational education programs serving handicapped and disadvantaged students through research, exemplary and innovative programs, curriculum development, vocational guidance and counseling, and vocational education personnel training. Information was gathered through a survey of state research coordinating unit (RCU) directors, in all states, with 100 percent participation. The study indicated that the 10 percent handicapped and 20 percent disadvantaged set-aside funds were not generally used by most states to fund program improvement programs and activities. This does not necessarily suggest that the states have not funded program improvement  activities that had an impact upon special needs learners, nor that the set-asides have not been appropriately used as basic grants to support the excess costs of educating handicapped an disadvantaged students in vocational education. Future state funding policies should reflect increased collaboration among vocational education, special education, vocational rehabilitation, and other agencies. Program efforts should be made to meet the needs of the handicapped and disadvantaged populations with potentially less funds and funding sources.

Data from the survey were correlated with data obtained during hour-long interviews of five pairs of mentor-proteges. Most respondents encountered their mentors during the &quot;entering early adulthood&quot; stage of life. While men have a  greater tendency to be mentors of men than of women, the women in the study had as their mentors, almost evenly, men and women.

Following development, 11 modules were field tested at three field test sites in Kentucky and revised according to evaluative data. A questionnaire was developed so that approximately 40 health career students, along with advisors, at each field test site evaluated the 11 modules. The modules were subsequently revised and four additional modules developed. Information from the students and advisors showed that (1) the various sections of the modules were satisfactory to both  students and advisors; (2) HOSA activities can be made an integral part of health occupations education; (3) affective feelings and values, such as satisfaction in learning, commitment, respect, understanding of the group process, and pride can be increased through HOSA activities; and (4) while using the modules, student autonomy was affected to a low degree. Recommendations were made to change the format of the modules by binding them into a single volume, and to make additions to the manual's Instructor Guide; recommendations were also made for modifications in developing the modules and infusing them into the curriculum.

        "description":"This publication, through six chapters, discusses three exemplary methods of sharing resources in allied health education and provides allied health administrators and educators with an overview of the human factors needed for successful interinstitutional cooperation. Chapter 1 introduces the concept of cooperative sharing and provides the basis for the case studies (chapters 2-4) that follow. The Eastern Virginia Health Education Consortium case study illustrates an arrangement within a community or substate region and provides a model for interinstitutional planning. The Alabama Linkage Story describes a model of statewide sharing that links the resources of the state's junior colleges with specialized facilities and capabilities of an academic health center. The  Mississippi-Louisiana Experience demonstrates a multistate sharing of resources where programs in occupational therapy and medical records administration are shared between two major institutions in adjoining states. Chapter 5 reviews the human factors needed to enhance successful cooperative activities. This chapter discusses proper environment, leadership, group dynamics, common goals, institutional missions, data base, human parameters, communication, perceptions, and documentation. Chapter 6 generalizes from the findings of the three case studies that sharing arrangements can provide advantages to allied health programs by extending resources, containing costs, avoiding duplication, and improving program quality.

These are changes in the demographic profile and retirement practices, regional shifts in economic activity and in employment, and renewal of the industrial sector as a key ingredient in economic growth. Because of inflation, greater life expectancies, and changes in public policy and social attitudes, older persons will remain in the work force longer and will thereby become considerably more important in the market for vocational programs, provided that their needs and the need for sustaining enrollments in vocational education receive priority in the coming decades. Regional shifts in employment and economic activity have created the need for increased supplies of  trained personnel in rapid growth areas. Recent inflation, high unemployment, and slow productivity growth rates will increase opportunities in technical and service fields and reduce opportunities for semiskilled factory operatives. If vocational education is to respond adequately to this major restructuring of the industrial economy, it must become aware of the economic changes at hand. (MN)",

Although vocational education has grown substantially in size in recent years, its quality is spotty, characterized by excellent programs in some communities and poor programs in others. In order to contribute to reindustrialization, vocational education must serve better its three major groups for the work of the future: training young people for work, retraining present employees, and retraining those who are reentering the labor force. Only the first of these components has received serious efforts. There are four keys to quality in vocational education: content, trainees, facilities, and staff. The quality of vocational education is affected most by what is done  on the local level. Local programs should pay more attention to updating skills, keeping their teachers up to date, replacing obsolete training equipment, and servicing various populations, such as the handicapped, older workers, and rural residents. At the same time, the improvement of vocational education could be facilitated on the federal level by increased emphasis on vocational education research and development, especially focusing on improvement in teaching methods and programs, rather than maintenance of the status quo. Only if these changes are made will vocational education contribute to the reindustrialization of America without lost time, money, and human resources. (KC)",

Chapter 1 of the report discusses federal interest in vocational education as indicated in the Vocational Education Act and by  economic analysis. A summary follows of recent Commission research on the labor market effects of secondary vocational education and postsecondary training, comparing and contrasting results with those found in other studies. Chapter 2 reviews federal interest in occupational information, discusses strengths and weaknesses of techniques used in occupational forecasting, and considers vocational education's role in occupational labor markets. Chapter 3 examines coordination to determine legislative changes to facilitate linkages between the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act and vocational education programs. Concerns include developing a common goal, funding, joint planning, involvement with other organizations, and personnel interaction. (YLB)",

It considers available data on these issues to provide insights into the recurrent nurse shortage for a more rational basis for policy-making. Chapter 1 examines nurses' wages, wage growth, fringe benefits, and labor force participation rates, comparing each of them to similar information on other workers in the United States economy. Using that information, the chapter assesses conflicting interpretations of nurses' wage levels and labor supply behavior. Chapter 2 deals with nurse staffing and vacancies in hospitals; examines the origin and interpretation of data on budgeted vacant positions in hospitals, the most often cited  evidence of the nurse shortage; and reviews studies of variations in staffing among hospitals for evidence of effects of shortages on hospital operations. Chapter 3 delves into determinants of the total supply of nurses in terms of factors affecting the annual numbers of entrants to nursing schools. A technical appendix provides information on estimation of starting salaries for registered nurses, regression results of a number of nursing school entrants, and specification error tests. (YLB)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to obtain information about the extent of consumer knowledge of the medical care delivery system and to derive a scale to measure it. A 10-item questionnaire was administered to 4976 persons aged 14-66 in Ohio, Massachusetts, South Carolina, and Washington to measure their consumer sophistication. Some items assessed extent of consumer knowledge related to choosing providers. Others assessed consumer knowledge related to use of medical services for a particular problem. Four stages of analyses identified differences across content areas and across study sites, tested appropriateness of constructing a multi-item summary measure of consumer sophistication, examined reliability and validity of an eight-item scale, and performed regressions to describe  population differences in consumer sophistication. Analyses of individual items suggested that consumers are knowledgeable about some matters and uninformed about others. Efforts at educating consumers about board certification, staff privileges, and other information pertinent to choosing a regular source of care seemed warranted. Factor analyses indicated that a substantial amount of the information contained in item responses can be summarized in a multi-item scale score. The reliability and validity of the scale as a measure of patient sophistication was supported. (YLB)",

        "description":"For America to sustain a high standard of living and set aside the resources needed for national security, at least a decade of shoring up productive capacity is required--a period of reindustrialization. The United States has been underdeveloping, with too much consumption of goods and resources and too little investment in the national economic machinery. Two opposite economic approaches have been advanced to remedy this situation: supply-side economics and industrial policy. Supply-side economists favor tax reduction, with the deficit made up by taxes paid by a growing economy spurred by the free market place and private investment of capital; while the advocates of an industrial policy propose a government-led economic development program, with government bureaucracy to  determine winning industries, subsidize and promote them, while allowing losers to close, with government help to retrain and relocate their workers. Between supply-side economics and industrial policy is the concept of reindustrialization. The suggested cure for the economic malaise is semitargeted: release resources to the private sector, but channel them to the infrastructure and capital goods sectors--away from either public or private consumption, resulting in a stronger productive capacity. Vocational education belongs to the agenda of reindustrialization primarily because of its concern with the size, composition, and quality of human capital. At the present time, however, vocational education is not supplying workers with needed &quot;employability skills.&quot; Before it can contribute to  reindustrialization, vocational education must determine why those skills are not being developed.

        "description":"The job market should be considered as interaction between supply and demand, and not from the perspective of new and emerging occupations. Three recent major post-World War II changes in the human resources posture have tended to create labor surpluses: shift from rural South to urban North, increased number of working women, and the postwar baby boom, whose high school dropout led to a youth unemployment problem and whose college graduates created an even greater labor surplus. Several theories attempt to explain the tightening job market and overeducation of Americans and elimination of jobs by automation and technology. A decrease in the country's birthrate pattern will lead to a shortage of human resources in the eighties. A principle of the job market is that two of three  job openings are replacing someone leaving an existing position. The third job opens up due to growth, and only a small proportion are in new and emerging occupations. The fastest growing jobs will not require a four-year college education. An examination of the spring 1980 &quot;Occupational Outlook Quarterly&quot; shows that new occupations will account for only a small part of the job openings in the next decade. Most jobs will be in the replacment market. (YLB)",

All sections begin with an introduction that provides background development information and closes with suggested strategies. The organizational objectives, roles, and relationships of PICs are discussed in section 1 so as to encourage experimentation in the private sector and to promote changes within the existing employment training system. Section 2 highlights the planning, management, and evaluation (PME) process; discusses  the usefulness and benefits to be derived from implementation of the process; and suggests how the PME process can contribute to the success of the PIC. The advantages and disadvantages of classroom training, on-the-job training, customized training, upgrading and retraining, pre-employment and job search, and youth and other targeted programs are discussed in the next section. The final section defines Employment Generating Services (EGS) in terms of marketing activities, labor market information, economic development linkages, and other supportive services.

        "description":"A conceptual model is presented to examine the hypothesis that androgyny is advantageous to the psychological well-being of both females and males in American society. A format for the multi-dimensional assessment of both sex-role components and indices of well-being is proposed, and possibilities for exploring the interface between these sets of measures are suggested. The model conceptualizes sex roles with four major sources of variation, i.e., gender, tasks assigned by gender and age, skills involved in completing tasks, and evaluation of the job assignment, as well as the assessment of psychological well-being in terms of self-esteem, personal distress, interpersonal and task competence, and social and situational support. Ideological dilemmas for the androgyny researcher  are considered in terms of how: (1) current research fails to support the positive well-being outcome for androgynous persons across age groups and in situational contexts; (2) the well-being hypothesis may be differentially valid within varying developmental periods and particularly questionable for children; and (3) situational outcomes tend to be negative for persons who adopt nontraditional responding modes. Approaches for resolving these dilemmas are also suggested. (Author/NRB)",

        "description":"Individual differences in the motivation and skill to manage impressions can be measured by the Self-Monitoring Scale. \"Blind\" dating encounters were established to investigate whether complementarity rather than similarity in partner's self-monitoring would lead to greater attraction and satisfaction with the relationship. College students (N=64 couples) completed the Self-Monitoring Scale, the Bem Androgyny Scale, and personal data forms. Pairs of subjects met each other and conversed briefly. After the initial meeting, subjects completed Dion Scales to give impressions of their partners. Pairs then dated each other exclusively for three weeks (a minimum of three dates) and then completed a final Dion Scale. Results showed that high self-monitoring women were more favorable  than low self-monitoring women about their dates, regardless of males' levels of self-monitoring. All males, however, preferred low self-monitoring women. These findings provide no evidence that complementarity of self-monitoring affects attraction in a dating situation. (NRB)",

The effectiveness of scholastic success and social support in raising students' self-esteem, integrating students with their school, and decreasing incidents of delinquency and disruption is examined. Details about the students and the alternative schools are described and the study design comparing alternative and conventional students is explained. Findings are given and comparisons among the alternative programs are made. Conclusions in this report  indicate that poor scholastic experiences are significant causes of delinquent and disruptive behavior, and positive scholastic experiences make a difference in the behavior of only those students whose delinquency seems effective in defending against negative impacts.

        "description":"Previous research has indicated that father absence detrimentally affects children's cognitive functioning. Demographic data and Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores were gathered from 55 females and 45 females from divorced families where the mother received custody, 19 females and 21 males with a deceased father, and a group of matched control subjects from intact families who were similar in age, sex and academic major to the divorce and death groups. No significant differences were found in any aspect of SAT performance. To examine the effects of parental absence on the sex role development of children, 27 males and 49 females of divorced parents with maternal custody and 23 females and 10 males who experienced paternal death were matched on sex and age with subjects from  intact families. All subjects completed the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) and a demographic questionnaire. Although the BSRI masculinity score averaged about two points higher for both sexes in the parent-absent groups, no differences were statistically significant. Although trends were identified, further analysis revealed no significant differences between groups in the number of subjects in each classification. The findings tend to support a cognitive developmental perspective and suggest a need for continuing research on the effects of parental absence on sex role development and intellectual functioning.

        "description":"In the past only academic variables have performed well in the prediction of attrition. Ideally, persons in higher education would like to predict attrition prior to its occurrence, but many academic variables are not available until after the fact. Thus, the isolation of those motivational and personality variables which identify individuals as \"high risk,\" or potential dropouts is critical. Biographical information can be useful in this context because it is a good predictor of any criterion heavily saturated with motivation. To identify academic and nonacademic factors which predict attrition within the college freshman year, biographical information from student questionnaires was assessed. Results demonstrated that dropouts and persisters could be differentiated on the basis  of nonacademic background factors. Male persisters had backgrounds of high academic achievement in high school, higher socioeconomic status, and were allowed more freedom by their parents than male dropouts. Female persisters had histories of previous leadership experience, closer relationships to their mothers, and higher academic achievement in high school than female dropouts. Additionally, subgroups of males identified as \"high risk\" remained stable in terms of their dropout composition over an eight-year period. The findings suggest a strategy for identifying, at the time of admission, whole groups of potential dropouts and for planning some type of intervention to prevent attrition. (Author/JAC)",

The process used to conduct this study involved four steps: identifying new and changing occupations, collecting information about the occupations, locating available instructional materials, and assessing the need for curriculum development. Fifteen occupations were identified as either new or changing a great deal. Occupations that need curriculum development because very little if any instructional materials exist are catfish farm manager, computer drafting/graphics technician, and speech-language hearing assistant. Occupations that have a partial need for curriculum development (portions of curricula may be available or  a recombining of existing curricula may be needed) are cable television technician and aviation maintenance technician. Occupations that need to be observed closely because of their potential importance in the future include neurometrics technician, electromyography technician, hydroponic agriculture specialist, fiber optics technician, and personnel and labor relations specialist. Occupations that are changing and that may or may not have adequate curricula, but for which schools seem to need help in implementing programs, are locksmith, word processing specialist, and welder.

The major objective of the third year was to obtain a more future-oriented perspective on needed research and development. To accomplish this objective, papers and proceedings from two conferences conducted by the National Center for Research in Vocational Education were analyzed to identify suggestions for research and development, and recommendations were obtained from a national panel of researchers and administrators. Among the findings was that all of these different sources agreed that in the 1980s vocational education will be a more diverse enterprise than it has been in the past. There are  likely to be more older clients and proportionally more minorities and individuals who will need special services. Anticipated high rates of technological innovation and limited resources for modernization of equipment indicate that vocational education will have to cooperate much more with employers and other providers of training.

Its basis was the position that the institutional leadership capacity of divisions of vocational education substantially affects the dynamics of vocational education. The first of two major tasks--a series of sixty-four discussion sessions--involved 222 state and local education officials in nine states to obtain perceptions as to the organizational, economic, and political considerations related to improving the responsiveness of state vocational divisions. The second task--development of a demographic and professional profile of vocational state staff--was conducted by mailed survey questionnaire. Forty-eight states  volunteered to participate; 1,819 state staff responded. Results indicated staff hired within the last four years tend to be younger and composed of a higher percentage of women, and a large percentage are new to their state agency and/or position.

A guidebook published by the Training Analysis and Evaluation Group was used in creating the memory aids. Navy school personnel used the guidebook to develop two training booklets incorporating memory aids. One booklet taught telephone codes for sound-powered phones to sailors in apprentice training school. The other booklet taught sailors how to recognize and respond to ten common navigation buoys. The booklets were evaluated in a classroom setting. Test scores for trainees who used the memory aids were much higher than the scores of trainees who were taught in the traditional way; study time was reduced by half. In the case of  buoys, the group taught using memory aids scored 93 percent on the test as compared to 51 percent for the group taught using the traditional technique. In the case of the phone circuit code names, the group taught using memory aids scored 84 percent on the test compared to 63 percent for the group taught using the traditional technique. The study further verified the widespread knowledge that memory aids are beneficial in increasing student performance in rote learning situations, and it demonstrated that given adequate guidelines, memory aids can be developed by school personnel who have not had previous training in this activity.

Other findings include that public administration and agriculture and services were groups of industries employing large proportions of workers who moonlighted; second jobs were largely in agriculture, self-employment, and services; and farmers and farm managers and  professional and technical workers reported higher moonlighting rates. These reasons for moonlighting are indicated: meeting regular expenses, saving for future, enjoying the work, paying off debts, getting experience.

        "description":"Research was conducted to assess the applicability of the Instructional Systems Development (ISD) job analysis procedures to nine technical aviation maintenance military occupational specialties (MOS). Job analysis questionnaires were developed for each of the nine aviation maintenance MOS's. Research teams administered the questionnaires to groups of job incumbents and supervisors. Job incumbents rated their applicable tasks on a Relative Time Spent Performing scale. Supervisors rated all their MOS tasks on four scales: Task Learning Difficulty, Consequences of Inadequate Performance, Immediacy of Task Performance, and Type of Training. The data indicated that the ISD four-factor model of job analysis was applicable for identifying task training priority in the technical MOS's.  The four factor scales correlated highly with the criterion scale (Type of Training) in all MOS's. A further analysis was conducted by splitting the tasks into those expected to be done mostly by incumbents and those inspection, supervision, and management tasks normally done by supervisors. The four factor scales correlated very highly with the criterion scale for the incumbent tasks and moderately highly for the supervisor tasks. Since the relative influence of the factor scales varied by MOS, however, the training priority policy of supervisors appears to be MOS specific, and the model will have to be adapted individually for each specialty.

In its first year of operation, the Tennessee NET program conducted summer nutrition education workshops for elementary teachers and school food service managers, distributed nutrition education materials, and funded nine pilot nutrition education projects throughout the state. Evaluators at the University of Tennessee (1) used pre- and posttests of nutrition knowledge as well as attitudinal measures to assess the effectiveness of the 1979 summer workshops; (2) assessed usage rates, quality, and developmental appropriateness of materials distributed; (3) evaluated four of  the pilot projects; and (4) designed K-12 assessment instruments and used them in forty-eight schools throughout the state to collect baseline data on nutrition knowledge, attitudes, behavior, and perceptions of nutrition education from a sample of students, parents, teachers, principals, and food service personnel. No systematic differences between responses of students in treatment and comparison schools were detected in the initial testing. Personnel in one-half the elementary schools where baseline data were collected in spring 1980 were to receive training in NET workshops during summer 1980. In spring, 1981, data collected at the treatment schools were to be compared with that collected at untreated comparison schools to provide an assessment of the effectiveness of the 1980  NET-sponsored training in nutrition education.

A second project activity focused on developing and pilot testing a needs assessment instrument to measure individual educators' perceived needs for training within each phase of twelve domains and their preferences for the delivery of this training. The instrument was designed to provide data to assist inservice planners/deliverers in decision-making efforts at local, state,  and/or national levels. A pilot test of the instrument was conducted in six Minnesota schools to determine the extent to which the instrument could be shown to exhibit face, content, utility, and construct validity. Pilot test results indicated that the instrument could give useful data for making inservice/preservice planning decisions and that population subgroups had differing training needs. This instrument can provide planning information, but may need to be tailored to various populations' levels of awareness and expertise. (Author)",

        "description":"Faced with declining attendance, poor reputation, and possible demise of their program, students in the Adult Liberal Studies (ALS) program at the University of Toledo formed an association, evaluated the program, and instigated constructive changes that have revitalized the program, increased its enrollment, and enhanced its reputation among its students as well as among faculty members and in national circles. After forming the Adult Liberal Studies Student Association (ALSSA) in the fall of 1976, students determined ALS student characteristics, needs, and reasons for enrolling or discontinuing participation in the program through a survey of 175 active and 205 inactive enrollees (121 responses). The survey showed that students' main reason for enrolling in the program was  personal development, that few students received full financial assistance from employers, that most students were employed full time, and that students were dissatisfied with program inconsistencies, faculty disinterest, poor scheduling, undefined objectives, and general unconcern of the University for their needs. Armed with this data, representatives of the ALSSA met with the academic vice president and the University president, and presented their conclusions and suggestions. The University administration responded by defining objectives for the program and setting up seminars to meet these educational objectives by instituting faculty overload competition for the program to increase faculty participation in and enthusiasm for teaching adult students, and in general giving more  consideration to adult students' needs. As a result, by 1978, student enrollment in the program had increased, as had student satisfaction; the program's reputation grew among the University community and the program received the Quality in Liberal Learning (Quill) award from the Association of American Colleges.

        "description":"A two-year study addressed the problem of developing a typology of experiential education programs theoretically based and empirically tested that could guide systematic research on questions fundamental to workplace-based experiential education programs. The research question focused on was, \"Can experiential education programs be classified according to the relationship existing between workplace role expectations and learner needs and dispositions?\" The first year was a qualitative phase for collecting data. Interviews were conducted with students, program coordinators, and employers associated with eighteen programs in four different states. Data analysis consisted of four steps. First, nine program characteristics were identified as indicators of the normative (referring to  work organizations, their roles, their expectations) and personalistic (referring to experiential learners, their personalities, their needs and dispositions) dimensions. Next, interview data were categorized for all programs. Then data were converted to quantitative values to show the proportional relationship. Finally, results were displayed graphically to reveal the clustering of program types. In phase 2--the quantitative phase--students, program staff, and employers involved in thirty-one programs in Ohio, Florida, Iowa, Arizona, California, and Oregon were selected as the sample for completing the instrument which gathered information on the nine program characteristics. Results were the determination of the normative-personalistic proportions for each of the programs and the  resultant classification schema. Five recommendations were made.

Three hundred twenty high school juniors and seniors from Gainesville (Georgia) High School completed the questionnaires. Analysis of covariance was used to determine patterns in the way the  environments of home, school, and work are linked and how they relate to more positive scores on the dependent measures. In addition, school personnel prepared in-depth descriptions of three programs which placed youth in work settings as part of their education. The most significant finding was that there is an ecology of youth development that appears related to performance on such measures as the two used. Recommendations for research were developed.

The learning interval was designated as the time between pre- and post-testing, and the retention interval as the time between post- and follow-up testing. The results indicated (1) differences in two areas--in reading skills versus math skills and in traditional learning environments versus learning-in-work  environments; (2) math congnitive concepts causally related but not in the hierarchical order predicted by Bloom's taxonomy; (3) different causal processes in the acquisition of math concepts, depending upon placement in one of the two learning environments; (4) significant relationships between students' cognitive style and their math performance; and (5) moderate relationships between students' perceptions of complexity of learning environment and their math performance.

        "description":"A review of literature on improving women's occupational potential was conducted. Most existing theories of occupational development focus on males. However, the beginnings of several theories of women's occupational development have recently been proposed. These are (1) structural theories, revolving around personality traits and ability patterns and (2) developmental theories, emphasizing the stages in the decision-making process involved in occupational choice. Several factors limit women's occupational potential. These include self-concept and the sense of competence; such motivational aspects of occupational development as aspirations, expectations, and attitudes; and the acquisition of educational means to occupational attainment (the acquisition of knowledge, training, and  skills through career education, vocational education, and the practical arts). Modeling sex-typed behaviors, sex-stereotyped expectations and attitudes, and different behavioral interaction patterns with male and female students are among ways in which teachers contribute to differences in occupational development. Parental attitudes, expectations, and sex role socialization practices and peer and visual media influences also contribute to sex differences in occupational development. Sex role stereotypes and sex-typed occupational aspirations are modifiable. Therefore, educators must develop and implement effective nonsexist interventions at the elementary and secondary level.

WICHE worked closely with a project advisory committee and the region's three schools of optometry to develop a regional plan. Personnel supply and demand in the western states were surveyed, and other regional educational plans were examined for their applicability to optometry in the West. It was found that the existing 3 schools of optometry can meet the needs of the 13 western states for educational opportunity and for labor supply; and that although supply is favorable, some maldistribution of practitioners exists among the states. The plan developed by WICHE includes the following program  components: (1) access and admission based on the needs of each state; (2) a cooperative network of off-campus clinical training sites; (3) a manpower program to encourage distribution; (4) resource sharing among the three schools of optometry; and (5) a financial plan. Coordination of the plan would occur at three levels: among schools, within each state, and at the regional level. A phased implementation schedule and budget are included. Although the region could support the plan's operation, further funding would be required to develop the new program components. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"A study examined the educational and occupational plans of Australian fourteen-year-olds as part of program of research on the transition to adulthood. A twenty-item questionnaire was administered to 969 students in 243 schools across Australia. The questionnaire contained items pertaining to respondents' State of residence, school system attended, year of schooling, school rurality, family background, sex, achievement in basic skills, achievement difficulties experienced, support of significant others, and self-concept of ability. Factors found to affect student achievement in primary school included school rurality, family rurality, ethnicity, large family size, family socioeconomic status, and sex. Failure to master basic literacy and numeracy skills at the primary school  level was directly linked to learning difficulties at the high school level. Successful mastery of basic skills at the primary level was also connected to self-conceptions of ability and plans to complete high school. Being non-English born and from a socioeconomically-advantaged family also had a positive effect on the decision to complete high school and seek further education. Family socioeconomic status and self-concept of ability exerted the two largest effects on occupational aspirations, with sex and family size also figuring as factors. (The questionnaire is appended.) (MN)",

The current status of education, training, and employment of personnel who work in the field of aging is depicted in terms of issues and problems inherent in the formulation of a unified manpower policy for measuring and meeting personnel needs in the aging field. Priorities expressed in the legislative mandate among federal agency programs, occupations, and employment settings providing services for older persons are outlined. The history and development of the study of the field of aging is  covered. Current federal training programs and related manpower development activities pertinent to the field of aging are reviewed, and recent studies on research or program evaluation of education, training, and employment personnel who work with older people are summarized. The findings and recommendations of these studies were analysed with respect to generic issues that have an impact on manpower development and specific priority personnel areas. Immediate manpower policy concerns and projected activities for further compliance with the mandate are discussed. (MN)",

Data were obtained from 1047 respondents (including trial and appellate judges, prosecutors, defenders, and court administrators) via personal interviews and mail questionnaires. Findings included the following: (1) nearly 20 percent of the respondents cited training as a generator of organizational change within the criminal justice system or personal change; (2) participants want training; (3) most sender organizations support attendance at training programs in a variety of  ways; (4) CTP institutes meet general training needs and provide a setting in which individuals can exchange ideas and discuss problems; and (5) training sessions suffer from shortcomings in needs assessment, balance of teaching methodologies, and instructor orientation. Thirty-four recommendations were made, and thirty-five tables present detailed data summaries.

This particular document is a colleciton of papers presenting alternative models for collaboration that relate to various aspects of adult learning and training. Model 1 is based on a meeting of experts in higher education who were brought together to identify critical gaps in our knowledge and understanding of adult learning that need to be addressed by educator trainers. The training connection between the business sector and institutions of higher education is addressed in Model 2, by discussing the need for clarifying the interpretations of training as a discipline and a  profession, and presenting a cooperative training model that attempts to capitalize on the interests and expertise of both business and higher education. In Model 3, the mission of schools of education is expanded to encompass the world beyond schooling by presenting an organizational model that brings together various academic units to address the training needs of workers. Using a medium-sized, private institution of higher education as a prototype, Model 4 reveals the extent of university faculty and administrator involvement and interest in adult learning-related endeavors and subsequent collaboration with colleages. Finally, Model 5 presents another means of collaboration among experts involving the development of a position paper by each participating professional that addresses a  common topic. (KC)",

For the symposium, a diverse group of nine selected participants were asked to respond to a number of critical questions concerning adult learning and training in the future. After an orientation by Winifred Warnat, in which she invites participants to be creative and daring, the first part of the report contains selected comments from group discussions. The second part of the report contains short papers given by the nine participants on the following  issues: learning versus information processing; meeting the stressful future; leisure and adult learning; the necessity of changing old patterns to meet adult learning needs; technology, folk heroes, and adult learning; dependency and authority as blocks to adult learning; the future of the education business; adult learning potential; and new models of learning. A short selection of random comments made during the symposium and a list of participants conclude the report. (KC)",

This particular document begins with a forecast of what might occur over the next twenty years in adult learning. The remaining five sections present critical issues that have implications for adult learning and training in the future. The first section focuses on the critical issue of unemployment, in which the &quot;humanness factor&quot; is presented as a major void in resolving the dilemmas faced by unemployed workers; next it provides a model that begins to address the dilemmas through the humanness factor. The next section acknowledges aging as a critical issue that  needs to be addressed through training practices, demonstrating a method by using the family as a model of training. Leisure is the critical issue focused upon in the third section, which discusses the importance of educators needing to understand the profound impact that increased leisure will have on society in the future; four training models are presented. The fourth critical issue identified is women, with special emphasis placed on the potential and emerging power of middle-aged women in molding our culture; this discussion is followed by a comprehensive training agenda. Finally, a leadership training model is set forth for addressing the fifth critical issue, community education.",

Divided into three sections, it addresses the basis for parent involvement, what it consists of, and what can be expected in the future. It includes a discussion of how parents and child-rearing practices have influenced the development of parenting and parent education programs. An analysis of numerous parent program models is presented, evaluating their strengths and weaknesses. In addition, critical issues and needs that parent  involvement should address as we move toward the next century are examined. The Overview is intended to serve as an introduction for educators, including parent educators, who are working with parents. Through the information provided, insights into program planning and development are given. Two significant issues are raised: parents are neglected as resources; and neither parents nor educators involved with parents are viewed as adult learners. (KC)",

This \"Family Academy Model\" provides one interpretation of how the family functions as educator. The report begins by revealing the dramatic changes that have taken place in American families during the past twenty years, based on the impact of lower birth rates, more women in the work force, higher divorce rates, postponement of marriage, and a changing economic climate. Chapter 2 discusses five alternative family forms--single-parent, reconstituted, non-kin, multigenerational, and retirement--and their implications for  educators. In chapter 3, the family life cycle is examined through the traditional nuclear family. Contributions to understanding how the family educates are highlighted in chapter 4, which includes some thoughts on the family's curriculum content. In chapter 5, the family academy concept is presented with a description of its four primary learning tasks--role selection, personality acquisition, value formation, and behavioral patterning. The five-step learning sequence of the family academy is the focal point of chapter 6 and is applied to the development of life skills through four critical life events. Chapter 7 concludes with a discussion of the future of the family. (KC)",

It addresses four areas that have significant bearing on parent education program designs. Those four areas are (1) previous participation, (2) attitudes about parent involvement, (3) handicapping conditions, and (4) participant demographics.

It contains directions for developing systematic, proactive equity plans for implementation by correctional agencies. The generalized planning model gives step-by-step instructions and general guidelines to be followed in producing correctional agency or institution plans which comply with legislative mandates and implement agency or institution goals for affirmative action and equal employment opportunity. Following a section of directions for users, the planning model consists of the three chapters in the guide and a flowchart. Since there are  three major parts which should be included in an agency plan, the three chapters describe briefly the three components, and give directions for writing each section in an agency plan. Chapter 1 tells how an agency develops a rationale for equity; Chapter 2 explains how an agency assesses needs for equity; and Chapter 3 describes how an agency sets goals and implements activities. The flowchart model, which is a graphic representation of the functions involved in planning, shows the three major functions described in the three chapters, and also shows the elements which make up each function. Appendixes contain a description of the development of the generalized planning model; sample forms for use in making equity plans; and a bibliography. (KC)",

Based on the experiences of 215 women in Allegheny County Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh), the booklet describes some of the problems they faced as they went through their educational programs, and shows some of the practical, workable ways in which they attacked their problems, i.e., their strategies. The guide is divided into two sections. Section 1 describes six &quot;case histories&quot; of women in various marital, family, income level, and social status situations (composites drawn from many women in these categories), and relates their problems with money, child care, relationships to  husbands and other family members; it then shows how they are coping and makes suggestions about how they could attack their problems more effectively. Part 2 presents some ideas for women preparing to start an educational program. Topics covered include choosing a school or training program, financial help, child care, choosing a career, and support networks. Names and addresses of potentially helpful organizations, as well as suggested references, are provided. The book concludes with a list of model programs for school administrators, counselors, trainers, and teachers that address the needs of women. (KC)",

        "description":"A critical review of literature on factors affecting nurse staffing in acute care hospitals, with particular regard for the consequences of a movement from team nursing to primary nursing care, was conducted. The literature search revealed a need for more research on the philosophy of nursing and nursing goals and policy as they relate to nurse staffing methodologies. Personnel and patient factors (especially education, staffing patterns, and the use of part-time and agency personnel) have been examined more or less rigorously. Care requirements as required by patient classification systems have also received intensive study. Nursing service organization, unit management, scheduling, and the modified work week are among management factors that have received descriptive treatment  in literature. However, study of the interrelationships of these factors have largely been ignored. Team nursing, the Loeb Center system, unit assignment, and primary nursing care are among the organizational modes of nursing that have been examined. Unit design, the use of computers as it affects nursing schedules, and the unit dose system are among the few environmental factors to affect nursing care discussed in literature.

In the third section are described three programs which illustrate the activity in operation. Section 4 overviews the basic structure of self-directed job search: information, skill building, and support. Section 5  addresses variables which PICs and CETA Prime Sponsors must consider in electing to implement a self-directed job search program in relation to resources and needs of locality as well as overall employment and training priorities. Limitations of self-directed job search are discussed in section 6. An annotated bibliography of selected job search materials is also provided.

The study included a review of literature, legislation, and exemplary programs, and conducted interviews with community leaders in twenty isolated, rural counties. Unstructured telephone interviews with representatives of the business, civic, and education sectors, supplemented by printed documents, resulted in the identification of problems facing vocational and adult education in rural areas. These included a lack of jobs, funding, and transportation; sparse populations; difficulties with teacher recruitment and retention; inadequate counseling and guidance services; lack of grantsmanship abilities; inaccessibility of services; student characteristics; and legislative mandates. The study  revealed the importance of preserving the autonomy of the rural community, simplifying funding applications, and changing funding formulas. Nine priority areas relating to economic development, teacher training, linkages, access to education, supplementary services, and the needs of special populations were identified. Six policy implications were derived. These included providing technical assistance and federal funds for rural vocational and adult education, sponsoring research responsive to priority areas, establishing an office of rural education as a linking agency with federal agencies, and encouraging state departments of education to re-evaluate their rural programs.

Where these competencies were actually learned, however, was not necessarily where the public perceived that they should be taught.

        "description":"A study was conducted to identify, assemble, and summarize all studies on the effects of vocational education that were reported from 1968 to 1979. Computer searches, reviews of bibliographies, card catalogues, direct solicitation of reports, and consultant recommendations yielded 117 local, state, regional, and national studies that met the criteria for the review. Studies were categorized according to the type of dependent variable that they addressed, as well as the level of schooling. The dependent variables fell into three broad categories: employment, education, and ancillary effects. In the area of employment effects, the results suggested that a higher percentage of vocational graduates (compared with nonvocational graduates) are employed upon graduation from high school;  however, the unemployment rates for the two groups are not significantly different. At the postsecondary level, two comparative studies found that postsecondary vocational education graduates experienced less unemployment than did individuals who did not have postsecondary training or who were enrolled in a nonvocational postsecondary program. In the area of educational effects, all twenty-one of the state and local studies that addressed satisfaction with training at the secondary level reported that the majority of the vocational students were satisfied with their training.

The study consisted of a review of literature; unstructured interviews with representatives of the business, civic, and educational sectors of rural areas; a review of pertinent legislation; and an examination of exemplary programs. The perceptions of the people who have the responsibility for providing vocational and adult education in the twenty isolated rural areas form the basis of the results. An overwhelming consensus was found concerning the lack of jobs in these rural areas. Lack of funding tied with lack of jobs was the most frequently mentioned  problem. Most of the schools and public services agencies cover large service areas, meaning their clients must travel long distances on poor or nonexistent roads, with no public transportation available. A wide range of problems were categorized as administrative programming, including limited populations, unavailability of qualified teachers, lack of guidance services, administrative burdens, and lack of services for adults.

Major project activities included a review of the literature, convening of a task force, the completion of site reports, a legislative review, and an examination of selected exemplary programs. Ten cities, each over one-half million population, were selected for the site report sample. Business, education, and community persons representing the sample cities were contacted by telephone and were asked for their views about problem/needs in vocational and adult education. The information gathered suggested problems and needs in several important policy areas. Among them were linkages and training; funding and  legislative priorities; employment concerns; and vocational and adult education facilities, enrollment, services, and programming. In addition, it was found that desegregation and busing often draw the greatest attention of politicians, educators, and citizens, and the provision of educational training services becomes a secondary matter.

The Academic Self-Concept Scale (ASCS) was developed as a measure of academic self-concept in college students. The initial item pool consisted of 59 items worded to conform to a four-pont Likert-type response format. On the basis of responses from 427 college students, the final form of the ASCS was constructed consisting of 40 items with an estimated internal consistency reliability of .91. Validity was established by correlating the ASCS with grade point averages (GPAs) of students and their scores on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. A multiple regression analysis of the ASCS with GPA and Rosenberg scores as predictor variables resulted in a multiple correlation of  .64. These and other data lend support to the reliability and validity of the ASCS as a measure of academic self-concept. (Author)",

Physical exercise has been suggested as an easily administered therapy which does not require close professional supervision. College students (N=18) who had sought professional help for depression participated in a study which compared the effectiveness of counseling therapy and running to counseling therapy alone. Subjects were classified as moderately to severely depressed on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The runners (N=9) ran three times a week for 10 weeks while engaging in therapeutic counseling. Non-runners (N=9) received only therapeutic counseling. Running combined with counseling  therapy produced significantly greater decreases in depression than counseling therapy. The difference between the pre- and post-BDI scores and the counseling-only group was nonsignificant, indicating that the significant main effect for the treatment factor was due primarily to the difference between the pre- and post-BDI scores for the combined running and therapy group.

The model is based on three dimensions of critical importance to primary prevention--prevention type, method, and ecological focus. Units within each dimension are described as interactions which yield classifications of primary prevention strategies and subsequently generate concrete primary prevention interventions. The utility of the model is demonstrated by applying the model to five actual case examples of interventions: (1) a prevention program preparing patients for the stress of surgery; (2) a preventive intervention program for university freshmen; (3) an environmental consultation intervention project  in a university residence hall; (4) a mental health consultation technique used in an Israeli army base; and (5) a workshop aimed at the prevention and management of stress in school personnel. Basic strategies of each case are analyzed by the model and results are used in a discussion of implications for practice and training in counseling psychology. (NRB)",

As the consequences became more negative, subjects employed an increasing number of apology components, i.e., saying they were sorry, expressing remorse, and offering to help the victim. When high consequences and high responsibility coexisted, subjects were most likely to employ self-castigation and directly request  forgiveness. Rsults indicated that as the severity of a predicament increased, so did the use of nonritualized apologies and the number of components employed in apologies. (Author)",

In individual child psychotherapy, the child is seen alone and play therapy is often utilized to help the child become aware of his feelings and express them more appropriately. In conjoint parent-child psychotherapy and counseling, the child is seen together with one parent, usually the mother. The focus may be on the child, the parent, or both. A third form of treatment, parent therapy and counseling, involves one or both parents without the child for therapy or counseling. In some approaches parents are taught therapeutic techniques and child management procedures. The final treatment form is conjoint family therapy in which the entire family is seen. The principal focus is usually on the parents, and  children are often ignored. Each approach has strengths but is incomplete as a treatment mode when used alone. An integration of child and family therapy is recommended which includes approaches which work within the framework of conjoint family therapy, combining techniques of family therapy with play therapy, and other approaches which provide concurrent child and family therapy.

Relevant interview information from 101 sexually active girls was examined for its relationship to timing of first contraceptive use (the length of time between first intercourse and first use of contraception). Six variables explained a  significant portion of the variance in timing of first contraception: belief that pregnancy depends on luck, sister previously pregnant, friend previously pregnant, knowledge about parents' and siblings' contraceptive experiences, conflict about birth control, and reaction to boyfriend's disapproval. Girls who had a feeling of control over pregnancy, whose beliefs and knowledge about birth control were accurate, whose friends and siblings favored birth control and had not been pregnant, and who could solicit and take into account the opinions and beliefs of others contracepted earlier than other girls.

Reciprocal Category Analysis (RCA) is used to measure therapeutic interactions between client and therapist. Three experienced therapists from each of the schools of client-centered, Rational Emotive (RET), Transactional Analysis (TA), and Gestalt therapies submitted 30-minute audiotapes of therapeutic interaction. Fifteen minutes of therapy were randomly selected from each of the 12 tapes and analyzed using Morgan's RCA. Amplification regarding ideas or problems, common to all therapies, was more predominant in Client-centered Therapy. RET, TA and Gestalt used more variety of talk than Client-centered; the sequence of the interactions varied among them. RET had the most verbal  interchanges between therapist and client, and Client-centered the least. Silences were most predominant in Gestalt and almost absent in Client-centered psychotherapy. Interpretations, corrections by the therapist, or client or information exchanges were utilized infrequently by all psychotherapies. (Data do not refer to quality of exchanges but to observable verbal events and sequences of events which occurred in the psychotherapy sessions.) Except for Client-centered therapy, the quantity of the talk did not differ among the psychotherapies; however, the patterns and sequences were different. (Author/NRB)",

There have been large-scale changes in national demographics as the once youthful American population grows older. Progressive declines in birthrates accompanied by greater prospects for longevity make the continuation of the traditional youth orientation in higher education less tenable. Several elements have contributed to a definition of higher education which is less youth-oriented: (1) institutional closings,  (2) the fading of degree program enrollments, (3) a surge in part-time students, (4) the increasing role of non-credit courses, (5) the growth of non-collegiate postsecondary schools, and (6) the changing profile of the learner in higher education. New conceptions of adult development and the substantiation of life-long learning also indicate a need for research regarding the older learner. (Author/NRB)",

To gain insight in dealing with local youth, TRY conducted an investigation of student attitudes at Caprock High School in Amarillo, Texas. One questionnaire was administered to 746 students and a second questionnaire was completed by 64 of the 362 dropouts contacted. Over 70% of the school population was Caucasian, and 25% was Chicano. Chicanos dropped out at a higher rate than Caucasians, girls dropped out more frequently than boys, and most who left did so in the tenth grade. Most students who remained in school reported positive attitudes about their school and felt they would be well-prepared for college or work after graduation. One-fourth of the students  were not involved in school-sponsored activities; dropouts had a very low involvement rate. Over half of the students' parents had graduated; however, Chicano parents had a much lower graduation rate. One-third of the students had a sibling who had dropped out; Chicanos and students whose parents had dropped out were overly represented in this group. Low academic performance was cited as the major reason for leaving school, with family conflict, student pregnancy, and financial problems reported as additional reasons. (NRB)",

        "description":"A cognitive/behavioral model of depression emphasizing the self-control processes of self-monitoring, self-evaluation, and self-reinforcement views self-control as a set of processes by which an individual maintains responses in the relative absence of immediate external reinforcement. The relationship between self-evaluation, attributional style, and clinical depression was examined for 19 depressed and 12 nondepressed psychiatric inpatients and 16 nondepressed nonpsychiatric controls. Subjects were administered a verbal recognition task to assess their self-evaluation patterns. The results offered only partial support for the self-control model of depression. The depressed patients demonstrated lower expectations for their performance prior to undertaking the task, lower  estimations of their performance following the task, and lower levels of satisfaction with their task performance than the nondepressed nonpsychiatric controls. Their performance on these measures, however, was indistinguishable from that of the nondepressed patients, thereby raising questions regarding the specificity of self-evaluation deficits to depression. Results suggest that the validity of conceptualizing clinical depression may be only quantitatively different from mild depression due to the implications of experimentally manipulating success and failure experiences.

Many teenagers are commencing their sexual careers prior to acquisition of the social and cognitive abilities demanded by responsible contraceptive use. A general decision-making framework can be used to create a systematic developmental theory of fertility control. Recent evidence concerning the importance of three psychosocial developments to effective contraceptive use has concentrated on: (1) the acceptance of one's sexuality and fecundity; (2) the acquisition of interactional communication skills; and (3) the development of logical and \"dialectic\" cognitive abilities which permit the individual to systematically anticipate behavioral  consequences and to apply a balance of logic and emotion to personal situations. Delineating the effects of situational characteristics, such as emotional commitment to partner, revealed a relationship between psychosocial development and contraceptive use as well as differences in the use patterns of male- versus female-dependent methods.

Male initiators were perceived more positively than female initiators regardless of type of initiation, and indirect initiations were perceived as more acceptable than direct initiations for both sexes. Male subjects indicated more willingness to engage in both types of initiations than females. There were no sex differences in perceptions.

Defensiveness, in this context, indicates a motive to protect a central component of the self-concept, or a motive to present oneself favorably. Another source of consultee resistance to change results from the limitations of the human cognitive apparatus. Some of these limitations include: (1) the lack of a conscious awareness of higher mental processes; (2) disproportional cognitive availability of vivid events; (3) fundamental attribution error; and (4) other memory-related factors. While the defensiveness hypothesis assigns blame to the consultee for consultation failure, cognitive explanations do not, and tend to lead to changes in consultant behavior designed to  circumvent these limitations.

Similarly, they have glossed over aspects of character to character interaction, such as responses to interpersonal conflict. A children's story survey was conducted to determine the prevalence and distribution of a story's rhetorical elements, to examine the relationship between traditional measures of story complexity and a conflict complexity measure, and to explore relationships that might exist between preference ratings of the stories and the coding of the stories' rhetorical elements. Of the 32 stories  examined, 29 exhibited conflict, especially interpersonal conflict. Inside view was found to be more prevalent in the upper level stories. The results suggest that this model of author/reader interactions and conflict is one step towards a richer language for discussing stories and for enhancing children's understanding of stories.

In the first study, varied aspects of the text and the readers' tasks were examined by monitoring the duration and sequence of readers' eye fixations. The results showed that readers made longer pauses at points of increased processing, such as encoding infrequent words, parsing and representing information in clauses, integrating information from more important clauses, and making inferences. One major outcome of this research was a relatively detailed process model for predicting the gaze duration of college students reading clauses of scientific texts. In the second study, it was hypothesized that individual differences in reading  comprehension were caused by differences in working memory capacity. A test with heavy processing and storage demands was devised to measure the trade-off between reading efficiency and the amount of additional information maintained in working memory. When 20 college students read aloud a series of sentences and then recalled the final word of each sentence, their reading span--the number of final words recalled--varied from two to five. This span correlated with three comprehension measures, including verbal SAT and tests involving fact retrieval and pronominal reference. Similar correlations were obtained with a listening span task, showing that the correlation was not specific to reading. (RL)",

        "description":"This report offers the premise that a psychology of reading instruction has a set of questions of its own, questions that concern the ways in which the environmental interventions called instruction interact with cognitive processes to modify competence. The report discusses two streams of psychological research as they relate to reading instruction: that of the cognitive psychologists and that of the learning psychologists. Sections of the report include discussions of skilled performance and acquisition, individual differences, and inventions and discovery in learning to read. Suggestions for continued study are also offered, and include contrastive studies of good and poor readers, longitudinal studies of reading development, readiness and aptitude matching, and inquiries into  who is likely to invent reading and who seems to need very explict instruction. The report concludes that a great deal more must be learned about the relationship between skilled performance in reading and patterns of acquisition, and that more must be learned about how development is modified by environmental events, particulary instruction.

Several techniques for the study of on-line measurement of comprehension are described that are based on a series of ten stories, each with two versions. The report notes that when subjects were asked to generate interpretations of stories while reading a story line-by-line, they hypothesized about the possible contents of the story and evaluated those hypotheses against the sentences as they read; if they found the new information confirmatory they maintained and further elaborated their hypotheses; and if they found the new information disconfirmatory they eliminated the hypotheses and constructed another consistent with the data. Also, the report notes that reading time  measurements conducted on-line appeared to confirm the theory-generating view. The report concludes (1) that in order to understand the comprehension process a detailed description of the schemata that readers have available as well as an account of the conditions under which certain of these schemata are activated is needed, since there is a tremendous amount of knowledge brought to bear on even the simplest story comprehension task, and (2) that the process of comprehension is very much like the process of constructing a theory.

In addition, the concerns of the new researchers in reading are described, some of the terms they are using are explained, and the implications of their findings for reading instruction are explored. The interests of researchers from fields such as linguistics, psychology, and artificial intelligence are noted in the areas of the relation of reading comprehension to schemata, the differences between spoken and written discourse and the particular difficulties inherent in written discourse, and the uses of questioning strategies. Similarities between the information provided from schema theory as it relates to background information or world knowledge and  common instructional practices such as directed reading activities are noted, as is the usefulness of schema theory as it relates to story grammar in stories commonly read by beginning readers. The study of written discourse is said to provide more information on readability and to point out the need for reading teachers to know more about anaphoric devices. Finally, the paper reviews studies of questioning strategies, cautions about overgeneralizing from isolated research studies with college students, and emphasizes the need for long-term research and more research with children.

A secondary purpose of the study was to determine, through a follow-up interview, the students' ability to induce mental imagery. Sixty-three sixth grade students with above or below average reading ability were randomly assigned to one of two conditions--listen/read or read/listen. The students were met individually for approximately 25 minutes and each was instructed to &quot;make pictures in your head to help you remember&quot; under both listening and reading conditions. Immediately after listening to or reading one of two passages, the subjects responded to questions about their use of mental imagery. Following the interview, the  subjects were asked to retell the passage information and respond to a cued recall test for the passage they had read. Results showed no statistically significant differences between the effects of induced mental imagery for listening and reading for either free or cued recall. The findings did support previous research conclusions suggesting that poor readers suffer from specific comprehension difficulties that do not appear to involve decoding skills. The findings were also consistent with the assumption that listening and reading comprehension depend upon the same basic process. (FL)",

The study was a replication of earlier work that had involved bilingual students. Thirty fourth-grade students were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Those in the first group read the original version of a story, those in the second group read a version that had been rewritten at the sentence level to provide explicit antecedents for 20 obscure pronouns without significantly altering the propositional density of the original, and those in the third group read a version in which trivial propositions that seemed to detract from the predictable structure had been removed. Each student read the story silently  and then retold it. Following the retelling, the student was given a probed recall test designed to assess comprehension of the goal of the story as well as success in identifying obscure pronoun referents. The results showed that the students benefited from story material displaying semantic features of discourse that encourage comprehension as well as decoding ease. These features include a predictable story structure and propositions that are salient because they contribute to rather then detract from comprehension.

        "description":"The past 20 years of research into the efficacy of advance organizers has resulted in little empirical support for their use. A primary reason for this lack of strong support is the absence of true objective descriptions and definitions of the organizers used and the concomitant poor control over their derivation and construction. This deficiency has become particularly serious in the past decade since the popularization and availablility of systems designed to objectify the description of verbal information. The lack of substantively and statistically significant results is not surprising in view of these problems with the past research. Future work on the pedagogical effects of prereading organizers must utilize such available technology in theconstruction and description of  both the text(s) used and the organizers. Due to the number of variables that need to be investigated or controlled in such work (including retention interval, subject area, student ability, student grade level, organizer type, and passage organization), it may be more practical to concentrate research efforts on more direct tests of the basic theory than on one of its pedagogical implications.

The technique also offers a means of discriminating at all points along the reading ability continuum, from young to adult readers. Preliminary research on new miscue analysis shows that it generates more responses for analysis per number of words read than does miscue analysis. By retaining all the features of miscue analysis, the new technique provides a similar \"window on the reading process\" as before--that is, it still  provides classroom teachers with qualitatively useful information--while offering a means of calculating an index of reading progress.

A study synthesized what the lower courts have said about prior restraint and examined how those affected by the rulings have responded. The intent was to identify factors related to levels of awareness and compliance or noncompliance by the affected school personnel. A telephone survey was made of 152 public school principals and newspaper advisers in two federal judicial districts. The two districts were chosen because they had issued contrasting decisions in high school prior restraint cases. The results failed to support the belief that different positions by the federal courts of  appeals account for statistically significant differences in the awareness and noncompliance of principals and advisers. No significant difference was found between the means of principals' and advisers' awareness scores. Awareness was also found to be an unreliable indicator of noncompliance or restraint, especially among principals. Advisers were found to have higher awareness scores if they attended professional meetings at which student rights were discussed and knew of another school with censorship problems. Restraint was more apparent among advisers and principals with no journalism training. (FL)",

The model developed contains three phases: (1) processing or whiting as discovery, including propositionalizing, subchunking, and categorizing; (2) distancing or writing as the establishment of interpersonal relationships including task, subject, and audience; and (3) modelling or writing as the making of texts including genre, time-frame, and discourse organization. Evidence for the validity of the model is provided from studies using three different methods of investigation--rationalism, postivism and contextualism--and six approaches to teaching  composition--genre, subject, situation, sentence, problem solving, and cosmetic. The report concludes that the model satisfies some of the pragmatic requirements of an educational theory: it has implications for instruction, it provides a basis for weighing research methodologies, and it synthesizes research findings from many different fields. The appendix includes the steps of the model with examples of research and classroom practice correlated. (MKM)",

        "description":"Prewriting involves the entire period of time (and necessary activities) which extends between knowing that one is going to write on something and knowing that one has found something specific and substantial to say about it. In classical rhetoric, prewriting is expressed by such terms as &quot;inventio&quot; (whereby the writer discovers ideas to write about) and &quot;topoi&quot; (the general probes or a series of questions one might ask about a subject in order to discover things to say about that subject). An intellectual approach to prewriting depends upon a formal set of questions, the equivalent of classical topoi. The intuitional approach, on the other hand, seeks to generate ideas by forcing the writer to dredge up from the subconscious the impression of the material that is stored there.  There is some confusion of whether prewriting processes should be linear or alinear, sequential of simultaneous, methodically imposed or organically generated. Proponents of the intellectual approach would make the first choice in each instance. However, there is no real order for creativity--it just happens. Teachers of writing can and should come to understand a great deal about composing through careful observation, introspection, contemplation, and reflection. For what teachers of writing need, but have not had, is a reservoir of wisdom and sophistication about writing upon which to draw. (HOD)",

It also suggests that faced with cries for &quot;basics&quot; in education, it should be remembered that nothing is more basic than thinking and that in a balanced curriculum, both kinds of thinking deserve a place. Noting that instruction in linear, logical thinking has long dominated the way writing is taught, the booklet provides a number of activities that involve students in the other kind of thinking as they compose. It argues that such activities can enrich instruction and help teachers reach students who do not  respond with enthusiasm to the grammar lesson, the outline, or the five-paragraph theme.

        "description":"A teacher is likely to encounter three kinds of difficulty with technical writing instruction. The first is transitory difficulty, which a teacher may reasonably expect to overcome with practice. This is the difficulty a teacher may have in learning a new curriculum or the needs of a new group of students, in making up and grading assignments, and in gaining a feel for the technical style. Continuing difficulty is a problem a writing teacher may not expect to overcome, although teachers from other disciplines have. For example, a technical writing teacher may have difficulty evaluating a report from an unfamiliar subject area such as science or engineering, whereas teachers from those disciplines are better able to evaluate the content of such papers. To tell students to write  for the writing teacher is poor teaching, but telling them to produce work that the teacher is likely to misjudge or mishandle is also unwise. This kind of situation lends itself to team evaluation of highly technical papers. The third kind of difficulty is inherent, and is one that no one can overcome. It is the temporary nature of the quality of technical writing and the constantly changing body of technology it represents. (HTH)",

        "description":"A survey of writing was designed to reflect the belief that improving writing instruction depends in part on implementing two principles. These principles are that one must be aware of and sensitive to the sources of language acquisition, and that one must know what students perceive as the major purposes behind their own writing, both present and future. The survey contains three sections in which respondents are asked to indicate the frequency with which they perform a number of activities (viewing, listening, and reading), the kinds of writing done now and expected to be done in the future, and expectations/disappointments of writing instruction. This survey was administered to six distinct groups: (1) 25 nonremedial high school students, (2) 24 developmental college freshman  writing students, (3) 22 students in a regular college freshman composition course, (4) 23 upper-division college students in an advanced writing course, (5) 11 teachers and other professionals in the same geographic area as the surveyed students, and (6) 17 educators at an English teachers conference. The two principal findings from surveying these different groups were that both language acquisition and perceived writing needs were similar for most of the six sampled groups, and that instructors could use this information to improve teaching strategies in writing classes.

        "description":"Summarizing the best current thinking about what classroom approaches produce sound writing experiences in the first eight grades, this book offers teachers a means of checking on their own practices and perceptions about how writing can best be learned. The first chapter of the book presents a historical review of authoritative opinion regarding appropriate instruction in written composition. The recommendations of those authorities are distilled into eleven observations about effective writing instruction, and these observations, in turn, provide the philosophical framework for the remaining chapters. Chapter two cites data gleaned in a random survey of teaching practices in use in fourth grade classrooms, and suggests that while some of the teaching practices utilized are in  concert with those recommended by the authorities cited in chapter one, other practices are in direct conflict with a substantial body of professional literature. Reports of other successful classroom teaching practices and writing programs are detailed in chapters three through six. These chapters discuss the importance of a specific purpose and audience for a piece of writing as well as the necessity of prewriting, rewriting, and evaluating writing. Chapter seven details the trends of writing related research in the past 50 years, the role of the classroom teacher in such research, more recent developments in research practices, and future research needs emphasizing the necessity of conducting writing research in context.

There are three images of intersubjectivity that reflect the dominant ways in which the dichotomy of the individual and the social has been conceived and reconciled: (1) as absolutely separated, independent terms brought together; (2) as terms existing in interaction with one another; (3) or as terms in a hierarchical relation of constitution. Each of these images presents three different ways of asking the question of how communication is possible. Two alternative answers to each of the three forms of the question of communication generate six discrete views within  which the transcendence of the individuality of meaning in communication is accounted for.

In an effort to inform high risk workers and the general public about the health hazards associated with asbestos exposure, HEW produced and distributed public service announcements (PSA) to radio and television networks and distributed packets of information about asbestos to newspapers. Gallup Polls conducted three times during the campaign indicated an increase in public awareness of asbestos dangers. The results of the follow-up of this model PSA campaign suggested the importance of considering the media's role as gatekeeper when assessing the  effectiveness of an information dissemination campaign, particularly the role of print media, which are able to alter information for editorial purposes and may often have sensationalistic priorities for the nature of their coverage of public service topics.

Asante's Afrocentric methodology was used in analysing the rhetoric of Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, writer Toni Morrison, and sociologist Robert Staples on the women's movement. Three conclusions were drawn from this analysis: (1) that the three rhetors noted more differences than similarities between black and white females; (2) that they had varying opinions on whether black females should join with white females in the women's movement; and (3) that they disagreed on whether the impact of feminist rhetoric on the black community was positive or negative. In addition to analyzing messages for content, the three spokespersons were ranked in two major categories--best rhetorical effort and best Afrocentric effort. The analysis indicated that Chisholm ranked higher on  rhetorical effort, probably because she had appeal to broader audiences, while Morrison and Staples ranked equally high on overall Afrocentric efforts.

Pacifica Foundation,&quot; a 1978 case involving a radio broadcast considered to be indecent, was the first United States Supreme Court litigation using the right of privacy, or the right not to hear, as a rationale for broadcast regulation of programing. The issue of pornography best illustrates the judiciary's understanding of the conflict between the right to be heard and the right not to hear. The ruling in the &quot;Pacifica&quot; case maintained that it was not that the content of the indecent speech was not protected, but rather, the manner in which it was presented--over the broadcast media when children might be listening--that strips the presentation of its constitutional right to be heard. However, since broadcasters cannot guarantee that no children will be in a supposedly  adult audience, the right not to hear is not viable justification for reducing an adult listener's freedom through broadcast regulation. Parents and guardians must accept the responsibility for monitoring a child's exposure to broadcast media. (HTH)",

The two instruments were administered to students at a large midwestern university. Responses to the two instruments were submitted to a principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation. The six factors that emerged were: (1) apprehension about public speaking, (2) apprehension about interpersonal communication, (3) preventing others from taking advantage, (4) candidness, (5) contentiousness, and (6) the making of complaints in restaurants. The first factor came exclusively from the Personal Report of Communication  Apprehension, the second factor came from both instruments, and the remaining factors came exclusively from the Rathus Assertiveness Schedule. Since the linkage between assertiveness and apprehension about communication as measured by these instruments appears to be the common factor of apprehension about interpersonal communication, the recommendation of assertiveness training for persons suffering from anxiety in interpersonal situations appears valid.

The author considers political issues that may affect the implementation of educational reform efforts at the federal level, such as homogeneity versus heterogeneity, centralization versus decentralization, constitutional responsibility for education, egalitarianism, types of political structures, and modes of federal governmental influence on schools. He also discusses organizational issues that may affect the implementation of educational innovations at the school level. The paper concludes that policy makers who are concerned that their programs are implemented at the school level must be aware both of federal political factors and of significant, local organizational  factors.

Although neither widely used nor well-defined, individualized instruction is particularly relevant for students who fall outside the norms, behaviorally or academically. It has particular value for ghetto students and delinquent male adolescents. Research indicates that gifted students also benefit from an individualized approach. In most individualized programs, students work at their own paces and pursue objectives based on their unique learning needs. Teachers employ a variety of teaching strategies geared to students' aptitudes and frequently evaluate student progress. Effective leadership from the principal, staff commitment, and upper-level  administrative support are identified as keys to success in individualization. Teachers tend to become more effective with individualization over time. Decentralized management and a centralized curriculum also contribute to a successful program. (Author/WD)",

OCR is criticized for being very slow to issue important guidelines, process complaints, conduct compliance reviews, and enforce the law. Also OCR is charged with showing little commitment to discovering violations or to assisting institutions to prevent them. Further complaints are the inadequacy of training, guidance, and monitoring to assure that policies and procedures determined at headquarters are uniformly implemented in the regions; and the inconsistency of guidelines issued by headquarters. The report recommends that the following steps be taken immediately: (1) Improve OCR's data collection and analysis capacity.  (2) Improve guidance and oversight of regional staff. (3) Implement OCR policy on employment cases. (4) Allocate staff resources necessary to complete planned compliance reviews on schedule. (5) Initiate administrative proceedings to terminate funds in all cases in which voluntary negotiations do not resolve all violations within the specified time limit. (6) Increase cooperation with the Department of Justice (DOJ). (7) Increase Title IX technical assistance and public information efforts. (Author/MLF)",

The authors specifically address eight premises that would increase the role of private schools and seven premises that would decrease their role. Those premises supported by the research findings include the beliefs that private schools produce better cognitive achievement and greater levels of self esteem and fate control among students than do public schools, that private schools provide a safer, more disciplined and ordered environment, that private schools are divisive along religious lines and do not provide as much educational range,  particularly in vocational and nontraditional programs, and that facilitating the use of private schools through tax or school vouchers would decrease racial and economic segregation in private schools. Greater academic demands and a more ordered environment are identified as contributing to higher scholastic achievement in private schools. The report concludes that the research supports policies that would facilitate rather than constrain the use of private schools and that the present constraints on public schools impair their functioning without providing more egalitarian outcomes.

Data were analyzed for each of the following sites: Lake Village, Arkansas; Little Falls, New York; Homer, Alaska; San Antonio, Texas; Logan, Utah; McAllen, Texas; Staten Island, New York; Kenwood, Michigan; and Cache County, Utah. Among findings were that results of the project in Lake Village were positive but not always statistically significant; that fourth grade students in San Antonio reacted well to the TU methods; that in McAllen, the TU group  significantly outperformed the control group on both Flexibility and Originality; and that more students exposed to the TU treatment in Kentwood improved their planning talents than did students not exposed to TU.

A revisionist thesis is discussed in two parts: (1) the conversion of this folk name into a public, ideologically expressive symbol in the 1960's did not achieve its intended purpose of political unification; and (2) in part this failure may be attributed to the unintentional violation of a community's cultural rules for the socially appropriate use of the term, rules keyed on &quot;chicano's&quot; definition as folkloric performance in the generic areas of nicknaming and slurs. Literary, historical, and anecdotal evidence is elicited to support the claim that the term &quot;chicano&quot; affirms cultural identity and that it involves a cultural and not a manifestly  political use of the term. The claim is made on the basis of field-work, anecdotal reports and dialogues, as well as surveys of attitudes toward self-referent terms among Mexican Americans that the folk performance of chicano appears to be governed by certain cultural rules of restriction. One conclusion is that those who would use folkloric aspects of culture should be attentive not only to textual accuracy, but also to such things as context, performance rules, and folk attitudes toward their own folklore.

The test was chosen as an example of a referential communication task that is also a social communication task. The analysis demonstrates that a participant in communication assumes that the other participants are employing strategies for inferring social meaning, and that a failure of two participants' inferences to match results in a \"stumbling\" and a misunderstanding even on the literal, referential level. In the case of the screening test, one result of misunderstandings is that the child's overall score is different from what it would have been had she been more skilled in interpreting the social meaning of talk. A key aspect of processes of conversational inference and  interpersonal coordination is shown to be the timing of interaction. Behavioral means by which communication is socially and rhythmically organized are discussed, with reference to the development of these means as an aspect of child language acquisition. (JB)",

        "description":"The specific concern in this study is to consider the nature, social significance, and consequences of syntactic variation in the question forms used by judges when taking guilty pleas from criminal defendents. Nine judges from a court of general jurisdiction in Arizona were observed and tape-recorded while presiding over several procedures that involve the judge talking a great deal. The particular data presented here involved the change of plea. Generally, it was observed that topics were handled in a variety of syntactic procedures, and that the most legally significant portions varied least. At the same time, there was variation among the judges in their handling of the same procedure. It appears that the choice of question form made by the judge has considerable patterned  and predictable effect on the sequential structure of the discourse that follows. The type of factual basis resulting from one tactic rather than the other may have been quite deliberately intended by the judge, although the choice of one question form over another might have been unconscious. The analysis of these discourse events suggests the possibility of establishing a correlation between syntactic variation in question form with both general social dimensions and dimensions that are specific to the particular institutional context in which individuals are engaged in interaction.

This conversational device is characteristic of a style that seems to grow out of the need to have others approve of one's wants. It is a style characterized here as &quot;high-involvement.&quot; The other three participants exhibited a style which seems to grow out of the need to not be imposed upon, or the need for independence; it is characterized as &quot;high-considerateness.&quot; The &quot;machine-gun question&quot; is spoken at a rapid rate and is timed to come either as an overlap or a latch on the interlocutor's utterance. It also has reduced syntactic form and marked high or low pitch. It requests information, and  it may come in a series. This type of question has its corollary in an answer characterized by reduced form, rapid timing, and marked low or high pitch. Examples of such questions and answers demonstrates the process of perceiving intentions among interlocutors in conversation. A conclusion is that intentions are perceived correctly in proportion to the degree to which conversational style is shared. (AMH)",

The major analysis focused on the total number of correct acting-out responses and the way this score related to several variables. Performance improved with age within the range surveyed, but the rate of growth was not the same from one age period to the next. Children learning the two inflectional languages performed better than did children learning the two word-order languages. The superior performance of the Turkish-speaking children appeared to be related to the fact that Turkish inserts a particle in the verb to carry out this function, while the other languages express the  causative with a periphrastic construction. The similarities and differences in performance growth curves also point to particular aspects of language development in the four languages. For instance, the Serbo-Croatian curve appears indicative of the children's difficulty in attending to both word order and inflectional cues. Continued errors at later ages are evident in both Italian and English, but the linguistic cause in each case is distinctive. In summary, the results suggest that sentence processing is aided by surface markings which identify the roles of particular words. (JB)",

        "description":"The speech of each of eight children aged 15 to 24 months was monitored in an informal setting and analyzed for the imitation of nonsense words introduced by the experimenter. In a second session, objects were introduced as referents for the nonsense words. Results failed to support the two initial hypotheses, namely that children imitate in part because the adult model contains phonological characteristics not yet incorporated in the infant's phonological system; and that a child's imitative utterances reflect phonological characteristics that overestimate the developmental level of the phonological system. The findings indicate that caution should be used in inferring selection patterns from data including imitative utterances, since selection constraints may relax in  spontaneous speech and seem absent in imitation. The apparent relaxation of constraints may be facilitated by the demands of co-occurring developments in the child's lexical and semantic-syntactic acquisition. Children's imitations do not betray the phonological principles of the selection constraints still operating on their spontaneous speech in that they do not include consonants and syllabic shapes absent from the children's spontaneous usage. Exceptions to phonological patterns appear in imitative as well as spontaneous speech. (Author/JB)",

This approach does not work with foreign students because perception, imputation of meaning, and construction of reality appear to be bound by the logic and grammar of the language we speak. The following steps are suggested for teaching expository writing to speakers of other languages in college English courses: (1) show the foreign student how the American English speaker's culture trains readers to react in particular ways to written texts; (2) encourage the students to become aware of differences in expectations in their own culture; and (3) require revisions, that is, rephrasing of sentences or restructuring of paragraphs to  clarify content. It is proposed that the key to the problem lies in the recognition that cultural differences exist in all levels of communication, especially the written text, and that these differences should not be explored in terms of better or worse, but in terms of effective or ineffective for a particular audience in a particular setting.

The trend toward similarities between the two degree programs indicated by the previous surveys has continued at least in the field of higher education. The only major difference concerns the administrative unit: a majority of Ph.D. programs are administered by the graduate college, while the administration of Ed.D. program is administered by the graduate college or the college of education. The length of the two programs are the same, and the lack of a foreign language requirement is common  to both degrees. Statistics and research design are required by more than 80 percent of both programs. Examination requirements are similar, and less than four percent of either program permits deviation from the traditional dissertation. References are included. (SW)",

A sample of 172,400 first-year students over the age of 21 who responded to the Cooperative Institutional Research Program's freshman survey between 1966 and 1978 was compared to a nationally representative sample of traditional-aged students. The analysis considered the following areas: demographics, college choice, the financing of college education, preparation for college, college plans, and life goals. The following demographic characteristics of respondents were considered: enrollment status, age, sex, race, marital status, number of children, and father's and mother's educational attainment. Generally, the greatest  concentration of adults was found in the two-year colleges, particulary those that are publicly controlled. Reasons for the student's selection of the college they attended included the institution's quality, and at times, job-related training and cost. Students' concern for financing their college education was considered in relation to demographic characteristics, field of study, and type of institution attended. The extent of preparation offered in high school, the need for remedial help, high school grade point average, living arrangements while attending college, degree aspirations, probable major, and probable career after college were assessed. Additionally, social, family, business, and personal life goals of respondents were evaluated. Implications of the study findings and  results of additional study of a subsample of the respondents are considered. A bibliography is included. (SW)",

The response rate of the first four surveys was 54 percent or higher: there were 37,800 high school seniors in the class of 1966, 46,500 in 1969, more than 51,500 in 1972, about 50,000 in 1975, and nearly 12,000 in 1980. Overall (total) data for all five classes are presented on: characteristics of high school seniors, including sex, race, course concentration, grade average, and size of community; and characteristics of the head of household, including highest educational level attained. The  plans of high school seniors who plan to continue their education (college choice, field of study, financial arrangements, and school location) are addressed, and comparisons are made between classes. Information is also presented on seniors who plan to delay the continuation of their education for six months or longer after high school graduation, as well as on those who do not plan to enroll in an educational program in the future. In addition to considering seniors' characteristics and plans for each of the five classes, interrelationships of student characteristics and plans by ethnic background and sex are examined for the class of 1980. Appended materials include a sample questionnaire and a list of educational and training programs by degree level. (SW)",

The workbook approach also explains the relationships among the statistics and how those relationships can be used to develop a financial profile. The workbook contains median values that allow statistical comparisons among institutions. After describing the basis for assessing institutional strategies, data sources within the institution and procedures to be used in the financial self-assessment are examined. Worksheets to be used for recording data from  institutional sources are presented. These data are the bases of the calculations in the workbook. Each worksheet covers one statistic and includes a discussion of the statistic's significance, median values for similar institutions, explanation of the calculation, interpretation and limitations of the statistics, and suggestions for further analysis. Four classes of indicators for financial self-assessment, on which the worksheets are based, are as follows: financial resources, flexibility, nonfinancial resources, and changes affecting financial resources. These four categories are further subdivided. Appended materials include calculations for the indicators, a glossary, and information on the steps of developing and testing the workbook. (SW)",

The program was designed to assist faculty and administrators of the Monterrey Institute of Technology strengthen their qualifications through a master's degree program in education offered in Mexico City by regular members of the University of Alabama faculty. Each course and its instructor were assessed using the NCS Student Survey of Course/Instructor, which is appended. Additional questions regarding students' perceptions of their own efforts and the physical arrangements made for the course were added to the instrument. Student outcomes were examined in terms of achievement, written expression in English, and attitudes about their jobs. Pre- and  post-testing of student achievement were undertaken using items submitted by the course instructors, while written expression in English was assessed using pre- and post-course writing samples. A semantic differential instrument, which is appended, was used to evaluate student job attitudes. Additionally, Alabama professors were asked to complete a short questionnaire, which is appended, concerning travel arrangements, housing, local transportation, and course arrangements. Results indicate that instructors and administrators participating in the master's degree program significantly improved in the areas of achievement, written expression in English, and attitude. The courses and instructors were rated good to very good by the students. The arrangements for travel and the courses seemed  to be more than adequate. (SW)",

In the first address on planning, it is suggested that among other problems, institutions have failed to give the appropriate information to  decision-makers and that insufficient attention has been directed to the political considerations in an institution. Catastrophe theory, a method of modeling based on recent theorems in mathematics, is examined in terms of 10 applications. In illustrating the application of catastrophe theory language to institutional research, cost data and teacher performance are addressed. Additionally, it is suggested that challenges of the eighties include bringing Hispanics, blacks, and other low-income groups into the mainstream from which they have been excluded. Contents also include abstracts of contributed papers, seminars, panels, workshops, and meetings; and minutes of the annual business meeting. (SW)",

        "description":"A guide to the instruction of students with disabilities is presented to enhance learning in a college or university setting. Various adjustments that can be made in the environment or in teaching style are suggested. The following categories of disabled students are addressed: blind students, partially sighted students, deaf or hearing-impaired students, students who use wheelchairs, learning disabled students, speech impaired students, students who have had an ostomy, students with spina bifida, students with multiple sclerosis, and students with muscular dystrophy. Specific topics include: the use of readers, brailled books, audio tape recorded books, and recent aids by blind students; test administration to blind students; the use of large print books, a closed-circuit TV  magnifier, and large print typewriter for partially sighted students; the use of sign language, fingerspelling, hearing aids; self-carbon notetaking pads, interpreters, and captioned films by the hearing impaired or deaf; barriers to the student in a wheelchair and the need for a curb cut or ramp; information processing difficulties of the learning disabled student; and types of speech impairments and aids for persons who cannot speak at all. Hints for teachers to facilitate the participation of deaf and hard-of-hearing students in (and out of) the classroom and generalizations about the classroom needs of students who use wheelchairs are presented. A glossary of equipment and other terms, a chart of the American Manual Alphabet and the Braille Alphabet, and a list of resources for  postsecondary educators are among the appendices. (SW)",

        "description":"Preliminary results of the 1979 Doctorate Employment Survey, which is designed to assess the employment experiences of new doctorates in psychology, are briefly described. The survey focuses on employment status, employment settings, and salaries, and is the first survey designed to allow respondents to provide detailed information on their secondary or additional employment positions. A total of 2,154 usable surveys (69.4 percent) was obtained from U.S. and Canada. The employment status of respondents is similar to those obtained in the 1978 survey: the proportion of new doctorates employed full-time is slightly higher in 1979, as is the proportion who are postdoctoral fellows. The employment status for doctorates in various degree fields of psychology is also indicated. With  regard to employment settings, there were 1,729 respondents who were employed full-time: 1,205 were employed at least 35 hours per week in one position, and 379 were employed at least 35 hours in one position and also had a second employment position. The two major full-time employment settings are university psychology departments and community mental health centers or clinics. A majority of those whose primary position is in a hospital, clinic, or other human service setting have their second job in independent practice. Salary statistics for individuals employed at least 35 hours per week in their primary employment are summarized. The highest salaries are found in independent practice and in business, government, and other settings, while the lowest salaries are found in academic  settings. Information is also provided on doctorates employed less than 35 hours per week. (SW)",

Information is presented on the source of the data, sample design, estimation procedure, reliability of the estimates, nonsampling variability, sampling error, and standard errors. Estimates for the SIE were based on data collected from personal interviews from U.S. households. Each state was divided into areas made up of counties and independent cities referred to as primary sampling units. The SIE sample was a stratified multistage cluster design. A ratio estimation procedure was used to correct for coverage deficiencies. Variance parameters for national estimates of college  enrollment/attainment and income are provided for the analysis groups used in the series of reports on the characteristics of postsecondary students. The use of parameters along with a comparison of percentages are illustrated. The standard error for a difference between two sample estimates is also covered.

        "description":"Historical perspectives concerning accreditation in postsecondary education, the structure of accreditation, and possible future roles for the process are examined. It is suggested that the interplay of four groups provides a basis to consider the possible future in the field of accreditation. These groups are: state government responsibilities and activities, specialized academic disciplines and their voluntary national associations, diverse educational institutions and their regional and national associations, and the federal government and its listing or statistical responsibilities. Recent exemplary cooperative arrangements between states and accrediting associations are cited, and it is suggested that these new arrangements point away from a federal role and toward the  future strong role of voluntary, nonprofit accrediting associations. The connotations of concepts such as \"eligibility,\"\"approval,\" and \"accreditation\" are explored, since a recurring problem in the field of accreditation is the use of widely varied terms by associations or agencies. Accreditation is examined historically according to the the following five periods: (1) from the formal establishment of the University of the State of New York as the first accrediting agency in 1787, until 1914, when the Association of American Universities formally listed recognized colleges; (2) from 1914 to 1935, when a more qualitative and less quantitative approach to accreditation was implemented; (3) from 1935 until 1948, when the listing form of accreditation was terminated; (4) from 1948 until  1975; and (5) from 1975 until 1980.

Symmetry in communications is evident in groups characterized by mutual recognition by members of one another as persons accepted and appreciated in their common striving for mutual understanding and consensus. The technique used by the course team is based on informal videotape analysis and group discussion of blockages to communication. Since conflict and misunderstanding may generate disaffection within a group that alienates members and reduces their commitment to the group project, the symmetrical communication process is designed to recognize and counter these dysfunctional tendencies. Videotapes of group meetings are replayed, and whenever a group  member notices some blockage to communication or some constructive contribution, the wideotape is stopped. Individuals involved in the incident are invited to enlarge on their actions or reactions or comment upon the group process. Then wider group discussion begins, and the group attempts to confirm the apparent pattern, find reasons for the blockage, or interpret the group effects of the incident. Where possible and appropriate, strategies for preventing the blockage or overcoming its immediate effects are suggested. Main points emerging from these discussions are recorded as minutes on overhead transparencies when possible, and later photocopied and distributed to participants. Some of the group interaction factors that emerged through this process at Deakin University are identified.  (SW)",

        "description":"The impact of the Supreme Court decision in the National Labor Relations Board v. Yeshiva University case is considered in this literature analysis. This landmark decision held that the full-time faculty members at the private Yeshiva University exercised supervisory and managerial functions and were therefore not entitled to the benefits of collective bargaining under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). The immediate effect of the Supreme Court's ruling on Yeshiva University itself was to suspend, if not terminate, the unionization of the faculty. Although a total of over 20 private colleges and universities have broken off negotiations or refused to bargain with faculty unions, there has not been a widespread movement by college administrations to claim immunity from  collective bargaining under the NLRA. The most likely course for the future is judicial rather than legislative or administrative, and the most likely result of this case-by-case approach is a fairly narrow and gradual application of the Supreme Court's holding in Yeshiva. There is not likely to be very much impact of the decision on public colleges and universities. It is suggested that the significant role of faculty in academic affairs, and their relatively minor influence upon economic matters is congruent with a dual track approach. Under this approach shared authority and faculty senates can be preserved in the academic area, and faculty collective bargaining units are allowed, but the scope of bargaining is strictly limited. The role of the professional literature in the legal  decisions is considered. (SW)",

The results showed an overall positive reaction to the system. Only six percent of the users felt it was hard to learn, although 85 percent wanted more training and documentation. Most users learned from librarians or printed flip-charts; for future improvements, online or computer-assisted  instruction was preferred over audiovisual or group instruction.

An analysis of computer facilities indicated that each individual division of the college had computer systems dedicated to its own needs, which resulted in duplication of equivalent hardware and software. The following alternatives were studied: purchase of a large main frame computer system; development of such a system from the NCR Century 200 System; and development of a distributive computer system which would consist of a number of minicomputers, located in one area or throughout the district, that would be connected with each  other via telephone lines or hand wires. Based on the results of the study, a decentralized approach with physical separation between administrative and educational computer systems was recommended as the overall goal of the district. Specific recommendations for the immediate future involved making major decisions about upgrading the NCR Century 200 System and ways to get maximum advantage from the Data General Eclipse C150, and the purchase of a minicomputer system for administrative functions.
