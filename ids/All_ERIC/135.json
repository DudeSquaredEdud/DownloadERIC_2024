        "author":["Magidson, Errol"],
        "description":"One educational innovation that is receiving national attention is computer assisted instruction (CAI). The PLATO system developed at the University of Illinois (Urbana) is perhaps the most sophisticated CAI system. As with other CAI systems, it permits each student to learn at his own pace; it can provide precise feedback and remedial or advanced work depending on the student's performance; and it can serve as test, text, and tutor. Over the next few years, the Educational Testing Service will be evaluating CAI projects, including the PLATO Project at Kennedy-King College. The implementation strategy used at Kennedy-King will influence the reception of CAI by its faculty and students, and the project's success or failure may help decide the fate of CAI. The preliminary results  of the project indicate that students who have used PLATO find the experience enjoyable and feel that CAI has helped them learn. If technical difficulties are overcome as expected, the PLATO Project will continue to be successful. (Appendixes provide the PLATO Schedule, Students' PLATO Evaluation, and Faculty Questionnaire.)

Additional information to be obtained included the reasons for attending college, graduates' opinions about college curriculum and services, and information about what the graduate was currently engaged in. The survey was mailed to 2,213 1948-1973 graduates of Lake City Community College. A total of 646, or 29 percent, responded. An analysis of the results indicated that of the respondents, 44 percent were AA graduates and 56 percent were AS graduates; 41 percent were employed in jobs related to their LCCC program. Responses  indicated that the students came to LCCC because if offered them what they wanted in terms of courses, programs, and general reputation. Graduates were strongly positive in their ratings of the teaching, library, bookstore, admissions, registration, and scheduling. The graduates worked between 11 and 20 hours per week while in college, and 75 percent received financial assistance. Little help was reported by graduates in finding a job or in transferring to another institution; the best help came from faculty members. Special help for students was suggested in the areas of doing research, writing term papers, course selection, program selection, scheduling classes, and finding jobs. Sixty percent of the graduates continued their education after LCCC, with 43 percent earning degrees. A  total of 95 percent fully recommended LCCC. (DB)",

        "description":"The purpose of this investigation was to identify those demographic and programmatic (independent) variables which were the best predictors of student success in a remedial program, as measured by four different criterion (dependent) variables: grade point average, persistence, increase in internality in locus of control, and increase in self-concept. The demographic variables examined were age, sex, yearly family income, curriculum aspiration, and ethnic background. The programmatic variables isolated were individualized instruction, integrated vocational learning experiences, program focus on self-concept development, and volunteer instructors. In order to capture the programmatic variance unaccounted for by these selected variables, the program itself was regarded as a  variable. The four programmatic variables examined were so highly correlated that individually they showed no significance. Together, however, they contributed a significant amount of variance in student GPA and changes in locus of control. Moreover, the only significant predictor of persistence was the remedial program which contained the most (three) program variables. Unidentified variables were operating in addition to the four specified to create this effect. No variables were found to be predictive of self-concept. Clearly, existing education technology is sufficiently powerful to enable high-risk students to succeed in postsecondary remedial programs. (Author/DB)",

Results of the study indicated that: (1) approximately 95 percent of the graduates were either single females (40.9 percent) or married females (54.5 percent); (2) approximately 73 percent of the students were 25 years or older; (3) VWCC GPA's correlated  significantly with all subtest scores; (4) high school rank, high school Algebra 1, and age correlated significantly only with certain subtest scores; (5) no significant correlations were found between high school chemistry grades and subtest scores; and (6) 81 percent of the variance between subtest scores and student characteristics/achievement variables can be explained by canonical variable 1. These results supported the present screening and selection procedures with the recommendation that the use of high school chemistry grades as a criterion for admission be reviewed. (Author/DB)",

The actual programs of the students placed, but not registered, in these remedial courses are examined. A total of 2,916 students were placed in remedial English, reading, and mathematics Curriculum, and 3,487 were enrolled in the same curricula. In comparison with remedial placements in the fall of 1971, the proportion of remedial English-reading placements in the fall of 1974 was noticeably higher, whereas the proportion of remedial mathematics placements was markedly lower. Forty-seven percent of the students were actually enrolled in one of  the remedial English/reading courses, as compared with 74 percent placed, and 32 percent were enrolled in a remedial mathematics course, as compared with 37 percent placed. There was a marked increase in the proportion of nursing students that required remediation in reading/writing as well as in mathematics. An estimated 600 to 700 students placed in remedial courses were found to be taking college-level courses and were not enrolled in the remedial courses. Since 1971, the proportion of students recommended to the college by the University Applications Center with high school English averages below 70 percent has remained constant, whereas those with high school mathematics averages below 70 percent has steadily declined. There is a noticeable discrepancy between the proportion of  students with mathematics averages below 70 percent and the proportion of students in remedial mathematics courses. (DB)",

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is the presentation of a proposal for a year-round operation and an annual assignment system (YRO/AAS) to the administrative officers of the College of DuPage, Glen Ellyn, Illinois. The proposal is comprised of four chapters. The first chapter deals with the significance of the study in terms of the College of DuPage's administration phasing out four-quarter contracts and demoralizing the faculty in the process. It then attempts to show how an all-college annual assignment would give the institution a year-round operation. It defines its terms through a literature search, and looks at other schools that are attempting a year-round operation. Chapter 2 investigates the administrative science theory for a rationale and philosophy for a year-round operation  or an annual assignment system. It looks at management theory in the hope of bettering the morale and work climate of the institution. Chapter 3 provides the proof that the college can put the faculty of Omega College, a unit of the College of DuPage, on an annual assignment system at no extra cost to the institution. Omega College could then operate on a year-round basis. Chapter 4 develops an internal governance model and an operational scheme for such a program. It attempts to show how the year-round operation/annual assignment system follows the basic mission purpose of the institution. (Author/DB)",

The replies showed that 87.5 percent screen applicants, 90.6 percent interview, and 68 percent require references. Less than one-third of the schools feel that previous nursing experience is beneficial. Only 9.38 percent use the A.C.T. as a preadmission test; 85 percent consider high school grades important;  and 53 percent consider class rank as predictive of success. I.Q. is a criterion for 34 percent. Accepting students with advanced standing is effected by proficiency testing. Eleven schools rely on a single preadmission test, although 24 different tests are administered in the 32 schools. (Author/DB)",

(2) \"Legal, Institutional, and Moral Rights\" gives specific definitions and examples of these various kinds of rights, concentrating on the academic context. (3) \"Guidelines for Administrative Decisions Concerning Students\" suggests considering alternative models of student-institutional relationships, developing a campus judiciary  system, setting up a list of policy areas to be developed that affect basic rights, preparing for greater involvement with the courts, and improving skills for managing and utilizing conflicts.

From a final sample of 1,240 these student characteristics were gathered: graduate status on leaving, sex, ethnic group, full- or part-time enrollment, and BCC curriculum area. This personal data is tabulated against the responses to the questionnaire which emphasizes reasons for leaving BCC, post BCC academic status and experience, job experience and relevance of BCC studies to employment. Two important reasons for leaving before graduation were financial need and intention to continue education. Most BCC graduates continue their education immediately, while nongraduates at  least plan to do so. Nongraduates who sought jobs had more difficulty finding jobs than graduates, and their salaries on full-time jobs were inferior. The survey includes student recommendations for changes in, or additions to, the BCC program. (MJK)",

The current Secretarial Careers Program emphasizes preparations for the Certified Professional Secretary (CPS) examination. The high percentage of students obtaining employment prior to the completion of the two-year program raised a question as to whether employers wanted and were willing to pay for office staff with the skills of a CPS. Data indicated 75 percent were not  familiar with the term at all. Two recommendations were made: (1) to begin to plan for the development of a shortened program, and (2) to make employers more aware of the skills of a Certified Professional Secretary.

Among the developmental courses offered (English, reading, mathematics, and social science) reading was found to be the most expensive. Most of the cost, nearly 70 percent, was directly attributable to instruction. All of these developmental courses operated at a deficit; that is, their costs were greater than the funds received via state funding and student tuition. The high cost of these courses emphasizes the need for additional funding if the Florida community colleges are to meet the needs of the significant number of students having remedial deficiencies.

Options have increased particularly in the area of career programs. The present report shows how students are taking advantage of these program alternatives. Growth programs are identified, and program completion patterns according to sex are reviewed and analyzed. The detail of growth for individual major fields reveals that a few programs in particular were sources of growth. Nursing graduated 21 students in 1970 and 132 students in 1974. In the transfer area, the large growth field was general studies, graduating 60 students in 1970 and 179 students in 1974. General studies thus accounted for most of the growth in transfer graduations, although art  and music were also showing strong growth as small programs.

The paper discusses: (1) general objectives in a regular course offering in the Jewish religious heritage; (2) lectures, assignments, a 133 item bibliography on American Jewry, and possible outside reading for a thematic class entitled The Jew in America; (3) possible written  assignments which might include a book or article review, a personal journal, or &quot;synthesizing project&quot;; (4) examples of role-playing, problem-solving, and games; (5) uses of multimedia resources; and (6) instructional uses of the photographic essay. The appendix is a listing of the producers and distributors of Jewish audiovisual material. (Author/MJK)",

This model establishes a vehicle for learning experiences for physicians, trustees, and administrators in selected hospitals to assist them in the development of three-year operational plans required by Federal legislation. Significant health, social service, and higher education legislation passed since 1920 was reviewed to determine its primary and/or secondary impact on health manpower teaching programs in institutions of higher learning. This report recommends that the health planning organization, the hospital association, and the university collectively plan to meet  identified community needs as they relate to comprehensive three-year operational organizational plans.

These output goals may be classified in two categories, quantitative (numbers of graduates, grade point averages, etc.) and qualitative (knowledge, skills, personal growth). In education, the input-process-output model has limitations and must be used with care to avoid mechanistic approaches. A sensitive feedback system utilizing followup studies is needed to continually refine goals. Colleges' first priority should be growth in people: developing human potential, decision-making skills, and recognizing the values of individualism. A  second priority is the acquisition of knowledge. This implies the need to analyze curriculum and its applicability to real decision-making situations so that knowledge is relevant. The third priority is the development of skills, requiring first the development of efficacious teaching methods. (MJK)",

The population analysis considers such characteristics as age, race, foreign origin, labor force status, educational level, income level, and college enrollment figures. Specific projections are made for Lakeland. The community was surveyed to determine opinions on Florida's growth. The projected doubling of population by 1980 and the increasing educational demand of the  community indicate a definite need for a second campus in Lakeland.

A model of student flow is described in terms of progress toward graduation, based on records of sources of students, freshmen and sophomore flows, and graduation patterns over five years. Over this period the percent increase in the number of graduations was greater than the percent increase in the number of sophomores, while the percent increase in the number of sophomores was greater than the percent increase in the number of freshmen. Students continuing college work increased in the &quot;pipeline&quot; at three times the rate of first-time collegians. An application of the model to the class of  1970 revealed that three times as many students went &quot;straight through&quot; as those who were &quot;in and out,&quot; 60 percent of the &quot;stop-outs&quot; interrupted their studies for only one semester, and only one student out of four tried college briefly and dropped out. The evidence also suggests that as many students transferred before graduation as graduated. (Author/BB)",

Since most adult students are dropouts or failures from traditional learning situations, a system was developed which utilizes educational technology to obtain better learning outcomes. Performance objectives define exactly what the student must perform, describe the conditions for performance, and provide the standard of acceptable performance. Objectives are either purchased or designed by the faculty, and are often used in combination. The important key to individualization is the use of cognitive style mapping which gives a picture of how each student perceives, seeks meaning, and obtains information from his  environment and personal experience. Through cognitive style mapping, students are routed to educational programs that are built on their cognitive style strengths. To evaluate student progress, continuous spot checking through a computer based, criterion-referenced longitudinal testing program is used. This Comprehensive Achievement Monitoring model, primarily a management tool for the instructor, will provide pretest, posttest, trend and learning retention data as well as an automatic system for validating objectives.

A tough negotiating team should be set up to allow the optimum freedom and power to the board. In-house personnel such as noninstructional administrators are preferable as negotiators to outside representatives, but no trustee or president should be a member of the team. During negotiations,  economics should be discussed after all other demands are settled; as few provisions as possible should be allowed. Union recognition and management rights clauses, a \"zipper\" clause (disallowing previous benefits not specifically renegotiated), and a grievance procedure should always be included.

Identical questionnaires were sent to the 65 cafeteria workers and 21 degree candidates. Of the 45 responding workers, most had entered school cafeteria work because of previous experience, inner motivation, or the good working hours. A majority had supervisory responsibility, had held their current position five years or more, and were paid below $5,000 annually. Whereas most of these school workers were middle-aged females, 10 of the 14 responding A.A. degree candidates  were young (21-25) males. Most were employed in institutions other than schools and were less experienced and better paid than school workers. Both the workers and the degree candidates found their courses useful in providing skills for advancement. They suggested a broader variety of courses, especially for the school lunch programs. The avocational students, in a separate survey, indicated an interest in more variety beyond the Modern Buffet, Foreign Foods, and Wines courses now available. They suggested that more avocational courses be taught in the evening. (MJK)",

The one reason chosen most often (28 percent) seemed to be scheduling conflicts with work, other classes, or other duties. The second ranking category included a series of academic reasons; 19 percent said they were making less than a passing grade. The third  major reason was the cancellation or splitting of classes. The distribution of withdrawals over the quarter was skewed at the extremes, with 78 percent of all drops occurring during either the first or last weeks.

Following Osgood's Semantic Differential technique for surveying in the affective domain, it was found that there was no significant differences among the constituent bodies in any of the oriented activities, evaluation or potency modes. Indeed, there was a high degree of correlation among all the constituent groups' attitudes toward this participative governance system. Although the theoretical structure of the Institutional Governance system would appear to be an almost ideal model for  collective input and decision making because of broad representation and two-way communication channels, it is still felt by all constituent groups to be aggravating, complex, and slow. It is therefore recommended that the governance system at Delaware County Community College be streamlined in both size and efficiency, that feedback on recommendations be more continuous, and that viable committee decisions be implemented more expediently.

While equitable workloads can be det4rmined in most other fields because credit hours coincide with an instructor's time in class, the physical education staff often spends more than twice the number of hours in class than credit hours reflect, apart from athletic coaching hours. A review of other Florida community college workload systems was undertaken, and Miami-Dade Junior College's system was found most equitable. This system assigns points for teaching, preparation, and administrative time. Still, the heavy load of \"activity\" courses with low credit allowances penalizes  physical education staff. One solution was to determine \"productivity\" by calculating the actual student semester hours produced by the department. This calculation revealed that departmental workload had increased 20 percent over the previous year, while the instructional staff had been cut from six to five. On this basis, recommendations were made to the Board of Trustees to hire part-time help, to pay coaches supplemental salary for coaching athletic teams, and to reduce workloads to bring them in line with those of other instructional staff.

Teaching, which includes classroom instruction, preparation, student evaluation, professional growth, and informal contact with students, is used as the base activity for the point system. A value of one point is assigned to 10 contact hours before a group of students. The assumption is that two hours away from the group of students is required for each contact hour. Counselling and library work are equated to teaching, and a list of activities called \"other contracted assignments\"  are also equated to teaching by assigning point values to them. Values for research, curriculum development, committee work, travel, conference attendance, peer evaluation, and other faculty duties are enumerated. (Author/MJK)",

The systems approach is used to solve educational problems through a process of analysis, synthesis, modeling, and simulation, based on the LOGOS (Language for Optimizing Graphically Ordered Systems) language and process of &quot;anasynthesis&quot; developed by Dr. Leonard Silvern. An added long range goal is quantification, whereby models can be used to answer questions regarding cost benefit, cost utility, and cost effectiveness. Computer Managed Instruction permits the educational technologist to utilize the computer in managing the complex information required in an individualized and personalized instructional  program. Inputs to the system include such variables as pretests, posttests, criterion-referenced measurement, preferred modes of instruction, performance objectives, cognitive styles of program participants, tracking and evaluation of student progress, and measurement of retention. The process of change to such a program is discussed with relation to cost, strategy for change, use of computer systems, and the change agent. Flow charts depicting the program model are appended.

Data were collected from 20 randomly selected kindergarten classes in ten schools and ten prekindergarten classes in six schools through the use of classroom observation and questionnaires given to school personnel, teachers, principals, and supervisors. No control groups were used. Study objectives were to determine the extent to which the expanded prekindergarten and kindergarten programs (a) provided opportunities for skill development and the environment to succeed necessary to assure later progress in school; (b) provided a program for identifying physical and emotional health needs  of the disadvantaged child; and (c) developed interest and participation of parents and community leaders. It was found that, in the context of the demands of compensatory education, both programs provided opportunities for intellectual and experiential stimulation, but there was little assurance that such opportunities were being used to the best advantage. Recommendations for improvement of the curricula and quality of instruction through carefully structured inservice training and suggestions for further research are made.

These same theories were described earlier by John Locke and Immanuel Kant, and were the basis of the new &quot;Humanism&quot; movement in Germany in the 18th century. If one considers humanistic psychology as a kind of culmination of the &quot;centralist and holistic&quot; schools of psychology up to the present time, it becomes clearly evident that Piaget fits squarely into this intellectual tradition. Both Piaget and humanistic psychology hold a number of underlying principles in common: (1) the feelings of people and the affect qualities are raised to the highest level; (2) the focus of human activity is on purpose; (3) learning must lead to personal growth; and, (4) the spontaneity  and play spirit of the child is emphasized.

In the experiment described the authors sought to assess the developmental changes in the child's ability to infer and remember different kinds of linguistic information with children in grades K through five. Six paragraphs were read to each child; after each of these they were asked 8 Yes/No questions. Four questions were of verbatim information and four were of the different linguistic inferences being studied (presuppositions, inferred consequences, semantic  entailment, and implied instruments). Age-related improvements were found for the verbatim information and for the spontaneous processing of implicit information, as well.

Preliminary analyses were conducted to identify similarities between child and adult value structures. Subjects were 226 sixth and seventh grade children and 137 adults from the Austin, Texas metropolitan area. The four influences of sex of respondent, occupation of adult respondent, or head of household (children), race, and religion were chosen because of earlier studies indicating their influence on values. The four variables were  examined using the same subjects and methods involved in the preliminary analyses. Results of the study indicated that children and adults generally hold different values and that these values are influenced by different sources. For adults, only race was a notable influence, affecting values pertaining to allegiance to God and country. Evidence indicated that the values of children are more easily influenced by the variables; in over half of the significant findings, differences in sex, race, and religion occurred in the extent to which children valued their independence.

Schools are not able to make up for a child's deficiencies in experience which evolve from his home life during the preschool years. Three small programs which increased parent involvement are described and the results given: (1) a program of educational games designed to help parents teach age-appropriate concepts to preschoolers; (2) a program of learning games for economically disadvantaged parents to use with their second grade children to increase their reading achievement; and  (3) a program in San Francisco in which parents of children threatened with expulsion became active observers and learning helpers in their children's classrooms. It was found that these working programs provided regular interaction between parent and child, evoked greater encouragement and approval from the parent, and increased parental interest in his/her child's abilities and progress. On the basis of these findings a model elementary school program is proposed in which an intermediary teacher teaches parents methods of helping children learn to read. (Author/ED)",

Presented are four major factors that have exerted pressure on the schools to change from a developmental to an academic approach in preschool education: (1) the wave of adverse criticism of American education and advocation of reactionary formal instruction set off by the launching of the Sputnik satellite; (2) the new interest and consequent research in the early learning/teaching process by scientists; (3) the influence of learning theories and the use of behavior modification and motivation techniques in preschool education; (4) the national awareness of the problems of the disadvantaged. These factors encouraged an approach  towards education neglectful of humanistic, self-fulfilling goals, resulting in a trend toward formal early education that may involve some risks to the child's development. Several examples of practices that may constitute too much pressure on the child at the preschool level are given along with examples of possible child reactions. (SDH)",

The background theory which is presented is developmental in perspective. The interactionist viewpoint, an important aspect of the theory, states that development is jointly determined by the interaction of internal and external factors. Two conceptual schemes of the stages of moral development are presented as formulated by Piaget and Kohlberg. A theoretical model is described and explained as it relates to the moral education programming used in the study. Two general educational approaches were employed: (1) mini-courses on values issues in which the determination of course content and structure  revolved around teacher and student learning, and (2) an &quot;event&quot; approach in which the researchers provided a variety of learning activities based on evidence of the students' stage of development. Pre- and posttests used to determine the stage at which each child was thinking were analyzed statistically. The results, presented in table form, are discussed in terms of the stages of moral development. (SDH)",

Researchers have speculated that the cause of this phenomena may be a lack of continuity between the child's early education experiences and his subsequent experiences in school. Based on a review of recent research, this paper explores home/school continuity (the degree of similarity between the child's experiences at home and at school) and preschool/school continuity (the degree to which the transition periods of different expectations is made smooth). The different approaches to parent involvement in the home/school transition examined include home intervention (home visits, parent meetings, etc.), the use of parents as  paraprofessionals, and bicultural/bilingual education programs as an example of making school more like home. The preschool/school transition is discussed in terms of the different expectations to which a child must respond, including the child's adjustment to new rules of behavior, new peers, new teachers, and the demands of different instructional approaches. Questions raised in this paper suggest that continuity may be important, but that further and more rigorous research is necessary to determine the best methods of promoting continuity. (Authors/ED)",

Studies that have implications for educational practice were selected for review. The first part of the paper is concerned with the influence of enduring personal characteristics on peer relations. Some of the stereotypes that affect children's friendships include a child's name, physical appearance, race and sex. The second section reviews research on the influence of school environment on friendships. Classroom and school situation variables covered include population mobility, opportunities to participate in school activities, the kind of classroom activities that occur, and the opportunities to succeed. The third section examines research on the kinds of social skills important in  achieving peer acceptance (responsive to peers, effective communication, expertise in school activities, know-how in building a relationship). The paper concludes with a discussion of ways in which children can be taught appropriate social skills for making friends. Teaching methods which include shaping, modeling, and coaching have been found effective with socially isolated children. (Author/ED)",

The specific problem assessed was the relative influence of academic and practicum training on developing behavior modification skills in parents who work with their own psychotic and mentally retarded children. Three parents were taught reinforcement, shaping, and stimulus control principles and their applications in an academic program, and then were &quot;shaped&quot; to carry out self-help, language, and social-recreational skill training procedures with their children. The main findings were that academic training influenced academic performance but had little influence on practicum performance. Practicum training was the primary factor influencing practicum  performance, and seeing a movie of someone else training was not as effective as tutoring (or shaping) for developing criterion level behavior shaping performance in parents.

        "description":"The purpose of this study of social development was to begin to assess the effects of an early, continuing group educational/child care experience on basically family-reared children. Two experimental groups and one control group of young children were involved. In the \"long-term\" experimental group, five children (mean C.A.=16 months) met one afternoon per week in a home setting under the care of a paraprofessional. In the \"intensive\" experimental group, five other children (mean C.A.=25 months) met three afternoons per week under the care of a professional preschool teacher and one paraprofessional aide. At 34 months, 8 of these 10 children entered the same nursery class with control children. At 40 months, data on all these children were collected according to a Social  Participation Scale (noting type of play, conversations, response to peer and adult approaches, expressions of hostility, etc.). Results suggest that the subjects with early educational experiences exhibited more advanced social behavior than the control subjects, and that \"long-term\" program subjects exhibited more advances in social behavior than \"intensive\" program subjects. Findings suggest that (1) paraprofessionals can be effective in early education programs; (2) home settings can be functional environments for such programs; and (3) early educational contacts need not be massive to produce results.

Originally, the Mother's Day Out program offered a few hours of child care to mothers of preschool children for a very small fee. However, it became apparent during the early phases of operation that many of the preschool children needed more help than the program teacher could promise. The services of a psychologist-consultant were employed, to help evaluate the children, to assess the relationship between the teacher, aide (a volunteer mother), and the children, and to provide direct consultation to parents in discussion groups. Also, a referral process involving a community Evaluation Team was instituted. The procedures and  problems involved in establishing the Mother's Day Out program are described; plans for future changes in the program are also presented. Important among these changes is the evaluation program which will involve the input of the psychologist, teacher, and parent. Concluding discussion focuses on the evolving role of the psychologist-consultant. (SDH)",

In addition, the heights and weights of 81 parents and 34 older brothers were measured. The major hypothesis of the project regarding physical, mental, and health deficiencies was that there would be wide and significant differences between middle class and underprivileged in the following variables: height and other linear measures, weight and other mass measures, some physical function tests,  health variables, skeletal maturity, performance on intelligence tests, and other aspects of physical development. These differences were then related to the following variables: nutrition, overcrowding and/or number of children in family, type of housing, general hygiene including medical care, education and general socioeconomic level of parents, and intrafamily relationships and family stimulation. Other areas of interest were comparable studies of Tunisian, American, and Italian middle class differences in nutrition \"practices,\" and in examination of the effects of \"positive stimulus\" by economic and social development on the families of poorer classes.

Results indicated a fairly high level of success at termination on the basis of parent-collected observational data, parent attitude change toward their children, and parent attitude concerning the process and outcome of treatment. Modest levels of success were evidenced on the basis of behavioral data recorded by trained observers in the home. Families who participated in followup demonstrated greater cooperation and involvement with the treatment program than those who did not participate.  In all other respects, however, these two groups were similar. Followup data on parent attitude measures demonstrated maintenance of the treatment effects. Parent observational data were incomplete but also showed maintenance in followup. For the subsample of 14 cases, home observation records indicated a nonsignificant decline in deviant behavior at termination followed by a nonsignificant but systematic increase in deviant behavior during followup.

During the subsequent 2 years, continuing data will be collected for a first and fourth grade cohort. Thus, in a 3-year period a picture of growth during the initial 6 years of schooling will be obtained. Various aspects of the longitudinal study which are discussed in some detail in this research  design are: assessment of variables, testing instruments, sampling plan, testing sequence, testing schedule, migrating children, and plans for data analysis.

        "description":"This paper traces the development of interpersonal skills and characterizes the essential features of social interaction as they change from infancy to adolescence. It is demonstrated that, at each life stage, the quality of social relationships is dependent on the person's capacity for interpersonal closeness, his ability to use language, and his cognitive maturity. The developments of the six life stages are discussed. During infancy, rudimentary social skills and an underlying sense of being emotionally connected with people are established. The expressiveness or retentiveness of speech and a general level of abstractness of speech are dominant characteristics of toddlerhood. Egocentrism decreases and language skills increase in significance during early school age. Middle  school age brings an awareness of behavior norms and an increasing capacity for compromise. During early adolescence, an upsurge in egocentric concern is evident in regard to self-presentation; cognitively, there is a growth in conceptual skills characterized by the development of formal thought. Finally, in late adolescence, the individual's personality is consolidated enough to produce an integrated interpersonal style which communicates basic personal needs and social attitudes. (SDH)",

        "description":"This report presents outcome data on five referrals for child-family intervention in which a new system for obtaining audio-recorded behavioral data was employed as one of several evaluation criteria. The referred child was asked to wear a radio transmitter during most of his waking hours at home during pre-intervention and termination assessments. The transmitter broadcast to a receiver-recording apparatus in the home which could be activated by an interval timer at predetermined \"random\" times or by parents predetermined \"picked\" times when the children were said to typically exhibit problematic behavior. During the project, treatment involved an educational program with the parents in which they were trained to keep data on their child's behavior and to institute behavioral  programs to change those behaviors. Results are discussed in terms of the frequency of occurrence of child deviant, parent negative, and parent commanding behaviors. In general, the behavioral outcome data verified that from the two other sources (parent attitude reports and parent collected observation data). It was concluded that the audiorecording procedures provide a viable alternative to employing an observer in the home. (Author/SDH)",

Subjects were 28 families with children between 4 and 8 years of age who had been referred to a clinic for acting-out behavior and 28 nonreferred controls matched on several variables. Home observation results indicated that referred children showed significantly more deviant behavior and less prosocial behavior while their parents emitted more negative and commanding behavior than control group parents. Systematic observation in the clinic revealed significant differences only in parent negativeness and number of commands. Finally, all five factors of the parent attitude questionnaire yielded large and  significant differences between groups. There was considerable overlap between groups on all behavior variables but less overlap on the parent attitude measure. Results from a stepwise discriminant analysis classified 90 percent of referred children and 90 percent of nonreferred children correctly on the basis of the parent attitude variable alone. Taken together, these results suggest that child behavior is not always the critical variable in referral and stress the importance of multiple assessment of child-family problems when children are referred for treatment.

The results indicated that, in general, a higher percentage of assignments was completed when the number of days between point exchanges was variable, and that performance was maintained when the number of school days between point exchanges was gradually increased. The overall accuracy on assignments was high, but variable and did not appear to be under the systematic control of the experimental procedures. Data for two selected pupils indicated that there were individual differences as to the effects of the various token (point) exchange procedures. Thus, the variable  sequencing of the number of days should be an important consideration in any effort to maintain the positive effects of token-reinforcement systems within classroom settings.

Results of the third project year as well as a comparison between other project years and a general summation of achievement of program objectives are presented. Students, as a whole, showed growth both in cognitive and affective areas of development. The parents showed increasing positive modes of perceiving and interacting with their children; they also exhibited growth in using appropriate teaching techniques. Likewise, the teachers showed increases in their knowledge of child development, in the use of appropriate teaching techniques, and in establishing positive relationships with parents and  children. Specific cognitive, social, emotional, and physical objectives for each of the program's components (the child, the parent, the staff, the handicapped, and the management process) are presented, analyzed statistically, and evaluated. Approximately one-half of the document consists of statistical information. (SDH)",

The evaluation of the project during its first year focused on 42 different product and process objectives and was concerned with the project's impact on children, parents, and staff. The program's goal was to provide a close home-school continuum to reinforce the development of skills that will facilitate later learning: language skills, hand-eye coordination, math and science concepts, auditory and visual discrimination, gross motor skills, the creative arts, as well as social growth. The results, which have been statistically analyzed in the report, clearly indicate that the Saturday School  program has been effective with students, parents, and teachers: (1) the students have shown growth in both cognitive and affective areas; (2) the parents have shown increasingly positive modes of perceiving and interacting with their children; and (3) the teachers were found to have increased use of appropriate teaching techniques and interacted more positively with both children and parents.

These projects have led to the creation of schools, the continuous extension of grades, and the creation of &quot;Concentraciones de Desarrollo Rural.&quot; They seek to: (1) provide every child with the opportunity to study until the ninth grade; (2) provide adequate education to children and adults; and (3) improve the living conditions of the rural milieu. These projects require a series of changes--adapting plans and programs to regional and national necessities, providing better trained teachers, and strengthening community development programs. This bulletin describes the educational experiences which  have been accomplished in the municipalities of Alpujarra, Dolores, and Trujillo. The objectives, methods, and techniques used in their planning, and their organization are discussed.

Public Schools visited the Environmental Outdoor Laboratory School, Catoctin Mountain National Park, Thurmont, Maryland. The school provided: (1) specialized training in reading and related communication skills; (2) opportunities for growth in socialization through resident experiences; (3) recreational experiences available only in an outdoor camp setting; and (4) utilization of mathematics, science, and social studies in on-site experiences to extend and clarify classroom experiences. A survey was conducted to assess the project's effectiveness and determine the importance of such a project on urban students. Interviews and questionnaires were used to gather data from the staff, visiting  teachers, parents, and students. Pre-post attitude and knowledge questionnaires were administered to students during the program's first, fifth, and eighth weeks. Some findings were: (1) positive results existed on both students' attitudes and knowledge inventories; (2) there was an overall gain in knowledge in mathematics, science, and vocabulary; (3) camp staff members rated the total program &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;good&quot;; and (4) classroom teachers felt the program contributed to the students' social growth as they experienced the responsibilities and social interchange of group living. The report's appendixes give examples of the survey instruments used, a schedule of a typical day, and lists of participating schools, personnel, and resident and visiting teachers. (NQ)",

        "description":"The four periods discussed in this publication cover the patterns of Spanish emigration to the New World, mainly on the regional level and in terms of percentages. The effects of this emigration on the various Spanish American dialects are discussed. In the initial period (1493-1519), the largest single group, in every year and on all major expeditions, were the Andalusians, of whom over 78 percent came from the two provinces of Sevilla (58 percent) and Huelva (20 percent). In the second period (1520-1539), the conquests on the mainland greatly increased the number of destinations the emigrant could elect. During this period, Mexico failed in only one year (1527) to attract over 50 percent of the emigrants. A chain of 4 provinces (Sevilla, Badajoz, Caceres, Toledo, Salamanca, and  Valladolid) accounted for slightly over half of all emigrants to the New World, with Seville furnishing one out of every six men and half of all the women. In later periods (1540-1559 and 1560-1579), there was a sharp reduction in the proportional emigration to Santo Domingo, Central America, and the Rio de la Plata; Mexico, Peru, Chile, and the Nuevo Reino de Granada were emerging as almost invariable destinations. Between 1560 and 1579, roughly three out of every four emigrants came from the southern half of the Peninsula and 28.5 percent were women. (NQ)",

Two experts were employed to design the research of several programs (such as the 3-year Child Study Program, designed to  evaluate student and teacher attitudes) and to tabulate resulting data, while other experiences were evaluated subjectively. Tentative rationale for developing a community mental health program was effected by the Consulting Psychiatrist. Conceived as a workable &quot;blue print&quot; for rural communities concerned with developing mental health programs based on the Lewis County experience, this report emphasizes total community involvement and the importance of working in groups. &quot;Difficulties encountered&quot; included semantic problems, professional semantics vs. nonprofessional; bungling of the research aspect, since project and research were not conceived as a unit; and an attempt to handle more territory than was possible, given the time limit of the project.

Objectives were to: analyze and interpret data from school districts in the 23 States participating in the Johnson-O'Malley Act program; evaluate closely related and concomitant information pertaining to enrollment growth, Indian impacts, resources ability factors, with a priority basis to follow; and develop general policy and guidelines for use by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in funding construction in areas of high Indian enrollment and for meeting backlogs which along with the regularized program will provide a total Federal  policy to improve Federal interaction with Indian impacted public school districts. Questionnaires were sent to some 458 public school districts; 162 districts in 21 states responded. Some findings were: immunity of Indian reservation lands from taxation is an important factor in the school district's ability to finance needed facilities; based on the widely accepted ability measure, the amount of taxable evaluation behind each child, Indian related school districts are much \"poorer\" in comparison with similar type districts in their States; and unused bonding capacity is a vital factor in most school districts' ability to share the cost of constructing facilities for the education of reservation based Indian children.

Findings emphasized a high rate of failure and underachievement among Indian students; minimal community  school interaction (due to poor administration, which minimized informational communication); lack of written education, parent/school, administrative, or personnel policies; lack of available data on curriculum policy; and a recognizable tax break in favor of non-Indian constituencies.

The committee then undertook the Small Schools Project to: identify the strengths and evident weaknesses which smallness brings in its wake; commission a survey of the literature relative to these strengths and weaknesses; and conduct an inventory of all NCA small  schools (schools with 300 or fewer students in grades 9-12) to determine the extent to which certain effective practices used by small schools are in effect in NCA small schools.

Real and ideal self-concepts were measured through Gough Adjective Check Lists. State and trait anxieties were indexed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. The comparison of pre- and post-course tests revealed that at the conclusion of the experience real self-concepts became more positive and more closely approached ideal  self-concepts. Both state and trait anxieties decreased following participation. Low state and trait anxiety scores were found to be related to positive real self-concept measures. Females exhibited higher ideal self-concepts while males displayed a smaller discrepancy between real and ideal selves. Because the direction of all changes was the same for both sexes, it was concluded that Outward Bound participation had similar effects on male and female state anxiety, trait anxiety, real self-concept, and ideal self-concept.

The ultimate goal was to graduate citizens who were knowledgeable and conscientious about environmental concerns. This report describes and assesses the impact of this project on Guam and provides a source of feedback, a source of suggestions for further improvement, and a vehicle for dissemination of information. The report contains three categories of data--contextual data, program data, and evaluation data. Contextual data concern the economic and demographic factors of the locale and organizational and financial problems of the school system. Program data provide information on personnel, procedures, equipment, training, community  involvement, and expenditures. The evaluation data focus on the behavioral objectives and goals, and instruments for measuring them. The final section, Conclusion and Recommendations, notes that the students in pilot schools developed an awareness of the need for, and interest in, preserving the environment. An overview of the curriculum adaptations, and a sample teacher evaluation sheet are included in the appendices. (Author/TK)",

The population included nine schools in Columbus. Input was received from 9 principals, over 90 teachers and 140 parents. The method used to evaluate was an opinionnaire created by principals and teachers from public and parochial schools in Columbus. The instrument was made up of six sections: equipment and materials, classroom programs, teacher strengths and weaknesses, staff strengths and weaknesses, organization and overall evaluation of the science program. The results of the study indicate that a majority of the staff felt the science program is  weak. There is a lack of equipment with the textbook-lecture approach used most often and few child-oriented activities. In addition, community resource personnel were not utilized. The major recommendations involved adopting programs that are activity oriented, making better use of resource teachers and improving communication in the area of materials and supplies. Finally on a state level, it is recommended that standards place too much emphasis on material objects per se and too little on the staff's knowledge of the use of these materials. (Author/BR)",

The discussion attempts to show why process, and not content, should be the primary emphasis in elementary school science teaching by examining the history of elementary school science in the United States, cognitive development, and the preparation of teachers. The results indicate that educators regard the development of competence in use of the scientific method and the development of the scientific attitude the most important objectives of science instruction. Developmental psychologists such as Montessori, Piaget, and Bruner believe that child cognition is enhanced when pupils use the processes of science. Finally,  there is evidence that elementary school teachers can be better trained to teach a process-oriented curriculum because it requires little understanding of the concepts and principles of science and does not require teachers to keep up to date with scientific information.

Specific objectives of the handbook are: (1) to establish a rationale for developing school sites for use in environmental education: ecological, instructional, economic, and community benefits; (2) to provide guidelines for organizing a school site development effort; (3) to point out pitfalls one may encounter in site development efforts; (4) to provide strategies, ideas, and  techniques for teachers to use in order to draw the most instructional benefit from the development and use of the school site; (5) to point out ways to achieve the maximum number of spin-off benefits from the development of the site; and (6) to provide selected references to written materials and available institutional and human resources. This handbook is written with the belief that one motivated individual can rally the school and community interest and support necessary to cooperatively develop a school site. (Author/BT)",

        "description":"This course, developed for use in secondary and adult education, is an effort to describe the cost-benefit ratio of the various methods of generation of electrical power in an era when the requirement for additional sources of power is growing at an ever-increasing rate and environmental protection is a major concern. This course was written and compiled by an independent committee drawn from educators, engineers, health physicists, members of industry and conservation groups, and environmental scientists. Among the topics discussed are the increasing need for electrical power and methods for meeting this need, nuclear power and fossil fueled plants, the biological effects of nuclear and fossil fueled plants, wastes in the production of electric power, plant site considerations,  energy conservation, and the environmental effects of electrical power generation. The appendixes include a glossary of terms, a bibliography, a decision-making model and a brief outline of the procedures which must be followed by a utility in order to construct and operate a nuclear power plant.

The three elements (educational objectives, learning experiences, and evaluation activities), when specified and cross-checked, yield a configuration indicating what the student is to achieve, how he is to achieve it, and how he will know he has achieved it. The goodness of fit of the program was depicted by developing instructional materials to assist students in completing a diet history. The design of the forms called for the gradual shaping of the students' behavior over two distinctive periods of instruction and incorporating a self-scoring diagnostic checklist. The forms were in the developing  stage at the time of this publication. Copies of the forms are included. (Author/EB)",

        "description":"This program, developed for the primary grades, was started in September 1972 with the ultimate goal being the development (sixth-grade students) of citizens knowledgeable and conscientious about environmental concerns. A cadre of specially trained teachers utilized the adapted SCIS materials with emphasis on student planning and involvement, independent projects, and outdoor activities. In September 1973 the project was expanded horizontally. The final evaluation made assessments of cognitive developments, affective improvements and overall project success as perceived by teachers in the project. At all grade levels cognitive achievement, as measured by criterion referenced tests, surpassed expected levels. Acquisition of scientific attitudes was judged by individual teachers by  means of a rating scale; in all grades the percentages of those who received higher than average ratings surpassed the expected level of 60 percent when the ratings on all factors were averaged. Using Semantic Differential scales, graduates of the program were appraised on the development of a positive attitude toward conservation of the environment; more than 60 percent were found to be in the ideal quadrant of the semantic space; it was inferred that the majority of the program participants developed desired levels of favorable attitudes.

The basic concept around which the guide is developed is the idea that the environment contains many interdependent things. Water, wind, clouds, non-living objects, plants, animals, and pollution are dealt with as part of the primary student's environment. These ideas are introduced to the student through a poem-story. Each page of the story is illustrated and there is an object missing from each illustration. The student must decide what is missing from the pictured environment. The missing objects are pictured at the end of the story, and the student is instructed to color, cut, and paste the object in the appropriate picture, completing the environment. A post-test completes  the guide; it is a multiple choice test designed to be administered orally to the student. (TK)",

It was found that the aides helped teachers to expand their existing programs by assisting in supervision, research and program development, and instruction. This guide provides a framework for other teacher groups wishing to develop an aide program. The volunteer aide program is based on 15 sessions of inter-disciplinary environmental education instruction. These activities and concepts in the 15 sessions are aimed at familiarizing the aide with ecological concepts, techniques for field work with children, and teaching approaches stressing inquiry and  discovery. The 15 sessions, which cover such topics as the inquiry approach, classifying, field and forest communities, compass and mapping skills, and mathematics, are covered in the guide. Each session focuses on one topic and includes activities, suggestions, references, diagrams, and illustrations. Suggestions for organizing an aide program, sample registration forms, a bibliography and resources are also included. (TK)",

Forty-six first-year mathematics students were interviewed during the year and just after the examination; results strongly suggested that the distribution and amount of study time is a factor of considerable importance in mathematics achievement. As a general conclusion it was hypothesized that earlier studies failed to show any consistent relationship between study behavior and achievement because measures of the amount and distribution of the number of hours of studying invested by the students  were not included.

The purpose of the encounters is to develop an awareness and understanding of community environmental problems. The guide utilizes math, science and social studies in the study of urban environmental problems. Although the guide focuses on a specific community, the urban problems that are explored are common to most communities. The guide is divided into six cycles, each containing math, science and social studies activities. Each cycle is designed to be covered in seven days, the first six devoted to teaching and the seventh for testing. The cycles contain objectives and lessons which utilize math, science, and social studies; some cycles  contain tests and bibliographical materials. The lessons reinforce the lesson objectives, and include completion time, equipment lists, location, and procedure. The lessons within the guide make use of such activities as mapping and measuring, discussion, and sample analysis. (TK)",

The class learns through a series of mini-investigations using concrete manipulative experiences as a vehicle for the instructors to model desirable teaching strategies. Both formal and informal methods were used to assess the program. The formal assessment  consisted of pre- and post-testing a group of students, using the Allison Attitude Scale. Evidence demonstrated a high degree of success in improving the attitudes of preservice teachers toward science. The paper also presents a brief report on science teaching in Pennsylvania public elementary schools during the 1971-72 school year. (Author/EB)",

        "description":"The current malaise in social science education research is the result of a stalemate between social studies educators and their research activities at the university level: (1) The social studies educator is not held accountable for research as for teaching courses or supervising student teachers. (2) \"Research\" is so loosely defined that one can allege research without paying the costs in time. (3) The profession fails to define its inquiry and expertise parameters. (4) Applied research is emphasized to the detriment of basic research. (5) The methodological tools and data of other disciplines are not exploited. (6) The existing external funding matrices do not significantly reward research-oriented social studies educators. Criticizing existent research, encouraging  communities of interest and publication forums, and recognizing outstanding achievements will not suffice to change this situation. Instead, these \"environmental\" problems must be remedied, for instance, through political action strategies to gain release time, accountability procedures, and rewards for research; national research fellowships for joint research among pre- and postdoctoral fellows; the definition of expertise parameters in a national conference; and the development of a methodology and instrumentation monograph, as well as a basic research monograph.

        "description":"Little if any attempt has been made to speak to the issue of how geographic education and environmental education can be combined within the framework of geography. One of the major problems has been that people fail to see the relevance of abstract environmental concepts to their own lives and life styles. Studies reflect both a serious lack of knowledge and a failure to associate what one knows about the environment with behaviors appropriate with this knowledge. The two elements of the problem, the amount of knowledge and its relevance, can be met by designing programs which get people out into their environment, doing some sort of investigative activity to help them understand both the environmental principles involved, the quality of their own local environment, and their  interaction with it. Support for this approach comes from geographers' traditional approach to their subject, as well as from recent developments in educational psychology. One instance of how geography and environmental education have been blended together is a new environmental studies project for the Canadian YMCA. The wide selection of activities offered serves as an example of how field experiences meaningfully blend geographic and environmental concepts for a variety of age and interest levels. The experience of this project indicates that geographers are in danger of passing up an opportunity to capitalize on the widespread interest and concern about the environment. (Author/KSM)",

The need for such a proposal is cited in recent developments in structural model building in the area of memory called information processing and in the concern to bring individual differences into the main stream of theory construction. It is felt that if a process or mechanism can be measured reliably outside of the situation for which it is serving a theoretical purpose, then an immediate test of the validity of the theoretical formulation is included in the theory. A broad perspective of theory construction is described, showing how the individual differences approach fits into this perspective. Three  guidelines for a mechanism to mediate the observed empirical relationships between various independent variables and the key phenomenon of interest are outlined and illustrated. Some objections to the individual differences approach are discussed. The approach is defended for making individual differences variables as a fallout from nomothetic theory construction when such theories deal with fundamental processes of behavior. (Author/KSM)",

Relaxation and concentration techniques, exploration of altered states of consciousness, meditation, and dreams are described as used in classroom situations. Suggestions for a human potential unit are offered and ways to use the topics of parapsychology and research in transpersonal psychology are considered.

The analysis is divided into an exploration and categorization of different types of schools, a definition of different kinds of attitudes and behavior on the part of students, and an attempt to demonstrate relationships between school political climate and student attitudes and behaviors. Findings show that schools have general bureaucratic patterns of political life and that five different types of political systems can be found. The type of school does seem to make a significant difference in the attitudes of students toward political participation and their political environment. The most uniformly positive  attitudes are found in participant schools, showing that students need to share in the responsibilities and activities of an institution in order to establish important political attitudes which will support active citizenship. A political systems questionnaire, general attitude items, and school attitude items used in gathering data are appended. (Author/KSM)",

The philosophy of the art program and the roles of administrator, teacher, and parent are outlined. The underlying school community relationships, and the objective, goals, and purposes of art education are described. Phases of child development in general and for specific age groups from 4 to 18 years of age are given with the art characteristics of these age groups and their art program goals. Fundamental art concepts -- color, light and shade, design, and composition -- as well as the basic media, are outlined as to objectives, materials, and suggested projects. The remainder of the guide follows a format of objectives, materials, working knowledge, concepts, and suggested  projects in presenting several art techniques. Methods, motivations, and processes are not dictated but are left to the individual teachers. Techniques in the guide include the following: lettering, interior and mural design, paper and paper mache, batik, tie-dying, printing, silversmithing, enameling, stained glass, wood, leather, textiles, ceramics, and sand casting.

The reports reflect the workshop's goals to establish priorities for further study and to identify contributions and benefits of member countries from a study of the school as a focal point for social change. The major issues which arose in the workshop are the following: organization and relationships within the school, incentive systems for teachers, allocation of financial resources to the school, role of the inspectorate, and regional and local professional support to the school. The first report presents an analysis and taxonomy of the principal factors  influencing creativity of the school. Next, ways to strengthen creativity of the school, administrative relationships between the school and outside institutions, and organization and relationships within the school are reported. The final reports deal with interventions for strengthening the school's creativity and with professional support to the school. A list of workshop participants is appended. (Author/KSM)",

The guide is about people in the cities and about the planning, growth, and problems of cities. Themes cover the Baltimore city area, urbanization in Maryland, urbanization in the United States, and urbanization in the world. The disciplines of history, economics, geography, political science, sociology, and anthropology are woven into the content and learning activities. Techniques of discovery and inquiry are recommended. Specific learning experiences provide opportunities for the use of skills in a functional manner. A selected bibliography on city, state, and federal relationships in government; a list of selected  nonprint media on city, state, and federal relationships; and an annotated bibliography replace the use of a single textbook. Each of the four themes in introduced; has a list of objectives; and has schematically related content, understandings and generalizations, sample activities, and suggested skills. (Author/KSM)",

        "description":"This paper aims to give a brief account of the present provision of education in the United Kingdom which can in some way be characterized as reflecting the principles of recurrent education. Recurrent education refers to periods of formal or structured study, undertaken largely in institutions, at various stages in the lifespan of an individual. This is one of a number of member country reports on recurrent education issued by the Centre for Educational Research and Innovation for the Council of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The paper examines the present thinking on this subject in the United Kingdom and outlines possible future developments. Recurrent education in the United Kingdom is described in its two presently occurring forms of further  education and adult education. Future developments are foreseen in the extension of inservice provisions, in retraining of workers in industry and business, and in more adult education for cultural and recreational purposes.

Qestionnaires administered to principals, social studies teachers, and department heads in 50 public senior high schools in 1964 were re-administered in 1974. Results on the following topics are reviewed: the focus of revision and student attitudes, aspects of value education, and the nature of secondary curriculum revision. The emphasis on structuring the curriculum through interrelated concepts and organizing subject matter to include behavioral sciences as seen in the last decade is reflected in the questionnaire responses. The data show that there is much uniformity of response to various aspects of values education. A number of teachers and  department heads responded that specific values, morals, and attitudes should be taught as part of the social studies curriculum. Relatively few educators reported increased attention to the affective domain in classroom interaction. (Author/KSM)",

An historic overview of the Indian, Black, and Spanish language populations in Michigan begins the paper. Indicators of current conditions of life for minorities are presented in order of importance in sustaining human life. The survival cycle is described as a measurable cluster of employment, income, poverty, health, housing, and education. Presentation of the survival cycle is divided into chapters on economic status, health, housing, and education. Data was obtained from either the census of 1970 or from state agencies and from three special studies of the Michigan Health  Survey. Other chapters deal with public order, group memberships, migrants, and grants to minorities. Summary charts for each county present a profile of the key factors discussed in the report.

The investigation was reported in three phases: 1) description of the general and specific experimental environments in which the experimental studies were conducted; 2) presentation of the results of an education-demographic survey conducted in 17 towns on the Yucatan peninsula; and 3) an account of a series of experimental studies designed to represent a variety of cognitive skills. The basic scheme of these studies was to work with children of varying ages and educational experiences, plus one or more groups of adults whose educational  experience matched that of one of the groups of children. It was concluded that educational experience has a profound effect on cognitive development as displayed in the formal test situations currently in use in all industralized countries to measure such development. Appended are the results of a demographic survey, modernity prediction scale, scoring for the scale and survey, and results of a pilot study of instructional variation. (Author/KSM)",

Part One comtains a resume of priority areas in educational policy, such as basic education, national development strategies, reform of upper secondary education, diversification of post-secondary education, recurrent education, and teachers and innovation. Two major conclusions emerge from these priorities: that the role of education has broadened  into one of a social service and that education has to be more closely related to other policies of government if the social service objectives are to be realized. Specific findings are discussed in the three chapters of Part Two: Growth in Enrollments and Teacher Supply, The Costs of Education, and Changes in Education Structures and in the Quality of Education.

Using this approach students generalize from their personal experience to concepts about humans and societies. Fifteen teachers from eight countries developed the project for students between the ages of 11 and 18. The first section describes in general the experience situations, discussion techniques, and followup activities. The second section provides a set of guidelines for the teacher to apply the approach to specific subject areas such as biology, literature, writing, language, physical sciences, mathematics, and the arts. Section 3 discusses the teacher's role in reacting to the  pupils' emotions. Section 4 examines the variations of approach according to age group and educational level. Section 5 describes the inservice teacher training for the project. Section 6 presents an evaluation of the project. Section 7 provides detailed procedures of 24 experience situations, class discussion ideas, followup projects, and applications to specific school subjects. Shorter summaries of 34 additional experience situations are also provided. The 58 total units include role playing situations, experiments in perception, communication and group behavior, questionnaire studies, action projects within the school and community, simulation and projective exercises, and fantasy scenarios.

The panel states that aesthetic sensitivity is the ultimate goal of music education; however, the attitude items in the assessment do not measure sensitivity directly but measure &quot;approach tendencies&quot; which correlate to some degree with sensitivity. Six questions expanded upon in the assessment are: 1) How often do you seek out and listen to music that you like to hear on television, radio, records, or tapes? 2) How often do you attend live musical programs outside of school? 3) Are there any kinds of music that you like to listen to? 4) Do you like to sing? 5) Can you  play a musical instrument? 6) What are your reactions to singing and playing an instrument in small and large groups? National statistics pertinent to each question and reactions from the music panel are presented. The same exercises are then analyzed according to region, sex, color, parental education, and community type.

        "description":"Cultural event analysis assists traditional social science methodologies--ethnographies and survey instruments--in the study of urban life. Testing a hypothesis--that educational problems arise and persist for Puerto Rican youth because of contrast, contrariety, and noncomplementarity between the cultural forms and patterns of their home life and school life in urban Chicago--requires interculturally comparable data. Applying cultural event analysis to test the hypothesis produces such data. By viewing a sample of 30 seventh grade, culturally mixed students as 30 &quot;ego networks&quot; with linkages to individual teachers, household adults, and peers, a context for the analysis is established. Analysis of events occuring within linkages between the students and the other members of their  networks invites comparison of those events. Defining and characterizing &quot;event&quot; in the abstract is accomplished first, in order to accurately assess a real event. A sample event observation form indicates how the defining of &quot;event&quot; translates into collection of data in the field. By casting data in the form of comparable events, cultural differences can be isolated and tested. This is done, for example, in a question on students' interpretations of &quot;joking relationships.&quot; Event analysis applied in this study is a useful conceptualizing tool. (JH)",

The analysis system is a systematic means of identifying, classifying, and clarifying factors found in social conflict situations. Students are also expected to gain insights into forces that change social structures. Through case study students become aware of unfamiliar as well as creative solutions to threatening and dangerous conflict predicaments. Students who complete case study conflict analyses should be more sensitive to alternative conflict solutions, and perhaps more skillful at handling social conflict dilemmas. Suggestions are given to teachers for applying the system in the classroom as illustrated in an example. Suggestions are also  provided for developing case study materials. (Author/JH)",

Mastery learning is an alternative which gives lower performing students the necessary additional time to learn while the progress of the higher aptitude student is retarded by withholding of additional learning tasks. Twenty grade 7 classes from Savannah-Chatham County School District, Georgia, were chosen as the experimental population. Mastery and nonmastery units were randomly assigned to classes in each school. Tests were administered to measure the students' learning and retention of the content materials. The results indicated that high  and middle aptitude self-instructional mastery treatment students retained more than high and middle aptitude nonmastery students. Middle aptitude mastery students learned more than middle aptitude nonmastery students. There was no difference between learning and retention for low aptitude students across treatments. Therefore, the differences between aptitude levels were increased rather than diminished when self-instructional mastery units were used. The educational implications were that mastery treatment facilitated superior achievement at the price of less work covered in the time period, and that mastery treatment for low aptitude students could be effective only with close and careful teacher feedback instead of self-instruction.

Diablo Unified School District, designed and ran a materials evaluation program of 49 curriculum project materials, 8 simulation games, and 5 multimedia kits dealing with global perspective. The objective of the program was to use materials evaluation as a means to make local schools effective instruments in teaching about human dignity and global problems. The program was designed to use the existing school structure, involve the community, and set up a self-evaluation to test results. Materials for evaluation were chosen according to global perspective, organization of content, quality of supplementary materials, flexibility, format, reading level, and cost.  District social studies teachers were responsible for testing the materials in the classroom and for completing a lesson log sheet, evaluation questionnaire, and oral evaluation. The results were a 35 percent increase in the use of global perspective materials, an increase in intraschool and interschool communication, and a handbook of materials evaluation. Appendixes include a sample teacher evaluation, log sheet, and list of materials tested. An edited handbook of the materials evaluation is available through the Center for War/Peace Studies and as ED 096 236. (DE)",

        "description":"In order to promote change in teaching about conflict and war, a Mt. Diablo California Unified School District elementary school established an ongoing consultation program for considering teacher values and curriculum content. The plan called for a collaborative effort in combining the methodology of mental health consultation with resource persons familiar with social studies curriculum and inservice teacher training. Consultation meetings with faculty, principal, and consultant team occurred twice a month for seven months. The process of the meetings, which was to determine the direction of the goals, was left to the faculty participants. Over a period of months resistance among the participants developed within the group process. Certain issues were not talked about, as goal  setting began to take on less importance in the meetings than the introduction of new curriculum content. Resistance developed to the leadership of the principal. The results of the program were both positive and negative. Whereas progress was made in the effort to implement new curriculum ideas, many of the participants felt it did not go far enough in values and goal clarification. Most of the teachers and the principal felt they were more understanding and comfortable with others at the end of the program. All identified a greater understanding and ease with the presence of conflict after working through conflict situations within the group process. The results indicated the possibility that the school could be the environment and unit of change for more effective resolution of  conflict. (DE)",

It investigates the issues and problems facing families with preschool children, when both of the parents are employed. The composite portrait of family styles within a sample of 14 young families begins with a project history. The literature is reviewed, the inception of the project described, and the research design presented. To discover how individuals view their families and relate to them, five research instruments, all appended, were developed: interviews; daily logs; demographic forms; observation instructions; and participant observations. The following chapters each deal with an aspect of one of the series of transformations initiated in the organization of the home by  the wife's working. These include allocation of child care and household responsibilities; nonparental child care; pressures, motivations, and satisfactions of parenting in dual-working families; and the coordination of home and work. It was generally concluded that the effects of maintaining primary control over child care are widespread in the family system, that the consequences of the decision of the wife to work extend to the relations between the spouses, and that an image of the irritable wife and mother was one response of the working mother who accepts all cultural expectations without awareness of the psychological strain this induces.

At least one major objective is stated for each section, followed by specific objectives  that indicate the level of learning, content, and means of evaluation. Most specific objectives are followed by several activities which indicate how the student will attain the objective or which may be considered as subobjectives. Art materials are suggested within the objectives and activities. (SH)",

        "description":"Realizing that all students have to deal with death at some time, yet receive no formal education in the subject, Alex Kramer, a high school teacher at Moon High School, Corapolis, Pennsylvania, decided to create a program which would give students an opportunity to study death and the process of dying as integral parts of life. Kramer's goals, designed for his behavioral science class of juniors and seniors, are to promote realistic attitudes about death and to dispel myths and fears associated with it. To achieve these objectives, death is studied from several perspectives. Students are visited by doctors, nurses, ambulance attendants, and a mortician, all of whom deal with different aspects of death. They read letters from wartime soldiers who faced the probability of their  own death daily. Students tour cemeteries, hold class discussions on topics such as euthanasia and cryonics, and answer questionnaires on their own religion's response to death. To evaluate his class, Kramer requires his students to answer a questionnaire. It reveals that by treating death as a fact of life students fear death less and appreciate life more. (Author/CF)",

        "description":"A junior high school geography class in La Palma, California, offers extensive field trip experiences to teach students methods of historical-geographical research. Resulting from a course that develops research methods in social studies, a club was formed that provides overnight excursions in various field activities. The club is open to 9th and 10th grade students who have completed prerequisite course offerings that provide background in the fundamentals of historical research. Through the use of primary and secondary source materials, students develop skills in map and chart reading and interpreting survey reports and aerial photographs. Members of the club apply this knowledge while participating in field expeditions that can last from a 3-day weekend trip to 11-day outings  during long school vacations. In the field, students learn the techniques of historians, geographers, archaeologists, and geologists in identifying geological landmarks, looking for historical artifacts, and surviving in primitive conditions. One such activity allowed the students to spend a week at Fort Bridger, a nearby community resource, living as much like the original poineer inhabitants as possible. Students keep accurate logs of their activities and findings. Evaluation is based on students' written reports and overall performances. After completing the course students view social studies as a vital, living study and better understand the importance of cooperation and working together. (Author/JR)",

Process of the Social Scientist (POSS) is a 2-year program for the combined sixth/seventh grade which places primary emphasis on the process used by working social scientists rather than on the content of the discipline. POSS stresses methods, techniques, and ways of thinking, rather than names, dates, and places. Students study geography, history, and political science in their first year, followed by anthropology, sociology, and economics in their second year. The History, Anthropology, Sociology, Political Science, Economics, Geography (HASPEG) curriculum is the POSS counterpart for eight graders. The HASPEG curriculum centers  around short study units, each dealing with a topical problem or concern emerging from one of the disciplines. The entire program incorporates the innovative teaching concepts of team-teaching, multidisciplinary studies, contract learning, miniunits, teacher-developed curriculum, and process learning. Teacher and student response has been enthusiastic as many students feel that the curriculum is more interesting and helps them to remember more. (Author/DE)",

Next, a teaching unit on propaganda describes seven forms of propaganda to be illustrated by transparencies and discussed in class.

The hypothesis is that involvement in extracurricular activities, school partisan political activities, and exposure to formal course work in social studies is positively related to political participation. Results of testing 1,811 high school students in Washington, D. C. indicate that extracurricular activities and school partisan political activities are not consistently positive in correlation with political participation. The correlation between the number of social studies courses the student takes and political participation is also weak. When testing for civics and government courses that  include involvement in real political and community activities the correlation with later political participation is positive. The major implication of the report is that, if one wants to promote political participation, class activities and extracurricular activities should include out-of-class, real political and community activities.

After analyzing Kohlberg's stages of moral development, the first section of the paper stresses that the environmental educator needs to facilitate student dialogue and reasoning appropriate to the student's moral stage and to encourage progress to the next level. Seven values objectives are provided for the teacher that include the development of equality, empathy, factual knowledge, social ethical principles, personal ethical principles, moral judgments and resolutions, and action. Ten specific teaching processes for guiding the classroom teachers in developing questions for student reflection are presented. The first three instructional models set forth processes for  teaching basic skills for ethical analysis and reasoning. The three processes which follow stress an empathetic mode for understanding others' values and feelings. The next two processes involve contemplating stressing introspection and shaping of one's own ethos and worldview. The last two are analytic, demanding the student to set forth the reason and principles which warrant his particular judgment and then defend these reasons in ways appropriate to his moral development.

A model of activities involved in the research application process includes two areas of strength: (1) basic research on a constructed theory and (2) the development of technology and its practical application. Collation and interpretation of research--a demanding task--and the function of translating, or facilitating communication between research communities and the world of practice, are intermediating activities that need to be emphasized and recognized. The second cause of failure was conceptualized during an investigation of learning research: characteristics of experimental  procedure found to determine a study's application potential became more applicable as experimenter control declined. For instance, an artifically controlled environment makes a study's application less practicable than a natural one. A similar continuum operates on the objective, task, stimulus, response, motivation, and time elements of basic research. One way to make basic research more applicable would be to define an investigatable problem through an analysis of an operational problem rather than through a review of prior basic research or through theory alone.

Results of the study show that introductory courses teach supply and demand, product markets, national income accounts, fiscal policy, monetary policy, factor markets, consumer choice, and international economics. Community college instructors also tend to include history of economic thought, current economic problems, and comparative economic systems. Ninety-five percent of the instructors lecture--most with the reinforcement of discussion and programmed or audiovisual materials. Two texts, Samuelson's and McConnell's, are  the most widely used. A macro-microeconomics approach to the course is used by 94 percent of the instructors. Our present, unpredicted economic state, compared with the relatively unvaried content of economic courses, suggests the need for new approaches, among them, perhaps, a chronological study of economic analysis, world-wide economic models, emphasis on psychological and philosophic determinants, and others.

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a self-administering questionnaire which can be used for measuring student learning styles. Direction of interest, perception, judgment, and life style are measured by the MBTI, and learning styles can be ascertained from these measures. Self-paced learning systems with various learning activities can be adopted. Research at the University of Florida indicates that there is a correlation between a student's score on the MBTI  and his preference for college teaching methods and that the individualization of instruction with a variety of learning experiences is a desirable teaching strategy for college teachers. The practical research model for improving college teaching requires research studies which would measure teacher and student learning styles through use of the MBTI. The data gathered from such research could be used by the faculty to design more appropriate learning experiences for students. (HMD)",

Generally, such studies have used the class, the school, or the community as the unit of sampling with the consequence that investigators have based the number of degrees of freedom in their statistical calculations on the number of classes. However, the author believes that a further distinction must be made: that is, between effects that operate at the class level and effects that operate within the class. The variance in an outcome measure can be divided into between-class and within-class components. The between-class variance can in  turn be divided into variance predicted from the aptitude level of the class and a residual. The within-class variance can be subdivided into the effect predicted from the within-class regression equation and a residual. The regression equation with each single class can then be computed and the residual reduced still further. The author has developed methods for completing such analysis and applies them to previous studies to show the effect of such analysis on the outcomes of studies. (HMD)",

Types of documents included project and research reports, syntheses of theory and research, precis of doctoral theses, program proposals, and evaluation studies. Programs to improve the teaching of reading and math to disadvantaged students were numerous, and introductions to new curricula in other subject areas were well presented. Although many subjects were treated, the reports reflect little attempt to formulate a comprehensive program. Too often, objectives were narrow and unrelated to a larger purpose, and most of the programs focused on the teacher as an individual rather than as a member of a group. None of the reported programs was comprehensive, dealing broadly with the  professionalization of teachers in a full sense. Few of the reports dealt with formal graduate study. Four documents dealing with broad concerns are identified, and a 30-item selected annotated bibliography is included. (MBM)",

Some options are identified as eliminating nonproductive programs and courses, emphasizing training in areas where shortages exist, refocusing the orientation of institutions to meet the training needs of nonschool settings, and expanding school service components, particularly inservice and continuing education oriented to the needs and aspirations of teachers in school situations. It is impossible to predict accurately the number of new teachers that will be needed in the future, and additional questions are therefore whether society will be willing to support a teaching force adequate for peak demand periods and  whether employment alternatives should be considered. The teacher surplus does not take into account the growing need for new types of learning facilitators in nonschool settings, and these options should be considered as part of a realistic response to preparing multifaceted personnel for all of America's learning institutions.

He then suggests that these institutions do not provide the proper environment and resources for the adequate preparation of teachers. The author asserts that Dewey's famous laboratory school is the lone example of the testing ground of frontier educational theory and that society will spend millions of dollars reaffirming what it already knows or reinforcing educational practices which are consistent with a conservative political ethic. The author believes that not one of the many critics of teacher education today directs his criticisms to the vital center of the teacher preparation  problem--that the knowledge base of today's teacher is incongruent with cultural reality. The teacher of tomorrow needs to be acquainted with the traditional social sciences and with the newer behavioral sciences. (HMD)",

Despite the concern and apparent need for teacher aides, many problems have arisen concerning the definition of their duties. Educators have found numerous discrepancies between teachers' and administrators' definitions of responsibilities of teacher aides. Duties pertaining to teacher aides can be subdivided according to instructional and noninstructional tasks. The definition for each subdivision depends on the community, educational attainment of the aides, and the philosophy of the school district involved. (Author/HMD)",

        "description":"Ambivalent feelings about achievement and success which affect the career choices of women are caused by the kind of educational experiences prevalent in the United States today. The distinction between sexes is recognized by children at age 2 and by kindergarten, girls show dependency in achievement-related situations. During their elementary school years, a significant number of females show a decline in intelligence test scores. The reinforcement of sex-role stereotypes takes place continually in schools, and the resulting conflict between being feminine and being successful causes young women to show an increasing tendency as they progress through high school and college to exhibit anxiety in achievement-related situations. In recent studies, the motive to avoid success was  fairly commonplace among women--47 percent among junior high school students, rising progressively to 88 percent among college women. The educational system must develop an awareness of the ways in which it belittles the achievements of women. Textbooks and other materials which promote stereotypic images of women must be revised, and teachers should receive awareness training to discourage prolongation of inequality between the sexes.

Chapter 3, \"Physiological Factors Affecting Speed and Its Development,\" examines speed improvement occurring through physiological changes in muscle and joint tissue, circulation, and the nervous system resulting from commonly used supplementary programs  (any program other than sprint training). The final chapter, \"Training the Sprinter,\" analyzes important research in miscellaneous areas that directly affects sprinting speed, supplementary training programs, and the critical area of sprint training programs, which includes sprint-resisted and sprint-assisted training. Lists of references and selected reading conclude each chapter. (JA)",

        "description":"This report summarizes and discusses the results of the Texas Teacher Effectiveness Project, a two-year, replicated, naturalistic-correlational study of the relationships between presage and process variables with student learning product criteria at the second- and third-grade levels. Both linear and nonlinear relationships between predictor variables and the student learning gains criteria (class means averaged across four consecutive years on each of five subtests of Metropolitan Achievement Test battery) are reported. In general, the data make more sense in separate analyses for low versus high SES (socioeconomic status) schools than they do for the combined sample, and a great many significant relationships proved to be curvilinear or otherwise nonlinear. Major findings  consistently contrast with findings from instruction in higher grade levels, suggesting that teaching fundamental tool skills in the early grades is fundamentally different from verbal manipulation of symbolic materials that typifies teaching at later grades, and therefore it should be conceptualized and studies separately. Additional points are detailed in the report. (Author)",

It was hypothesized that nutritional education would influence the amount and kinds of food consumed and possibly student attitudes toward the school linch program. The project was carried out in a 2-year experimental program. During the first year, elementary, junior high, and high school students were queried before and after nutritional education classes to measure weight and nutrient analysis of food refuse, student attitudes, and student ratings of acceptability of food items. Results of this phase indicate that elementary school children below the fifth grade might be more amenable to changes in dietary habits and attitudes due to nutrition education. Studies  during the second year focused on primary grades. Also included in this study are information about curriculum development and inservice training of teachers, details of purposes, proposed methods for accomplishing goals, results, statistical analyses, and sample tests.

Two criterion-referenced tests--the Prescriptive Reading Test--as well as self-observation scales were administered to the students. Aides completed two questionnaires--Role and Function Study and Aide Time Allotment Study. Teachers completed Educator's Professional Values Scale and Teacher Time Allotment Study. The purpose of the aides program was seen as the  selection, training, and utilization of citizens of the local community as education aides; the encouragement of career advancement; increased school/community communication; improvement in the teaching/learning environment; training for paraprofessionals; and improvement in student and adult self-concept.

The speech lists assumptions used in the formulation of new regulations adopted by the Vermont State Board of Education. These assumptions include the beliefs that teacher education is a continuous process from early preparation until retirement, that the individual teacher must be actively involved in determining the criteria by which he or she will be evaluated and by whom, and that colleges and school districts must share the responsibility for teacher education.  The speech describes Vermont's new certification procedures, which include the following components: (a) initial certification--graduates of state-approved teacher education programs who have demonstrated identified basic competencies for beginning teachers and who are recommended for certification by their college; (b) certification renewal--recommendation of teachers who have demonstrated the competencies identified; (c) inservice training programs with authorized local certification privileges; and (d) individualized self-evaluation programs at the local level.

The document views the educational needs of children and youth as a continuum beginning at about age 3 and ending (for elementary and secondary purposes) at about age 18. The premise of the continuum is stated as follows: public education's primary task is meeting the needs of all children and youth as they prepare for adulthood. The corollary of the premise is as follows: the needs of all children and youth include continued and monitored educational progress through the years of required formal schooling, as well as readiness and adequacy for (a) a job, (b) satisfactory interpersonal relationships, (c) college, (d) other continuing  education, and (e) citizenship. Two models are presented. The first is &quot;Preparing Children for Adolescence&quot;; the second, derived from the first, is &quot;Preparing Youth for Adulthood.&quot; Each model has six steps: goals, performance objective areas, student-school needs assessment, new delivery system plans, inservice professional development program, and, recommendations to local district and state boards of education.

Guidelines for model development include the following elements: replicability, internal evaluation, external evaluations, and several components. The components are as follows: (a) the models must take accreditation into account, providing methods whereby school evaluations for accreditation purposes can be accomplished; (b) the models must provide a training component which may be in some form of a broadly defined inservice concept; (c) the models must provide for a needs assessment; (d) the models must be based on district- and building-level objectives which are commensurate with current  statewide programs of objective evaluation; (e) the model must provide a definition of competence in terms of goal accomplishment for all levels of educational tasks; and (f) the models must be directed to all individuals being certified under Section 77-8-1, New Mexico Annotated, 1953 compilation. Model locations have been identified. The schools involved in models development during 1973-74 will design the models, implement them, and then provide adequate opportunity and assistance to the state department for evaluation of the effectiveness of the models. The task force is committed to the concept of allowing the models to shape the common plan for certification and recertification rather than to the concept of developing a plan and requiring that the models conform to it.

In 1972, a task force was formed to investigate the concept of competency-based certification. In spite of the great activity in competency-based programs, New Mexico's task force has yet to identify one program on the national scene which is effective. Therefore, the New Mexico task force has operated and will continue to operate with a sense of caution. The task force feels  that if a competency-based approach is approved for development in New Mexico, it will have to be approved on the basis of a sound foundation relevant to the specific needs of New Mexico.

The effective teacher role is defined as being characterized by broad permeating attributes of behavior that distinguish this role from a less effective one. Procedures are discussed for the acquisition of a teaching role derived from the work of Stanislavski, which include the following steps: (a) the study of the role itself, (b) the search for material that becomes the medium through which the role is acted out, (c) the search for characteristics and attributes within the student of education that can become incorporated into the role, (d) the preparation of the student of education for undertaking the role in the classroom, and (e) the endless search for material to be  incorporated into the role to keep the role alive and to prevent it from becoming routinized. The author concludes that every teacher should be familiar with the mainstream of knowledge relating to child development and with models of intellectual and social framework of the teaching role that should consitute the essential core of teacher education.

The second section describes  an alternative approach to the relationship between funding agencies and researchers which has four elements: specifying major problems, obtaining simultaneous input from field researchers regarding possible projects, establishing alternative strategies for attaining goals, and communicating alternative strategies.

Chapter 6 presents a detailed report on the 1974 CBTE program.

Big-time athletic programs are financed in part by student fees whether the students wish to attend the games or not; consequently, student government associations and other student organizations are waging a bitter antiathletic compaign on many campuses. The Women's Liberation Movement is beginning to add to the financial trouble of big-time athletics by demanding equal athletic budgets. Second, the educational values of athletics are being questioned; there is little empirical evidence to support athletics as an educational endeavor. In recent years the socialization of sports has caused an overemphasis  on winning. The author recommends that two athletic programs should be established in our colleges and universities. One program would be highly recruited and labelled \"big-time,\" the objective of which would be entertainment. The other program would use nonrecruited athletes, the goal of which would be educational. This division will provide a program for those who wish to attempt the difficult climb to excellence and for those individuals who wish to play for fun. (JA)",

In addition to providing an overview of the program, the authors examine and discuss three areas in which contingency plans must be formulated in order to prevent the ascendency of a second orthodoxy. These areas are the philosophical foundations of PBTE,  priorities and directions for validating a PBTE- and field-based research as the bench mark of PBTE. (Author)",

The document includes a history of the Teacher Corps program, gives reasons for the evaluation study, and indicates methodology used. Two different kinds of information are woven together throughout the report: (a) generalized findings from the 10 Teacher Corps sites studied and (b) illustrative material drawn from two different sites--an urban university and a southern university. The summary of findings reports some intern dissatisfaction and friction with teachers.  Specific characteristics of interns and teachers in the program and school changes are among the areas covered in the summary of findings. Conclusions drawn from the study are reported at the end of the booklet. (JA)",

        "description":"Teachers in three California public schools were educated in the use of values clarification. Their experimental class groups were matched with other sixth-grade groups in the same schools. The teachers used selected value clarifying strategies for three months in their regular classes, adapting them as necessary to the health education content area. No changes in the health education curriculum were made, so that applicability of values clarification to health education could be explored in a range of content areas, which included mental health, safety and first aid, preparation for disaster, and nutrition. Evaluation was achieved through three approaches: (a) teacher assessment of success of value clarifying strategies by recording adaptations and use of strategies; (b) the  random selection of students for interviews to determine their use of the steps in the valuing process in relation to given problem situations; and (c) administration of pre- and post-tests designed to determine value clarity. The findings indicate that teachers react enthusiastically to the use of this teaching methodology, even to the extent of using the strategies in other areas of the curriculum and in individual counseling. The students who initially have unclear values demonstrate the greatest change in value clarity following values clarification emphasis. (Author/JA)",

The survey was distributed to 1,123 school administrators, including unit superintendents and all principals of middle, junior, and senior high schools and of selected large elementary districts with organizational patterns including junior high and/or middle schools. The survey consisted of two major parts, which sought information about program and personnel. Analysis of the survey results indicates the following: (a) ninety-four schools do not have a formal health education program; (b) one hundred twenty schools schedule health education with the science curriculum; (c) four hundred twenty-six schools schedule health education classes with physical  education; (d) one hundred forty schools reported health education as a distinct semester course; (e) fifty-one schools have integrated health education programs with health education units taught by teachers representing three or more disciplines; and (f) in grades six, seven, and eight health education classes are most often scheduled on a coeducational basis, and at the senior high level classes are most frequently scheduled according to sex. In summary, the survey has been useful in assessing health education program and needs in Illinois schools and by revealing four critical needs in health education in Illinois and providing a current roster of health education teachers.

        "description":"New certification standards adopted by the Washington State Board of Education in 1971 were designed to develop teacher education programs that ensure the highest quality of professional performance by teachers prepared within them. Teacher education programs under the new standards are approved by the State Board of Education only when three groups (personnel of colleges/universities involved in training teachers, school district or private school staffs, and professional association members closest to teaching) have developed a program cooperatively and are exercising equal authority. The consortium of these agencies, whose structure is designed to ensure comprehensive participation, must secure involvement of the various constituents who are concerned about high quality  teaching. The objective for teachers must focus on their actual performance (competence) as teachers. Once these competencies are identified, the actual training program must be structured to produce teachers who possess them. The new standards decentralize responsibility and accountability for preparation and the outcomes of preparation. The cooperative approach helps marshall resources of the various agencies, gives trainees more preservice experience in the schools, helps screen out those who should not continue within teacher preparation, and offers realistic preparation for the actual work of the teacher.

Current environmental, instructional, and structural problems in schools and school districts are identified. The intervention strategy known as organizational development is described, the psychological or social-psychological orientation of most current strategies is demonstrated, and a case is made for a structurally oriented survey-feedback approach to organization development in schools. Core elements in this survey-feedback approach are gathering information and developing a  preliminary diagnosis, developing an organization approach to problem solving, providing feedback of the survey results, selecting strategies for change, and evaluating the impact of the strategies. The report also describes the current developmental work of the program in this area and its plans for field testing the structural approach and making the techniques more widely available.

        "description":"In 1971 six rural, eastern Kansas School Districts collaborated with Kansas State Teachers College in the development of portal schools. Four-year goals and first-year objectives were established and a steering committee comprised of representatives of each significant role group was organized to transact business associated with the development of portal schools. After a year and a half, it became apparent that the attempt at collaborative decision making was unsuccessful. Therefore, a new model was developed based on the assumptions that; (a) the controllers of resources must be willing to share their power by responding to inputs from role groups, (b) the purpose and limits of the consortium must be clearly defined and agreed to by all parties, (c) a process for input and  shared decision making must be clearly defined, (d) commitment to the endeavor by member institutions is directly related to the amount of its resources invested, and (e) two decision-making bodies, one consisting of resource controllers and the other consisting of role group representatives, must be organized. The implementation of this model involved the formation of a Council of Administrators (resource controllers) and Master Steering Committee (role group representatives), development of an agreement document, specification of the decision-making process, and an increase in the amount of resources invested by each institution. Significant and encouraging developments have resulted from implementation of the new model. (HMD)",

The suggestions offered on how to best assess feelings draw on a variety of measurement techniques. The possibilities and problems involved in assessing student achievement of objectives in the affective domain are illustrated. The problems lie not only in the difficulty of appraising emotional responses that are often covert but also in selecting and defining objectives that are proper goals for the public schools. This means affective behavior that is of constructive value to the individual, that can be developed through school experience, that is not sectarian or politically partisan and is not an  unwarranted invasion of privacy. When objectives meeting these conditions are identified and defined, it is possible to assess, at least crudely, the student's achievement of these behavior patterns. (Author/RC)",

The purpose of the present report is to use Bayesian theory in examining the validity of this generalization. Using the t-test and Bayes' theorem we show that while the substitution of p for a (when p is less than a) reduces unconditional or simple power, it actually increases the conditional power of the test--i.e., the probability that the alternative hypothesis is true given a statistically significant result. Because of this, the substitution of p for a a posteriori (when p is less than a), i.e., acting as though the value of a is equal  to the obtained p value, seems to be a harmless practice at worst, and on the positive side, provides important information to the research consumer interested in the validity of the alternative hypothesis given the data of the study.

The basic components of the Ethos variable are Authenticity (for individual students), Legitimacy (in terms of knowledge and societal disciplines), and Productivity (effectiveness of activities). This variable is referred to by its acronym, ALP. An international study and a Chicago-based study using the ALP instrument have been begun. Forty-nine classrooms in the Chicago area have been analyzed and findings reported to the teachers. A series of variables related to ALP-Ethos in these schools is now being investigated. (Author)",

        "description":"The relationships between the characteristics of human tasks and the abilities required for task performance are investigated. The goal of the program is to generate principles which can be used to identify ability requirements from knowledge of the characteristics of a task and of variations in the conditions of task performance. Such knowledge has important implications for both selection and training of personnel. The relationship between variations in an electronic fault-finding task and consequent changes in the abilities related to fault-finding performance was investigated. Characteristics of the fault-finding task were manipulated by varying formal difficulty and perceptual complexity. Subjects received a battery of reference ability tests and then proceeded to perform  the criterion task under the different experimental conditions. To determine the relationship between task characteristics and ability requirements, the reference battery was factor analyzed to identify a reference ability structure. The loadings of various criterion task conditions on that structure were then estimated. Five separate ability factors were identified. Four were found to be related to criterion task performance. One seemed to be involved to the same extent across alternative versions of the task, while others increased or decreased as the task characteristics were manipulated. (Author/SM)",

Assessment plans make it impossible to identify individual teachers or schools. Thus, the fear that someone may be penalized because of a bad assessment is not realistic. Furthermore, all school systems at present do a great deal of testing. If school authorities wanted to use test results as evaluating instruments, they already have plenty of information to go on. The main problem in all assessment programs is that results are expected too quickly. Emphasis should be on longitudinal studies and comparison after multiple completions of the testing cycle.

On one hand the public and legislators are requesting more state testing programs and assessment programs, while on the other, educators realize the problems concerning testing and test interpretation. Difficulties arise when tests are misinterpreted and misused. A proposed moratorium by the National Education Association is not the answer to the problem since it would destroy the continuum of data and create a critical information gap. Reporting systems based on criterion referenced measurement, the use of computers to find patterns from which to generate interpretations, and further use of adjusted scores can help to alleviate some of the problems.

There is also a four-way interdependency between comprehensiveness, measurement reliability, test length, and curriculum span.

        "description":"A review of the literature in 1965 revealed considerable research into the respective merits of policies of (1) automatic promotion for all pupils, and (2) rigid retention-in-grade for those whose achievement was judged deficient. Although neither extreme was a panacea, promotion appeared to have fewer disadvantages than retention. Pupils who repeated one or more grades tended to become discouraged by their conspicuous failure and to be no better off at the end of their schooling than if they had been promoted each year with their age-mates. Studies since 1965 have suggested that for maximal learning to take place, the crucial issue is how the individual pupil is treated in his school--including how he is either promoted or retained--rather than the adoption of one policy or  another. They call for (1) human treatment of each pupil as a person of value, and (2) creative provision of appropriate learning tasks in which the individual pupil can experience success. To assure these conditions, the role of the educator who works with each pupil is no less critical than that of the policy maker. (Author/RC)",

Phase 1 recommended the further development of group specific norms for officers, NCOs, and airmen enrolled in technical training schools. In Phase 2 additional items were added to the prototype form resulting in a later version of the critique form that had a reliability of .80. The Phase 2 version of the Student Critique Form (SCF) was administered to a sample of over 1,800 students enrolled in technical training courses at six Air Force bases. Norms were gathered separately for officers, NCOs, and airmen. Seven scales emerged from a factor analysis of the Phase 2 version of the SCF: Instructor Competence, Study Environment and Testing, Specialty Training,  Training Impressions, Classroom Facilities and Environment, Training Devices and Audio Visual Aids, and Training Materials Adequacy. Phase 2 of this effort was subsequently initiated to develop the computer software to score and interpret the SCF. (Author/RC)",

Members of the Armed Forces (stratified by sex, age, years in service, and rank) were interviewed regarding their educational background, decision to enter the service, reasons for going to school, and problems they encountered in returning to school. Problems usually involved lack of study time, scheduling difficulties, and difficulty in obtaining transcripts from all schools attended. In spite of these difficulties, however, many service people are attending courses to further their education. Many subjects had recommendations for improvement of the program such as allowing time off for those attending classes and  improved information dissemination about the SOC. As a result of SOC participation, many colleges have effected changes in educational policy involving residency requirements, CLEP examinations, and restructuring of course length, thus making it easier for the geographically mobile service members to secure an education. Many have decided to reenlist to take advantage of this educational opportunity. SOC has apparently been successful as evidenced by those persons interviewed. (SM)",

The games were generated by varying a payoff parameter which altered the potential maximum per trial difference between payoffs for the two players. The groups differed systematically in terms of the types of numerical representations chosen for each game. For each pair of games, the subjects were asked to indicate which strategy for each game they would choose to play against a hypothetical opponent and for which of the two games they would most prefer to play the dominant strategy. The paired-comparison data for each subject was entered into a dominance matrix and processed by triangular analysis. The  data from 33 of the 35 subjects yielded satisfactory unidimensional scales. It was concluded that it is possible to scale qualitatively different games along the same dimension. It was further concluded that most game players prefer to select strategies which will maximize the difference between their score and their opponent's score even when those strategies are not dominant.

Students over 44 years old were excluded from the study, as were certain other specialized types of students (migrants, institutionalized students, and students in classes emphasizing English as a second language). There were approximately 500,000 students enrolled in the ABE program in FY 1970; 280,000 of these fell within the study's scope. The sample investigated by the study included 2,300  students in 200 classes, 90 programs, and 15 states. Data were collected on program and classroom characteristics; students were tested twice and interviewed three times. The interval between tests was usually four months; followup interviews were obtained at intervals of 12 and 18 months after initial interviews. Interview forms were specially developed; the test battery consisted of portions of the Tests of Adult Basic Education. (Author/RC)",

A history of state testing programs is outlined, and new directions for such programs are proposed. Criterion-referenced and norm-referenced testing is contrasted, and the advantages and limitations of criterion-referenced tests are indicated. The problem of evaluating affective  educational outcomes is explored and may be explained by the very limited role of noncognitive tests in state testing programs. The relation between the purposes of testing and the time of year the tests are given is discussed, and this timing is seen to affect the extent to which a particular purpose is served well or poorly.

Test content that is demonstrably more difficult for one group than another should be (1) eliminated in any setting in which equal difficulty is assumed or (2) perhaps more important, the biased content should be examined closely for possible causes of the difference, leading to modification of educational practices for the low-scoring groups. Special care should be taken routinely to see that minority groups are made to feel comfortable and are not intimidated by their surroundings. Pertaining to fairness in test use,  methodological developments undermining the traditional statistical model of fairness previously accepted without question are described in some detail.

State-approved performance criteria together with individualized learning objectives will be certified by means of a localized assessment process. Teachers from local school districts and others qualified by experience would be trained as assessors prepared to enable  a candidate to receive recognition and certification of competencies wherever and whenever acquired. The time and location of learning experiences needed to prepare for such a diploma would vary with each candidate's objectives, motivations, abilities, prior experiences, and personal situation. The concept could be tested and refined over a three-year period in Syracuse and the five surrounding counties.

There is evidence to support the notion that this type of environment is not necessarily the best for maximizing the learning potential of all children. A variety of research efforts indicate that American black children and children who reside in what are commonly called Third World countries need an active environment for the most successful transfer and acquisition of knowledge. It seems to be true that our educating institutions have developed a system of teaching and learning tuned precisely to the nature and needs of white children. It also appears that certain upper income blacks--through direct interaction with the white subcultural habits, child rearing  practices, values, motives, and life styles in general--are equally successful in \"school learning\" as whites. Conformity to the white cognitive model, however, should not constitute the whole of what we should be striving for in our schools. Most importantly, child development professionals and related practitioners, by supporting the low motor model, instill fear in the hearts and minds of black mothers who would otherwise be interacting openly and freely with their babies natural behavior. Black children need all the developmental freedom they can muster. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This handbook has been prepared to stimulate and give direction to the teaching of human relations as well as to encourage a humanistic approach to teaching. It does not contain all the answers but merely offers ideas, suggestions, and information. The effectiveness of this handbook will depend on its use by teachers. It is not an end but a means to better understanding between teacher and pupil as well as between school and community. Its intent is to improve the relationship between administrators, teachers, and students. It attempts to create a desire among administrators and teachers to accept the student as an individual and is mainly concerned with the teacher-student relationship. The following are specific objectives of this handbook: (1) to create an awareness among  administrators, teachers, and students of the need for better human relations; (2) to provide practical suggestions for teachers to use in the classroom; (3) to inform administrators and teachers of the resolutions passed by the West Virginia Board of Education which relate to multicultural education; (4) to provide administrators and teachers with a means for improving communication with students; (5) to develop within teachers a better self-understanding; (6) to provide a list of organizations and agencies which make available human relations resources; and (7) to provide a recommended reading list in the area of human relations.

        "description":"In his book, &quot;I.Q. in the Meritocracy,&quot; Richard J. Herrnstein (1973) calls on a classic article by Barbara S. Burks (1928) to support his position that a large part of the variation in intelligence can be accounted for by variation in heredity, as distinguished from variation in environment, and from covariation of heredity and environment. But Herrnstein's report of the Burks study is substantially inaccurate. In Chapter Four of his book, after reviewing other empirical evidence on heritability, Herrnstein turns to the Burks study. His presentation, pages 182-184, is reproduced in this document in its entirety. Burks' study focused on adoptive families. Herrnstein cites, in particular, the low correlations of children's IQs with their adoptive parents' IQs and with environmental  variables as evidence that the role of environment is small. It is found in this document that some of Herrnstein's figures cannot be found in the Burks study, that her sample was extremely selective, that her environmental measures were limited, and that widely different estimates of heritability can be obtained from her data. Herrnstein's report cannot be taken at face value: to find out what the Burks study contains, it is necessary to read Burks. Further, the Burks study cannot support strong conclusions about the relative contributions of heredity and environment to the determination of intelligence. (Author/JM)",

A two-day open meeting or informal hearing was held on June 6 and 7, 1972, to look at two major problem areas for Puerto Ricans in Philadelphia--education for their children, and housing for their families. On June 6, teachers, students, parents, Puerto Rican community leaders, and representatives of State, and local education agencies talked about the problems Puerto Ricans encounter in the city's elementary and secondary schools. The second day, June 7, was devoted to a discussion of housing. Residents of the Spring Garden and Northeast sections  of Philadelphia covered the problems of substandard housing. They described the lack of public housing, the deteriorating conditions of most buildings, and the problems encountered by Puerto Ricans who would like to buy a home. Federal and local housing officials described various housing programs and the guidelines which must be met to secure funds for buying and rehabilitating housing. This report is based on background investigations by the field staff of the Commission on Civil Rights and the Pennsylvania State Advisory Committee, and testimony received during the open meeting.

        "description":"This curriculum guide seeks to provide teachers with a brief account of four minority groups in the United States: Afro-Americans, American Indians, Mexican-Americans, and Puerto Ricans. Because Afro-Americans consitute the largest minority group, they are dealt with more extensively than the other three groups. This curriculum guide is designed to be used by teachers in all subject areas in grades Kindergarten through 12, as they incorporate minority history and culture into the total curriculum. Teachers should not be limited by the information and sources in this publication; due to space limitations, the guide is a highlighting of events rather than a comprehensive history. There are three ways to locate information; by subject matter, by date, and by means of the  alphabetical index. To speed the location of material pertaining to Ohioans and Ohio history, a color screen has been applied to this material. This curriculum guide lends itself to a variety of teaching methods. Two of these are: (1) &quot;Present-to-past.&quot; This method capitalizes on students' awareness of current events. What is happening today is studied and discussed in relation to former events. (2) Related Events. Since no event occurs in a vacuum, teachers of various subjects can relate their discussion of inventions, scientific discoveries, artistic triumphs, great newspaper editors, to other happenings of the time period being discussed.

        "description":"This study began in 1958 as an investigation of the adjustment problems of Mexican-Americans in a highly visible barrio on the outskirts of Racine, Wisconsin. It was believed that an understanding of the process of value assimilation would explain their success or lack of success in adjusting to Anglo society. However, as we have come to see it, and as does anyone who has seen the research reports, motivation, education, and experience play a smaller part in determining how far people rise than is usually considered to be the case. When the study began, no one considered it a project encompassing the problems of people in the Negro community (Negroes were not interviewed until 1960) as well as in the Mexican-American community, nor had anyone considered the possibility of  reinterviewing everyone 10 years later, as has been done. While the research now includes the problems of both the Mexican-American and Negro communities, it also focusses on the organization of the entire city and how this organization affects the relative economic absorption and cultural integration of its most recent immigrants. The researchers now perceive the social and economic status of Mexican-American and Negro immigrants as a matter of concern to the entire community rather than as an adjustment problem of the residents of the barrio or the inner city--and a problem related to the organization of individuals.

        "description":"The general purpose of this descriptive normative survey is to discover what alternative educational programs are being provided in secondary schools in Cook County and to what extent they are attended. The general hypothesis is that relatively few alternative education programs are provided and those that are, are either the traditional, well-established vocational varieties, or those that lend themselves to close relationship with the regular academic program. The criterion data needed to test the hypothesis in this survey are basically the responses of secondary school administrators to the survey as to what alternatives were given in the form of the questionnaire sent to all Cook County suburban high school district superintendents. There are 27 secondary school districts and  one unit district in suburban Cook County. A total enrollment of 159,976 students are enrolled in the 1973-74 school year in 68 high school buildings. The Department of Research of the Educational Service Region of Cook County submitted a survey to all Cook County suburban high school districts requesting detailed information on the number of students and teachers involved in alternative education programs and on the type of programs offered. Although the results of the survey do sound promising, far more is needed to provide alternatives and options beyond the traditional school setting. Programs for students who are potential dropouts are still rather limited. (Author/JM)",

In suburban Cook County there are 27 secondary school districts and two unit districts, including Chicago. The 28 suburban secondary school districts are comprised of 68 high school buildings with a total enrollment of 159,976 students.

Each school district was contacted by letter in November 1973, requesting the mandated information on students who were removed from the school rolls.  Each quarterly district report was due on the first school day of October, January, April and July. The requested information, according to statute, includes the names of pupils, excluding transferees, who have been expelled, have withdrawn, or have left school and have been removed from the regular attendance rolls during the period of time school was in regular session since the previous quarterly report.

These Project Information Packages were to serve as vehicles for disseminating successful reading and math programs to schools where current practices are less successful. The purpose of this report is to describe the methodology used to select the successful approaches for packaging and to provide a listing of all candidate projects showing why some were rejected and others accepted. Results indicate that of the approximately 2000 approaches initially screened for this study, 136 were  selected as possible candidates for packaging. A detailed analysis of the 103 projects which forwarded evaluative and descriptive documents resulted in the selection of six projects for packaging. Over half of the candidates for this study were rejected for failure to meet the effectiveness criterion. The six projects selected for packaging clearly met all of the established criteria and provided ample evidence to support their effectiveness. Even these projects, however, had serious deficiencies in their evaluations. In all cases it was necessary to obtain and reanalyze raw test score data before firm conclusions could be drawn.

This work has been accomplished and is the subject of the present report. Four major tasks were involved in the development of Project Information Packages. They were: (1) to develop criteria for choosing operational approaches to compensatory education worthy of more widespread use and amenable to installation in other schools; (2) to design a project model and to decide, in general, what kinds of information a package should contain and what the media should be; (3) to choose up to eight compensatory education projects for packaging and develop project models for them; and (4) to prepare packages for the selected projects.

In an effort at gaining a better understanding of some of these programs, this project was directed at describing selected programs thought to be exemplary of quality, progress, trends, or problems in compensatory education and school desegregation. Because of the criteria utilized and since major problems of school desegregation are quite recent, we found more organized efforts at compensatory education than fully developed programs of school desegregation. This report  thus includes detailed descriptions of two more desegregation programs and seven compensatory education programs which were studied intensively but were not thought by our staff to merit exemplary status designation. This report is organized into four sections, including procedures, results, conclusions, and appendices.

        "description":"Plaintiffs are students enrolled in Franklin K. Lane High School, and they sue on behalf of all others similarly situated for an adjudication that their school has been so zoned as to make and keep it a segregated school in spite of its location. They moved to enjoin further enforcement of the school's zoning. The board moved for summary judgment. Both motions were denied. A hearing was set for May 5, 1972 to determine next steps. The board has sought to secure the advantage of integrated education in the face of an ever more intractible housing pattern by ingenious rezoning and an &quot;open admissions&quot; program, which in Brooklyn is not a large-scale expedient. Lane was apparently not a zone from which a student could apply. The projection for open admissions in 1972 is in the order  of 1,700 students. What emerges is a recognition of and orientation toward achieving the educational advantages of integration by striving to offset the consequence of the residential pattern without imposing undue disadvantages and hardships. The consequence, however, is that the board's school zoning is specifically advertent to the existence of racial and ethnic imbalances and to the dilution or deprivation of educational opportunity implicit in it, and in its zoning the board deals insistently and directly with the ethnic composition of the schools; where segregation in an objectively invidious sense is the result, it is &quot;de jure&quot; segregation.

        "description":"The plaintiffs are some 30 Puerto Rican and Hispanic parents and their 57 minor children who attend Public School 19 (hereinafter P.S. 19) in Brooklyn. The defendants are the members of the Community District School Board Number 14 and of the New York City Board of Education. The Community Superintendent William Rogers and Chancellor Irving Anker are also defendants. The complaint charges defendants with discriminatorily denying plantiffs an equal educational opportunity. Defendants have continually maintained split-session classes at P.S. 19 since the 1961-1962 school year. The maintenance of these classes has caused plaintiffs to lose one hour a day of education or effectively a day a week of instruction. In response to the filing of this lawsuit, six defendant members of the  Community School Board passed a resolution calling for the transfer of some of the fourth and all of the fifth grade classes to Public School 122. If defendants' plan is not enjoined, plantiffs will attend three separate elementary schools in three separate neighborhoods before entering seventh grade in a junior high school. The educators who have submitted affidavits to the Court all attest to the serious and irreparable harm that will result if the transfer is not enjoined. On June 12, 1974 the parents at P.S. 19 voted almost unanimously against the transfer. The parents favor use of the Community School District offices. (Author/JM)",

It also outlines the organizational structure, the program philosophy, and the exploratory cluster concept, which provides for students not yet ready to make a commitment to either vocational education or college preparation. Occupational guidance devices, program content, the current status of the program, projected plans, and conclusions are offered. Summarizing the benefits to member communities, the document concludes that the model has provided a practical framework for real cooperation between academic and  vocational-technical educators, and may provide the basis for a new funding design for occupational education in Massachusetts.

The health services program provides an orientation to health careers with classroom instruction and laboratory practice at the secondary level. The course presents basic health and health occupation skills. An analysis of job performances, or occupational analysis (OA), is the curriculum base, which is then translated into performance objectives, and finally sequentially grouped into developmental learning hierarchies, forming laboratory instructional units. Related  performance objectives paralleling laboratory instruction were developed by science, math, social studies, English, and foreign language teachers to produce integrated instructional units.

In order to meet the most urgent needs of this target population, Creating a Career has the following general characteristics: a curriculum-based program, an eclectic methodology, four major areas of focus (self-development, knowledge of the world of work, decision-making strategies, and job search skills), and different modes of delivery. The program is organized into nine main topics (exploring personal  roles, listening for understanding, questioning for information, setting goals, choosing an occupation, identifying job opportunities, making job applications, exploring job expectations, and handling job interviews). The various materials used are briefly described in this document and include the instructor's menaul, student book, and an occupational information system (Exploring Occupations Kit--keysort cards, indexes, other occupation information materials, and a filing guide). The remaining 30 pages of the document consist of a sample topic, Making Job Applications, from the instructor's manual. (Author/BP)",

The list of ranked knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes appropriate for ABE teachers represents the most complete list of competencies in the field to date. The timely report has been written specifically for staff development personnel, State directors of adult education, professors of adult education, competency based program designers, and directors of local ABE programs. A list of 291 ranked competencies (established by 234 ABE teachers and administrators representing 33 States) indicates which competencies should receive high and lower  order priority. Competencies have been classified by three groups: knowledge (ability to recall and recognize specifics and universals), behavior (demonstration of ability to perform), and attitude (ability to develop, receive, and respond to feelings, interests, and values). Competencies, in addition, are categorized according to: scope and goal of adult education, curriculum, ABE learner, and instructional process. The appendix includes a background of the study and the Adult Basic Education Teacher Competence Inventory, from which the ranked competencies were developed. (EA)",

Section 2 presents information on selection of instructional areas and teachers, class location, and teacher training;  student selection, enrollment, and attendance; instructional materials and methodology; evaluation techniques, awards, counseling, supportive and consultive services. Bilingual and bicultural considerations, basic education based on high interest subject matter, peer instruction, and reaching the total family unit are considered in section 3, along with evaluation techniques, attendance indications, class size, and length of courses. Sections 4 and 5 briefly discuss implications and plans for information dissemination. Appendixes present a report on teacher training workshops, forms, class visitation report, review and samples of instructional materials, and a summary of content for workshops. (NH)",

        "description":"The study analyzes the development and implementation of hometown plans in the construction industry, focusing on the efficacy of hometown negotiations in establishing new rules and institutional arrangements regarding minority hiring and training in area-wide construction systems. The procedures include analysis of published data and data collection through field interviews. The principle research findings are reported under four categories: the incidence of hometown plans; the conduct and process of hometown negotiations; the substance of hometown agreements; and the implementation of hometown solutions. The most important implications suggested by the research relate to policy, practice, and program efforts: (1) the faith of planners is discouraged by what they see as  inconsistent Federal policy, sporadic enforcement, and lack of local support; (2) the promise of increased minority employment (on a continuing basis) is unrealistic without adequate training programs, followup, and Federal surveillance (with sanctions); and (3) efforts are hampered by a lack of helpful labor-market data at a local level and by a proliferation of agencies and programs. The report includes a particular model of hometown bargaining which attempts to explain the processes involved. Field interviews were conducted in Kansas City, Rochester, New Orleans, and Oakland.

        "description":"The unemployment problem in the defense industry has often had the attention of Federal policy makers over the past several years. Analyzing this problem was accomplished by first examining the job search behavior of skilled unemployed defense workers. This search strategy differs among the unemployed workers and depends on personal characteristics such as age, sex, level of education, and prelayoff salary. In addition, the job search behavior of these individuals depends on each worker's level of specific skill and his personal valuation of the probability of recall by his former employer. The manpower policies of firms in the defense industry were next examined through an analysis of the factors which affect the individual firm's optimal stock of labor. In addition, the  influence of the displaced worker's job search strategy on the firm's management of its labor force was determined. These hypotheses were then empirically tested with data available from surveys of workers laid off by three defense firms during the years 1963-65. (Included is a three-page bibliography.)

The 180 special transcription letters comprising the document (intended for recording on the school's transcribing machines) are part of such a program, developed from objectives in an accompanying syllabus (ED 086 883), which indicates how the regular class work is systematically correlated with the required out-of-class work. A two-page guide shows how the knowledge of punctuation and English essentials should be developed on a week-by-week basis, following closely the  knowledge introduced in each letter, which is keyed to five reference works to be used by students in home-study assignments. The letters teach five different functions common to most businesses: sales and advertising, credit and collections, complaints and replies, inquiries and replies, and employment and personnel. They are graded from very easy to moderately difficult and range in length from 40 words to 400 words. (Author/AJ)",

The analysis took the form of a longitudinal study across a 10 and a half month period, with attitude measures collected at four points. It was found that, for this sample, job satisfaction measures were better able to differentiate future stayers from leavers in the earliest phase of the study. However, with the passage of time, organizational commitment measures proved to be a better predictor of turnover, while job satisfaction failed to predict turnover in these later time periods.

As a result of their study, and following several changes in the Greek government, six proposals were made to the Greek Ministry of Education. These were to: establish an independent service for adult education, equal to that for other educational levels; establish an inspectorate; reconstitute NELEs (Nomos Adult Education Committee); appoint necessary staff and provide training facilities; initiate a building program; and appoint a committee for  higher adult studies and provide resources for programs of continuing education. In the context of considering adult education as a response to the educational needs of men and women, the present Greek system of adult education is widespread but without central organization. Proposals were offered in October 1972 for reorganizing those aspects of adult education which are the responsibility of the Ministry of Education. These consisted of a refinement of and elaboration on the six proposals from the aforementioned study. (AG)",

The job scope/satisfaction with the work itself relationship was examined for the study's total sample and for subsamples created by grouping individuals on the basis of their belief in the Protestant ethic (middle-class work norms and values). Job scope may be interpreted as the degree to which a job is enriched--providing high variety, autonomy, task identity, and feedback. Satisfaction with &quot;the work itself&quot; reflects the degree to which the level of intrinsic rewards derived from a job may meet or exceed the worker's perceived equitable level of rewards. It was hypothesized and found that the job scope-work satisfaction relationship was positive and significantly different from zero for the  study's total sample and each of the three Protestant ethic subsamples. Contrary to one of the study's hypotheses, Protestant ethic did not moderate the job scope-work satisfaction relationship. The study's results were discussed in terms of their implications for theory and practice relating to job design. (Author/EA)",

        "description":"Section A of this resource guide is designed to help students develop knowledge of their personal strengths and weaknesses and understand the relationship of these characteristics to educational and vocational choices. Each time students experience a work role, they should be encouraged to share with other students: (1) their observation of job performance and job conditions, (2) personal feelings while performing or observing work, (3) personal needs they feel would be met or thwarted by such work, (4) the aptitude the students feel they might have for such work, and (5) how they think one goes about preparing for such work. This approach will result in increased understanding of work and of the self in relationship to work. Section B consists of brief descriptions of selected  natural resources occupations (air pollution control, fisheries, forestry, land use planning, mineral and mineral fuels, rangeland management, outdoor recreation, soils, water resource management, and wildlife). The usual duties, characteristics of the job, qualifications, employment prospects, and advancement opportunities are described. The three appendixes suggest related printed and audiovisual resource materials and aid in identifying community resources and occupational information. (Author)",

A lack of participation in the adult education program has created a need for revision. A questionnaire surveyed personal information, past adult education participation, respondent awareness of the program, and most suitable days for participation. Of 2,116 questionnaires mailed to heads of households, 381 were returned. Of the 590 questionnaires contracted to be delivered by the fifth grade class, 31 percent were returned by the children, while only 13 percent of the mailed questionnaires were returned. Data indicated that 27 percent of  the respondents had attended adult classes; 63 percent of the respondents had not. Monday and Tuesday appeared to be the most favorable evenings for program planning. Home improvement (gardening, home repair, landscaping, interior decorating, furniture upholstering, and furniture refinishing) was rated highest by adults. Children's interests were swimming and roller skating. Limitations of the study were the high percentage of nonrespondents, the lack of a followup to the initial request for data, and some difficulties encountered by respondents in using the questionnaire.

        "description":"A primary purpose of the study was to assess effects of an 18-week elementary school curriculum, organized around career education clusters, on student understanding of selected career education concepts. Another objective was to ascertain teacher benefits from a workshop emphasizing the cluster concept. Two experimental groups and a control group were used in the study which involved 150 fourth graders, 150 fifth graders, and 20 elementary teachers from three Independence, Missouri schools. Experimental group A was taught by teachers who had experienced an intensive career education workshop including involvement in curriculum/unit development, while experimental group B was taught by teachers attending a less intensive workshop. Pre- and posttesting consisted of administration  of the Orientation to Career Concepts, How I See Myself, Self Appraisal Inventory, and Everyday Decision Making test instruments, Achievement scores in the experimental groups were significantly higher on selected career awareness and self-awareness concepts. Moreover, scores of students, taught by teachers using self-developed units, were significantly higher on selected career awareness concepts (two out of seven cases). No significant difference was indicated for selected career decision making skills. Approximately 150 pages of the document are appendixes of workshop activities, tests, supportive data, and a related literature/research summary. (EA)",

A high percentage of Soviet prisoners, many incarcerated for ideological/religious beliefs, are confined to labor colonies. All inmates are obligated to learn a trade, one of the qualifications for release being evidence of some trade skill. Swedish institutions, leaders in humanizing efforts, offer vocational/industrial training, continuing education, and follow-up educational programs. The Finnish penal programs, although limited to elementary instruction, indicate a strong progressive strain. Education is a feature of all penal institutions in England. Of the French inmates involved in education, about one-fourth are enrolled in correspondence courses. Italy, prohibited by legislation from  organizing schools in prisons, provides vocational training. Elementary academic education is provided in Portugal, Yugoslavia, Poland, Greece, and Hungary; vocational training is emphasized in Belgium and Poland. Dutch penal staffs provide impressive group therapy experimental programs. In the United States, programed instruction and college education provision are current trends. Although a national strategy for adult basic educational training exists, General Education Development (GED) research is lacking. Vocational training, which is often provided, is weak. (EA)",

These qualitative surveys formed the basis for a more systematic analysis of the array of services to employees and to the community. The case studies examine two occupations (seafaring and the military), two countries (Japan and Israel), a special worker population (female labor force), and services in the context of five industries (a world trade corporation, hospital, bank, industrial site, and an international conglomerate). On the basis of the case studies, a method was devised for analyzing services in a more quantitative manner. The data were gathered and interpreted to reveal the social and economic conditions under which services emerge. Volume 2 offers a 63-page bibliography and  five appendixes. The first (11 pages) describes the Delaware Valley setting of the study and how the sample was drawn. The second (5 pages) discusses securing industrial cooperation. The third (13 pages) describes development of the research instrument. An evaluation of field techniques for research on complex formal organizations (13 pages) forms the fourth appendix.

Information was gathered from teachers by questionnaire; comparable data on programs in other States was obtained from a national study. Program problems and needs were explored with reference to eight types of locational settings. The study's five dimensions were: (1) demography, (2) paraprofessional aides, (3) ABE students, (4) professional preparation of teachers, and (5) the ABE program. The results of the study are based on a teacher survey return from 65 percent of all ABE teachers in Missouri (336 individuals), representing 70 of 73 ABE program sites in the  State. The data are analyzed by dimension, giving a profile of ABE for each of the program settings as perceived by teachers within the setting. A summary of the findings, and the conclusions and implications drawn from them, are presented with reference to the study's dimensions. A broad conclusion of the study is that differences did exist between program settings for many of the variables; there were also numerous variables where teacher responses across program settings were consistently similar.

The questionnaire focused on the following questions: (1) Who are the users of the service? (2) What are their reasons for continuing their education? (3) How helpful did they find the service? and (4) How can the service be improved? Of the 558 questionnaires sent, 221 usable questionnaires were returned, 40 percent of the total sample. The completed questionnaires were coded and the data analyzed by computer. The survey findings are presented in four major sections: (1) a statistical profile of users;  (2) analysis of user learning interests and reaction to telephone service; (3) cross-tabular data by user age and ethnic background; and (4) user suggestions for improving the Center's information service. The research identified a number of problem areas and the six recommendations for improving the effectiveness of the Center's telephone information service are the result.

Chapter Two, Labor Supply Response, explains the methodology by which response variables were statistically related to treatment variables and control variables; the labor supply response--mean treatment-control differentials; and labor supply response--results of more complex models. Results are tabulated and  summarized. Chapter Three presents qualifications, other findings, and further research suggestions. Data from the sample, weekly earnings, hours worked, employment rates, and percentage changes are presented in 19 tables. A list of technical papers arising from the Graduated Work Incentive Experiment and table of contents for an administrative procedures volume; abstracts of research into behavioral responses to the experiment other than the labor supply response; and an outline of the available data from the graduated work incentive experiment in New Jersey and Pennsylvania are appended.

An initial examination of existing adult education services, published in an interim report with a directory of agencies, stimulated further submissions of information from Ireland and abroad. Basic conclusions on the type of permanent structure needed were derived from assessment of the adult education provision of many statutory and voluntary bodies, the difficulties being experienced by them in the matter of resources, and the ever-increasing demands being made on them for an extension of their services. Although broad in scope, the report is thorough and detailed, and reflects the committee's determination to approach the problem scientifically and to carefully define basic  concepts. Philosophical and sociological background is provided; resources are surveyed; and fundamental, training, and special needs are identified. Proposing a structure for adult education, the committee emphasizes the concept of permanent education (continuous learning), the fragmented nature of Irish education, and the need for a definite system, framework and organization within which adult education can function and develop. Extensive and specific recommendations are made, based on the findings. (AJ)",

The report presents a comprehensive account of what was actually done and with what effect, providing the most complete and objective information obtainable, demonstrating to what degree this kind of program can achieve its goals and suggesting what improvements are needed for an even greater impact. The study compares the effects, over five years, of the program in two inner city areas with comparable control areas nearby on such variables as delinquency  rates, youth employment rates, school attendance, and adults' satisfaction with their community. The researchers conclude that the project made negligible impact on these respects, but that when boys' expectations of their eventual educational attainment were raised, their delinquency declined. Based on this finding, the researchers suggest that effective future programs will concurrently open educational and vocational opportunities and prepare youngsters to grasp them, fashioning new ways for some adolescents to be students.

It is suggested that costs be reported in a framework of the development activities and the products and subproducts of that activity. Chapter four discusses estimation of program service delivery costs. An exploratory and incremental estimate is suggested. Due to the difficulty of separating developmental from adopter activities and cost, an upper and lower  estimate is utilized. Modifications to the cost collection and reporting system of chapter three are specified. These are in the direction of providing greater detail through specification of the components which describe the processes under development. Chapters five through seven compare the accounting systems of the three Experience Based Career Education (EBCE) models with that which evolved from chapters three and four.

The instructor is urged to employ a variety of teaching strategies in the presentation of the material. A mixture of lecture, slides, show and tell, and much student  participation is encouraged. Handouts are provided which can be given to students at the end of each session. Brief annotated bibliographies appear at the end of each chapter, as well as a selected bibliography at the end of the course. The course has been designed to introduce the beginning doll collector to the techniques employed in the manufacture of old dolls, to help the novice identify a doll of excellent artistic merit, and to acquaint the collector with some of the better known names in doll making.

The survey concentrates on an investigation of the socioeconomic characteristics of jail inmates and an inquiry into the status of the nation's jails. The survey employed two distinct questionnaires--one designed to elicit directly from the authorities of each jail specific data on physical facilities, staff personnel, and programs conducted for inmates, and the other to be used by interviewers to obtain information  directly from inmates. Statistics gathered included basic demographic data, reasons for incarceration, bail status, length of pretrial confinement, length of sentence, geographical distribution of the inmates, physical data on jails, and the social and rehabilitation services offered. Tables show statistics on: socioeconomic characteristics of inmates by race, offense and confinement status; number of jails and inmates by State and the number and percent of jails with locally sponsored rehabilitative services and programs by jail size.

Questions were designed to obtain information regarding the degree of participation of inmates in such programs, the types of programs available, the previous educational attainments of the inmates, the resources available at the institutions for the educational programs, the numbers and types of training of the teachers, and the problems and needs of the institutions with regard to the education of inmates. Some information was received from 150 institutions, or 60 percent of those solicited; the geographic distribution of returns  was fairly uniform. The data obtained from the survey is presented in tabular form with comments by the researchers. It is concluded that the baseline data reflected in the survey can serve as a basis for planning educational programs, both within institutions and from without, in order to reduce recidivism.

The theoretical positions considered were two-factor, equity, instrumentality-expectancy, Cornell studies of satisfactions, and need-fulfillment. It was concluded as a result of the review that the military services have made some use of theories in job satisfaction/retention research (mostly two-factor and need-fulfillment), and use of other theoretical developments is increasing. Apparent needs consist of defining job satisfaction in the Air Force and  studying variables that may produce satisfaction/dissatisfaction.

A survey was made of the literature pertinent to the classical-human relations dimension of environmental quality. As a result, it was hypothesized that the appropriateness of the classical and human-relations master plans is moderated by at least 11 contingencies. A measure of the classical-to-human relations climate was developed and validated. Several additional hypotheses were also confirmed: (a) members generally perceive the human-relations atmosphere as more effective than the classical one, although this is much less true of supervisors than of nonsupervisors and was not true at all in some organizations; (b) supervisors tend to describe their systems' climate  as more human-relations oriented than do nonsupervisors; (c) the present climate tends to be seen as more effective by supervisors than by nonsupervisors; and (d) climates whose facets are homogeneous or consistent with regard to a classical or human-relations quality are perceived as more effective than heterogeneous climates. The results were interpreted as supporting a contingency model of organizational design. Practical implications are discussed in the final section of the concluding chapter.

Although the number of children in the population has declined, the number of children with working mothers has continued to rise. As the numbers of children in one-parent families increase, markedly higher labor force participation rates are indicated for divorced and separated women. In recent years, the most rapid gains in labor force participation rates of women have occurred among wives under age 35, and especially among those with children under six years of age. From 1969 to 1972, the proportion of black working wives with  preschool age children who worked at year-round full-time jobs increased from 26 to 41 percent. Median income for one-parent families in 1972 was $5,750 for mothers in labor force. A total of 9.2 million, or 14 percent of all children in 1972 were in families below the low-income line. Implications are the need for programs improving the mother's earnings potential and providing for adequate child care. (EA)",

The barbiturate sample differs significantly from the control sample in that barbiturate users are disproportionately represented in the North-Northeast and Far West-Pacific Coast enlistment areas; they more often indicate no religious preference; and they enlist at a younger age. Degree of barbiturate use is negatively associated with aptitude, educational level, and with measures of success in the Air Force.

Coverage of the garnishment law, an explanation of garnishment, wages subject to garnishment, and restrictions on the garnishment amount are outlined and illustrated. The effect of the Federal law on State laws, procedural requirements in State laws, garnishment before judgment, exemption for State-regulated garnishments, protection against discharge, and the limits of discharge provisions are explained. Conditions under which an individual's earnings are subjected to garnishment and enforcement of the garnishment law also are outlined.

The project had as its objectives: (1) the identification and validation of occupational teacher competencies, (2) the provision of across-the-board occupational teacher education, (3) the preparation of occupational teachers to work with the disadvantaged and handicapped, (4) the consideration of different abilities and levels of motivation so that self-paced learning can evolve, (5) the preparation of graduates of two-year vocational programs to teach, and (6) the provision of inservice teacher education. The project is summarized in the document, and the results of the project's fourth phase (implementation and operation  with juniors, seniors, and beginning teachers) are reported. The staff concluded that the program operation was consistent with general objectives for the project. A program profile is drawn, recounting policy, recruitment procedures, course syllabi, and placement procedures. Followup data pertaining to the first 16 graduates of the program are offered; the researchers conclude that the followup system works successfully, but that the small number of graduates limits the usefulness of the first data obtained by the system. Six concluding remarks are presented, aligning with the six general objectives. (AJ)",

Additional emphasis is given to environmental quality, consumer information, energy conservation and management, improving the productivity and  viability of agriculture and the wise use of natural resources.

Jobs occupying positions of less status, i.e., technical-vocational and unskilled, are mentioned (1) less frequently, (2) less realistically, (3) less positively, and (4) less emphatically than professional and paraprofessional work modes. When the comparisons were made by publisher and grade level, it was discovered that the same kind of bias existed in some grade levels and with some publishers. Each textbook was analyzed in terms of (1) quantitative bias--frequency of reference made to each work  mode--and (2) qualitative bias--a contextual evaluation of each reference to a work mode. The basic instrument employed in the study was the Hollingshead \"Two Factor Index of Social Position,\" employing seven different groupings of occupations in a continuum of low-to-high status. The analytical methodologies employed in this study were chi-square, goodness of fit, and contingency analysis. The body of the text is made up of tables substantiating the research findings. (MW)",

Based on a specific theory of how jobs affect employee motivation, the JDS is intended to: (1) diagnose existing jobs to determine if (and how) redesigning could improve employee productivity and satisfaction; and (2) evaluate the effect of job changes on employees--whether the changes derive from  deliberate &quot;job enrichment&quot; projects or from naturally occurring modifications of technology or work systems. The JDS has gone through three cycles of revision and pre-testing. Reliability and validity data are summarized for 658 employees in 62 different jobs in seven organizations who have responded to the revised instrument. Two supplementary instruments are also described: (1) a rating form for assessing &quot;target&quot; jobs; and (2) a short form of the JDS. All instruments and scoring keys are appended.

        "description":"The first of a series, this report describes a 10-year followup study of a sample of 44 graduates of the Sloan School of Management, analyzing the interaction of personal values and career events in the lives of managers in organizations. All 44 participants were located, interviewed, and given the same attitude surveys as in the early 1960's. This particular report deals with those results pertaining to the \"career anchor\" concept, a motivational/attitudinal/value syndrome which guides and constrains an individual's career and reflects both individual and societal influences. Five basic career anchors were defined from the point of view of participants in the study: (1) managerial competence, (2) technical/functional competence, (3) organizational security, (4) creativity, and  (5) autonomy. Although formal titles or career paths may appear overtly similar, important differences may exist in the anchors of career occupants. Classification into career anchor groups was on the basis of reasons for career choice, reasons for job moves, and objectives in life. The concept of career anchor was found to be a viable categorization method. Implications for the concept of career anchors are the early identification of these syndromes and the creating of congruent career opportunities. (EA)",

Second, the council suggests additions to the proposed Adult Education Act of 1974 concerning program administration, organization, funding, and training. Third, the council reiterates its recommendations for 11 other areas of adult education legislation. Fourth, the council presents a model resolution for the bicentennial year and proposes the adoption of a similar resolution by all States, the District of Columbia, and territories. Fifth, tables are presented which were taken from reports and studies made during the year. Data pertain to adults, 16 years or older, in the  United States, who have not completed high school and are not enrolled in school. Tables are divided into categories of grade level completed, race, age, sex, native language, income, and employment. Other selected facts and figures are also cited. Finally, council organization and membership are outlined. Further breakdowns of tables on students and how they relate to adult education programs and comment on adult education programs are included in the appendixes. (AG)",

Emphasis is on the learner with a diminishing of learner dependency on teachers and schools. The ideal concept would take the form of education permanente. Some signs that the open school may be significant for our times are: the impact of population and knowledge explosions, increased need for retraining/re-education, special needs of minority groups, competency recognition, and the dissaffection of learners with conventional schooling. A comprehensive open school model is the proposed  Wisconsin Open School, which will create a corollary system of education for all the people of the State, cradle-to-grave, and will be meshed with existing State educational systems. It will involve: a system of uniform transferability of credit; learning resources and communications resource centers; a laboratory approach; a lifelong curriculum; program teams, delivery systems, access systems, local advisors, counselors, and community volunteers. A &quot;once and future&quot; school, the Wisconsin Open School is designed to be self-renewing, generating new models and fresh applications. (EA)",

In order to attain these objectives the system must be capable of eliciting, interpreting, and analyzing learner goals; it should embody two separate but related programs--instructional and learning; participation should be  free of traditional academic entry requirements and rewards; learning objectives and evaluation should provide the basis for decision making; the system must be cost effective; all available media should be employed; testing and evaluation should diagnose and analyze the accomplishment of specified learning objectives; independence in learning should be encouraged; the environment must be learner-oriented; and learning must return to being a natural and continuing activity.

The four major outcomes set for the workshop participants were: (1) understanding the nature and design of the ABLE (Authentic Basic Life-Centered Education) Model Program, the OCCUPAC Project, and the Career Development for Children Project; (2) selecting implementation strategies for installing elements of the three curricula in local schools; (3) selecting a plan for articulating elements of the  three curricula with the total education program in their schools; and (4) selecting demonstrated teaching techniques which could be used in a local shool program. An evaluation team of workshop participants was formed for each workshop. Participant comments indicated enthusiasm for the workshop approach and encouragement for beginning the implementation of career education programs in their schools.

The modules are: (1) forces giving impetus to career education; (2) identification of concepts, issues, problems, and trends in career education; (3) analysis of acceptance of career education; (4) study of operational career education models; and (5) development of techniques and materials for teaching career education. The first four modules are studied as background for the  final module, and it is expected that at least half of the effort of this study will be expended in achieving the competencies for the final module. Each module includes an outline rationale, prerequisites needed, a preassessment, enabling objectives for the module, a discussion of the module concept and the issues which should be considered, learning alternatives for the student, and a postassessment.

Two kinds of advisory councils are: one whose duty is to review the total system-wide curriculum, facilities, and local manpower needs; or a second, of more limited function, composed of business and industrial men and women familiar with job requirements and able to update curriculum in vocational areas to assure entry-level job skills for students. Objectives and priorities for a council should be clearly defined by the local board of education. Membership should reflect the occupational  possibilities in the community and members should be selected from those who have demonstrated an interest in education and the ability to organize and direct volunteer groups. After an initial goal-setting meeting the council must determine its own organization, subcommittee assignments, subcommittee operation, coordination of activities, and relationship with the board of education and staff.

Through mulitple regression techniques, the characteristics sought by the Oakland (California) Police Department testing process between 1965 and 1971 are defined. The probability of success is greatly increased as years of education increase, and is also raised by previous police experience and high previous wages. It is decreased by minority group status and local residence.

        "description":"The Fifth Annual Evaluation of Vocational Education in Nebraska, prepared by the Nebraska Advisory Council for Vocational Education for the Period July 1, 1973, through June 30, 1974, reviews progress and makes recommendations in the areas of four State priorities and three major goals: (1) State goals and priorities, (2) serving people and their needs, and (3) the extent to which previous recommendations have received due consideration. The first section considers a concept of career education; existing facilities and services in meeting vocational education needs; limiting factors to the growth of vocational education; vocational education and the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973; and the responsibilities of secondary and postsecondary vocational education. The  second section presents vocational student activities; local vocational education advisory committees; priorities for development of professional personnel for vocational education; serving the disadvantaged; and placement of vocational education program completions. The third section discusses action taken on previous Council recommendations and notes areas where significant accomplishments were recorded. Data on vocational education teachers, placement, employment, and enrollment status are presented in four tables. An 11-item bibliography and appendixes on vocational education enrollments and total expenditures conclude the report. (NH)",

        "description":"Numerous societal changes have encouraged the marked increase in second careers for people in general and for those over 35 in particular, raising implications for both career development and vocational decision-making. A developmental model needs to be realigned with new developmental strategies for the middle years. Research literature has suggested that most people undergo a midlife crisis--a reaction to the onset of aging and a reawakening to unresolved problems and/or career decisions. Recent research studies have shown higher achievement values and motivations for candidates for second careers than noncandidates and a high proportion of second-career candidates having a low degree of autonomy on their jobs. Moreover, vocational decision-making at midlife has been found more  complex, &quot;soul-rending&quot;, and fearsome than at other stages. The role of this Commission needs to be threefold: educational, collaborative, and creative. Recommended collaboration includes the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges, the Adult Education Association, the National Institute of Education, and the military. Recommendations for creativity include: radio and television materials; career education-placement agencies in cooperation with labor and industry; research pertaining to counseling/assessment skills, models, and/or autobiographies of people changing careers; publications and regional meetings; training of personnel; focus on problems of women.

Bruce Dearing examines personal, human questions posed by maturing individuals and indicates how they present challenges for a lifetime learning process. Bentley Glass discusses two aspects of lifelong learning. A statistical overview of the economy indicating an increasing demand for workers in their middle years is presented by Herbert Bienstock. Eli Ginzberg outlines costs to the society and the individual in establishing new work patterns for the middle years. Costs in relation to investment in human capital are examined by Victor Fuchs, and Samuel Conner discusses the concept of midcareer change  in relation to an individual's personal and financial needs. Bernard Bellush describes the activities of a union to promote work satisfaction and career flexibility; F. Bruce Hinkel reports on the work of a corporation to reach the same goals. Ruth VanDoren discusses the changing nature of careers and education; Betty Roberts addresses the voluntary occupational change of middle-aged people. Designing new work patterns for women which could be applied throughout the economy is discussed by Felice Schwartz. In the concluding presentation, John Toll comments on the design of new work-learning relationships. (Author/AG)",

Five hospitals, representing a variety of types, cooperated in the study. The research design included a primary care questionnaire, visits to the hospitals, analysis of standards, interviews, and recommendations. Data is tabulated and findings summarized. The summaries reinforce earlier findings in that the more skilled professional (i.e., the RN and LPN) spends large amounts of time on tasks which require very little skill, while persons in entry-level occupations in  fact perform some of the more sophisticated functions. Research findings related to marginal medical functions and health manpower employment are discussed, the progress of the general work of the Center for Medical Manpower Studies reported on, and future plans presented.

The three terms imply a progressive narrowing of purpose. The goals of career education are to make work possible, meaningful, and satisfying. Vocational education--skill acquisition--is a major part of the bedrock of career education. Integration requires academic teachers to recognize preparation for work as a basic goal of American education, and vocational teachers must find and emphasize the commonality of purpose in education that binds them with all other educators. The basic problem career  education asks today's vocational educators to face is the problem of deciding to change; there are two basic choices: one would be to emphasize vocational education as preparation for primary work goals, abandoning the traditional criterion that it should lead to gainful employment and making industrial arts, home economics, agriculture, and experiences for the \"college-bound\" a basic part of vocational education. The other choice would be to label the field \"occupational education.\" Mutual dependence requires change in both fields. (Author)",

        "description":"This study was concerned with the identification of the job dimension underlying the job elements of the Position Analysis Questionnaire (PAQ), Form B. The PAQ is a structured job analysis instrument consisting of 187 worker-oriented job elements which are divided into six a priori major divisions. The statistical procedure of principal components analysis was used to identify the job dimensions of the PAQ. Forty-five job dimensions were identified through eight separate component analyses of a sample of 3,700 PAQ analyses which had been stratified roughly in proportion to the occupational composition of the American labor force. These job dimensions accounted for a substantial portion of the variance associated with the data, the percentage ranging from 51 percent to 63 percent  for the several component analyses performed. The 45 job dimensions which were identified might be viewed as representing groups of job elements which tend to occur together on jobs, and, since the sample on which these analyses were performed was stratified in proportion to the occupational composition of the labor force, these job dimensions would be relatively representative of the groupings of such job characteristics of jobs in general.

        "description":"The study involved the use of a structured job analysis instrument called the Position Analysis Questionnaire (PAQ) as the direct basis for the establishment of the job component validity of aptitude tests (that is, a procedure for estimating the aptitude requirements for jobs strictly on the basis of job analysis data). The sample of jobs used consisted of 658 jobs for which PAQ analyses were available that were &quot;matched&quot; with 141 jobs for which the United States Training and Employment Service had published test data for job incumbents for the nine tests of the General Aptitude Test Battery (GATB). Job dimension scores were derived for the 658 jobs and were used as predictors. The criteria were developed for each of the 141 &quot;matched&quot; jobs based on the scores of the job  incumbents on the nine tests: (1) mean test score; (2) a score one standard deviation below the mean (called a potential cutoff score); and (3) a validity coefficient. The results generally supported evidence from previous studies that data based on a structured job analysis procedure can be used for establishing the job component validity of aptitude tests, thereby eliminating the need for conventional test validation procedures in many situations.

Comprehensive career education programs are divided into phases: self-awareness and career awareness, career exploration, and preparation for job placement. Programs begin at the kindergarten level and extend through adult and continuing education; the phases are recycled according to individual needs and wants. The long-range goal is economic independence and personal satisfaction for the individual as he assumes his various roles in life. In the Warren program, personnel needs were surveyed, and meetings to plan objectives for students and staff were held. Instructional materials were developed according to eight guidelines and followed the USOE  occupational clusters division. The purpose of each unit of instruction at each grade level was specified, and, pending official publication of external evaluators, it is felt program objectives were accomplished. The 125 pages of appendixes contain related material: objectives, forms, surveys, and three examples of instructional units (Family Members as Producers and Consumers, 16 pages; Occupations in National Resources, 55 pages, and Occupations in the Stock Market, 30 pages).

These are viewed as one policy set to analyze their incentives and disincentives to see if the incentive structure is consonant with a goal of promoting work. Sanctions applied to recipients are also analyzed. Relatively high benefits are found to result in higher reliance on sanctions than on incentives. Training programs targeted at the welfare poor are more sanctions than effective training. Implications for the U. S. are: (1) training programs for welfare recipients can easily degenerate into ineffectiveness, except as sanctions; (2) the experimentation now possible under Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) is an opportunity to devise  structures in which incentives and sanctions are consonant with the goal of promoting employment, and in which training programs for welfare recipients feed into and are part of the mainstream of general manpower policy, so that they can do an effective training job.

        "description":"The study was conducted in Texas on a sample of 778 students to develop a process for administrative decision-making related to modifying or redirecting educational programs through collection and analysis of followup data obtained by questionnaires sent to former students. The document deals with a comparison of former students who took vocational courses and those who did not, when occupational choice occurred, and the effect of selected factors (academic/vocational courses, teachers, chance, etc.) on occupational choice. Opening sections of the document are devoted to a seven and one-half page review of literature and descriptions of the study's purpose, objectives, and its methodology. The major section of the document presents an analysis of data gathered from former  vocational-technical students and non-vocational-technical students. Data related to student responses and hypotheses in the areas of job satisfaction, basic skills and technical knowledge, effectiveness of facilities and equipment, effectiveness of instructors, and personal services provided by high schools are tabulated and discussed. A summary, nine conclusions, and seven recommendations conclude the document. A suggested model for evaluating vocational-technical programs, a 38-item bibliography, and the questionnaire form are appended. (NH)",

This report provides a descriptive profile of ABE teachers and students and analyzes factors determining student enrollment, attendance, and program completion. An exploratory search, the study assesses the relationship of situational, dispositional, and program factors to participation stages of enrollment, attendance, and separation. Situational factors were those variables existing in the life situation of adults that hindered or encouraged participation, while dispositional variables were those existing in the minds of adults. Program factors referred to ABE program aspects which reduced or encouraged participation. Research populations tapped were: a sample of ABE  participants compared with a similar sample of eligible, non-enrolled adults; State attendance information of adults currently participating in ABE programs; interviews with adults separated from the program during the preceding three years. It was found that the enrollment rate of Mexican Americans and blacks was greater than their expected proportionate enrollment, but attendance and program completion were lower than for Anglos. Minority adults seem to experience more obstacles than Anglos in ABE participation. Inducement items significantly related to completion were those indicating satisfaction with one's progress or perceived achievement in ABE. (EA)",

Purposes of the program, partially funded by Title 1 Higher Education Act of 1965, were: (1) to assist senior citizens in making better use of their leisure time, (2) to impart or improve skills which the senior citizens might use to supplement their income. The program which was administered by Southwestern State College consisted of approximately 15 seminars and/or activities of interest in areas of arts and crafts, recreation, and health. Presentations were scheduled on-campus, in a nursing home, and in senior citizens' homes via cable television. The 343 enrollees preferred skill-oriented courses over  knowledge-oriented courses. The concentrated effort of community service agencies, civic leaders, and the academic institution was vital to program success. It was found to be important that senior citizens identify with the program in an active role of planning and conducting the program. Participants did not have the need to attain academic degrees; preference was for an opportunity to leisurely pursue subjects of their own choice.

This type of education benefits the school by providing a cooperative atmosphere as well as a basis for educational accountability. Society benefits from career development education through a socialization process smoothing the transition from school to career. Nine operational principles must be kept in mind to achieve the goal of making each individual competent in developing  and managing his career life. They involve organization, flexibility, orientation, individualization, content, school role, and scope. The objectives, nature, and activities for career development education are established according to levels from elementary through adult.

First, an Adult Informal Reading Test (AIRT) was administered, scored and interpreted by the project team. These results and guidelines for the advancement of adults in reading materials were communicated to cooperating project teachers, who then conducted the test with a nationwide sample of adults. The tests were scored and interpreted by the project team. Although the national test population was less than half the desired number, it seemed consonant with national statistics collected at the same time. Several areas of investigation led to inconclusive results because of the decline in the sample population size, but it was determined that the project did not succeed in  identifying an instructional placement level through the use of the AIRT. Changes in word recognition, accuracy, rate and comprehension of material read orally among adults with similar instructional programs and AIRT pre-test scores varied. It was concluded that the AIRT must still be used primarily as an instrument to measure specific reading performances.

        "description":"The Air Force uses a standardized costing methodology for resident technical training schools (TTS); no comparable methodology exists for computing the cost of on-the-job training (OJT). This study evaluates three alternative survey methodologies and a number of cost models for estimating the cost of OJT for airmen training in the Administrative Specialty (702X0) from the 1-level (helper) to the 3-level (semi-skilled). The final costing methodology selected for use in the next phase of this research effort can easily be adapted to other Air Force specialties and skill levels. The quality of OJT and TTS graduates is compared according to several criteria, and the evidence indicates that neither type of training is superior to the other for the Administrative Specialty. The cost  per graduate of OJT for this specialty was estimated to be significantly below the cost of TTS. However, it is important to consider other factors in addition to cost prior to drawing any inferences concerning the optimal OJT/TTS mix. The effect of these factors is discussed at length in this report. (Author)",

        "description":"Military and civil service personnel having similar job types and from comparable accounting and finance career ladders were compared on several attributes. The data reveal certain distinct differences between the two populations with the magnitude of the differences being highly variable as functions of specific job types considered. Generally, civilians perform a larger number of tasks, the tasks and overall jobs they perform are more difficult, they find their jobs more interesting, and feel that their jobs make greater use of their talents and training. In view of these differences in attributes and the potentially higher cost of military personnel, conversion of certain military positions to civilian positions to meet operational needs appears feasible. Unique attributes of  civilian and military personnel also point out the necessity for further research into their causes and consequent effects in such areas as promotion, skill upgrading, career progression, worker attitudes, and retention. The need for investigation appears more critical for the airmen population because of their expressed job dissatisfaction, particularly those performing disbursement accounting functions where simple highly repetitive tasks tend to predominate.

About 3.9 million American workers (4.5 percent of all employed persons) held two or more jobs at the same time in May 1974. About 22 percent of all moonlighters had at least one agricultural job. The decrease in moonlighting was primarily due to the sharply lower multiple jobholding rate for men, especially those in prime working ages, and married men. The decline in multiple jobholding among men was widespread by occupation and industry. Men whose primary jobs were as teachers below the college level or as protective service workers had, as usual, the highest moonlighting rates, 17 and 11 percent, respectively. By industry, men whose main jobs were in educational services and in public administration  in State and local governments had the highest rates, 12 percent each, reflecting the high rates for teachers and protective service workers, such as police and fireworkers. Four tables support the data analysis. (Author/MW)",

A format for a certificate program in Texas is proposed which synthesizes the strengths of programs in the other two States. Three alternative plans for implementation of the certificate program are offered for consideration: a Statewide coordinated program, a decentralized program, and maintenance of the status quo for the continuing education director who has already established a viable real estate program which is meeting the needs of his local community.

The main body of this monograph provides an operational approach to meeting these two needs. It outlines steps which a local school district can follow in conducting an evaluation of its career education effort. A longer term result of following these steps would be the accumulation of information necessary to determine the extent to which the objectives associated with the concept have been achieved; that is, the baseline data for determining whether or not these are individual attributes which  should be fostered. If the framework provided is followed and the results are shared with USOE, it is expected that both local needs for assessment and national needs for policy information and further theoretical development will be met.

Providing a prototype for delineating program impact, the basic components of a delivery system model are described: (1) policy establishment and decision making; (2) development, organization, and management of curriculums; (3) identification and recruitment of persons into training programs; (4) diagnostic  procedures for identifying and assessing individual problems; (5) supportive services; and (6) program evaluation strategies and techniques. Program impact is discussed in relationship to policy, curriculum strategies, identification and recruitment strategies, diagnostic procedures, supportive services, and program evaluation strategies. A brief summary of projects by States shows the diversity of programs. Finally, recommendations are proposed focusing on the need for more programs for the disadvantaged and handicapped, personnel training, the development of an individualized instruction program, and the need to develop guidelines for interagency cooperation.

According to a review and analysis of available data, schools at all levels are operating separate vocational education programs for women. Limiting girls to traditional, female-intensive offerings perpetuates and contributes to restricted job opportunities and lower earnings for women graduates. Although women comprise 55.5 percent of total vocational education enrollments and two-thirds of all secondary vocational enrollments, they are concentrated in non-wage-earning home economics and in health and office occupations, fields in which they are most prevalent in the world  of work. Findings related to current status of women in the world of work, of vocational-technical education for females, sexism in society and education, and staff related problems for women in education are tabulated and discussed. Affirmative Action for women in education is reviewed in the light of Federal legislation. Implications for change and recommendations are presented, and an appendix lists availability of regulations and guidelines for Affirmative Action. (MW)",

The 12 years of manpower training legislation from MDTA to the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) of 1973 and a parallel chronology of legislative history of vocational education since 1963 is analyzed in chapter 1 and the diversity of current interpretations and definitions of career education discussed. The following section deals with group impressions of manpower training issues related to evaluation, training, and the need for national interagency coordination. The third section examines the mixed perceptions and attitudes of  vocational educators toward the status of vocational education and manpower training. Examining Project Baseline data and information, conclusions and recommendations of the 1972-73 reports are summarized. The report concludes that vocational education and manpower training and development are not antithetical and competitive; they are compatible and both are dedicated to the same objective of training in the nation's policy for manpower.

The intent is to define the great American enterprise of vocational education and to identify its strong and weak components. Following this survey is a discussion of the state of the art in vocational education and  manpower information systems. This forms a necessary prelude to an analysis of the impact of vocational education and manpower training on the labor market, and to the conclusions of the report.

Employing a 2 (victim vs. defendant description) X 2 (similarity vs. dissimilarity of attitudinal information) X 2 (male vs. female respondent) design, it was found that in a rape case males attribute more guilt to a defendant who is similar to themselves, as opposed to one dissimilar; females attribute more guilt to a victim when the defendant is described as similar as opposed to dissimilar to themselves.

In developing such a program, Denmark developed a number of innovations concerned with preventive care programs for children. The program has changed from its beginnings in 1888, and since 1964 has offered voluntary family guidance to any family with children under 18. Implementing the program is the responsibility of the local districts, or &quot;Kommunes,&quot; which explains the considerable variation in the quantity and quality of the services in different parts of the country. A &quot;family helper&quot; is assigned families who need long-term help in resolving family-child problems, and the helper usually spends six months to one year working with the family until the situation has  stabilized. Families are serviced primarily on a crisis basis when it is felt that nonintervention would permit permanent damage to the quality of the children's environment. The three general types of services offered by family guidance are referral, economic assistance, and group services or parent clubs. (Author/PC)",

It deals largely with the issue of limitations imposed on individuals by virtue of their sexuality. The author maintains that rather than recognizing the duality of human existence wherein both sexes have what are called masculine and feminine impulses, we have forced each sex to specialize and cultivate only one set of characteristics and deny the other. This makes for alienation within the individual and polarizes the sexes, making communication between them more difficult. The author concludes that it will require active  efforts to effect attitude changes that lead to cooperation between women and men, and among people, to overcome the barriers that have for so long existed.

Subjects were placed in an ambiguous face-to-face situation in which an accomplice agreed with the subject on 7 of 14 attitude issues. The personality variables of interest were Spielberger's (1966) state-trait anxiety measures and the Marlowe-Crowne (1964) scale of social desirability. In the context of attraction toward neutral strangers, anxiety and social desirability were expected to have quite different, in fact, complementary, effects. Specifically, two hypotheses were advanced: (1) that  high anxiety would be related to disliking others and enhanced recall for disagreements; and (2) that high social desirability would be associated with liking others and heightened recall for agreements, when the proportion of attitude agreements-disagreements was constant. Results supported both hypotheses. Neutral interactions elicited very different affective reactions from high anxiety and high need for approval subjects despite the fact that proportion of attitude agreements was constant. Anxiety and social desirability apparently influenced interpersonal attraction by promoting selective perception in an ambiguous social situation. (Author)",

This program directly links separate social institutions--the schools and the mental hospitals--in a plan for unified services to one group of children. The program is defined as a transitional resource intended to prepare these students for long-term placement in regular or special education classes. The goals are to improve social functioning and to provide academic remediation. Although the children are severly disturbed and many of their families are so helpless and disorganized that placement of a large percentage of them is a real consideration, the program has  demonstrated that many of these children can attend school regularly, can improve their behaviors dramatically, and can learn. The authors present a description and progress report in order to highlight some of the successes and failures of the program. (Author/PC)",

The latter section of the text relates suggestions on what can be done by parents and others who are concerned about alcohol  abuse, and offers a set of specific rules for parents who want to teach their children how to drink.

The clinics have shown that adequate medical care can be provided at minimal cost utilizing nonprofessional, paraprofessional, and professional staff. There are four basic types of clinics in existence: neighborhood clinics, street clinics, youth clinics, and sponsored clinics.

Myths and facts about women workers are explored and discounted. The author holds to the position that men are male, women are female, and jobs are neuter. The first step toward full utilization of women in all fields is a frank evaluation of the attitudes of organizational leadership toward more women in top-level middle-management positions, and women in nontraditional job areas. The second step is the provision of opportunities for training and advancement toward that goal. Special consideration is given to the role of women in the military, and the author points out that all the services have announced  programs to achieve wider utilization across the full spectrum of noncombat jobs. Women now being recruited are either already qualified for technical jobs or capable and interested in being trained for them. In the military, drawbacks exist for women with children in that they are expected to resolve family responsibilities and may not expect favored treatment on the basis of being a mother. The author expresses optimism about the commitment of women in professional life and their willingness to help others join the ranks of the employed. (Author/PC)",

Additional data were collected on personal and academic characteristics, educational goals, and problems encountered. Major findings indicated that 41 percent of the sample were employed and that 76 percent attended day classes. Fifty-five percent of the women were enrolled in career-oriented curricula with a grade-point average of 3.06. Home responsibility and adequate study time were listed as the major problems in returning to school. There were significant differences in demography, use and need for counseling services between age groups (25-32, 33 and older). Conclusions from the study indicated that mature women had positive attitudes toward  counseling and instructional services; however, the younger group tended to make greater use of student personnel services. Recommendations include: (1) publicizing opportunities for mature women in career counseling, transfer procedures, and financial aid; (2) attracting more mature students through well developed adult counseling programs; and (3) focusing further research on the relationship of mature womens' realistic goals, curricula, and the job market.

It also compared the significance of the self-concept in incarcerated and nonincarcerated juvenile delinquents. Two experimental groups received eight weeks of group counseling once a week for three hours, and were compared to two control groups on a pre-posttest of the Tennessee Self Concept Scale (TSCS). An analysis of the effects of group counseling indicated that none of the self-concept variables significantly distinguished the counseled groups. However, the following trends were noted: (1) the experimental group had 71 percent of the most positive self-concept changes; (2) there were no differences between the  nonincarcerated experimental and control group as to the amount of most positive self-concept changes; and (3) the incarcerated experimental group had slightly more positive self-concept changes than did the nonincarcerated experimental group.

Nonacademic behaviors included quantified teacher ratings on a five-point scale of 12 variables including attention span, following directions, working hard for approval, emotional control, peer popularity, and friendliness. Results from the correlations identified the neurological \"soft signs\" most consistently related to academic/intellectual measures; these included combined hand, foot, and eye dominance, and tongue dysdiadochokinesia. Measures least related to  academic performance involved both hand and feet tapping speed and bilateral hand tremor. Causal effect analysis of the findings suggest that \"Neurological impairment\" does not represent any sort of entity with specific educational relevance, and raises the possibility that further study of the relationship between neurologic variables and their relevance for educational planning may be a direction worthy of additional exploration.

The author relates his personal experiences as a consultant to a police department, and outlines several steps to promote and maintain effectiveness within the agency. Mutual respect and a willingness to become a good listener become key components to acceptance within the force. In opening up a line of communication, the consultant must demonstrate to his charges a willingness to take many of the risks which they do. This active involvement in police routine serves two purposes: (1) it helps the consultant develop a sense of confidence in the men with whom he is expected to work; and (2) he is able to gain first hand insight into the problems a  policeman encounters in his work. At no time should consultation and psychotherapy become confused. The psychologist must not provide therapy when his contact calls for consultation. A psychological consultant can render an invaluable service by augmenting the effectiveness of policemen in problems ranging from community relations to domestic affairs. (PC)",

Data were collected from male and female employees at a major midwestern university in three occupational groups--faculty, academic-professional, and nonacademic. Inter- and intra-role conflict data were collected using the following set of response measures: (1) Kahn's job-related tension index, (2) three questions asking the person to judge how much conflict he or she feels between simultaneous demands on their time, (3) a set of questions relating how people divide their time on a typical work day and weekend, (4) the Job Descriptive-Index, and (5) the General Motors Faces Scale. Results appear to dispel the myth that women have more inter-  and intra-role conflict than men. The female sample spent less time at work and in family role activities than the professional men, and more time on personal activities and home maintenance. They perceived no more career-family responsibility conflict than the men did, but they did see their careers as interfering with keeping up their homes. In their jobs, the women perceived no more job-related tension than the men. They were significantly less involved with their jobs and were particularly dissatisfied with their opportunities for promotion. The female sample appears to have its multiple career and family roles suprisingly well synchronized. (Author/PC)",

Based on causal attribution theory, an interview procedure was designed to systematically control behavioral information assumed to be utilized by individuals in inductively arriving at views of their personal characteristics. It was hypothesized that greater acceptance of an interviewer's inference about an interviewee's personal characteristics will occur when (1) the inference is based on normatively deviant action rather than when it is based on normatively average action, and (2) the inference is based on a review of several consistent actions rather than when it is based on an analysis of a single action. The hypotheses were tested by  examining changes in self-ratings of assertiveness by 60 college males. Subjects' ratings were made immediately before and after a simulated counseling interview which focused on an analysis of each subject's actions in an arranged social conflict situation. Results indicated that an inference based on a single action was highly persuasive (p=.002); neither the perception of deviancy nor of consistency of performance significantly added to acceptance of the inference.

It reviews the pharmacology of the drug as well as physiological and psychological effects, patterns of use, and adverse effects (toxicity and poisoning). It examines the success rates of inpatient and ambulatory detoxification programs, and, in addition, establishes many differing viewpoints on the success of methadone maintenance. Generally, detoxification programs have not been overly promising, and maintenance programs have varied in their success. The report presents negative opinions about the use of methadone, ranging from cautious criticism to total opposition, in addition to a bibliography. (Author/PC)",

        "description":"Clients enter counseling with expectations regarding what counseling will be like. It is widely believed that effectiveness of counseling is closely linked with these expectancies. This study was designed to determine the degree to which college students actually possess such expectations and to investigate the relationship of their expectations to their sex and college class. A questionnaire regarding expectations for counseling was given to 287 students and included 24 questions dealing with the subject's expectancies regarding his own behavior in counseling, and 64 statements concerning the subject's expectations about how the counselor would behave during counseling. Results suggested that subjects indicated an expectation that counseling in general could be helpful, they  expressed doubt that it could ever be helpful to them, personally. Results also indicated that the longer students remained in college, the less they anticipated contact with an expert, accepting counselor. Findings were consistent with those of Apfelbaum (1958) in that females expected the counselor to be accepting and nonjudgemental while males anticipated a more directive and critical counselor.

Those patients who had the largest discrepancy between their expected and actual length of hospitalization (the largest ERDs) tended to improve the least while hospitalized. Improvement did not appear to be related to whether a patient was discharged sooner or remained longer than he expected. (Author)",

Results of the survey of transportation needs indicated that bus service for food shopping was a high transportation priority among the elderly. The third study analyzed the interrelationship of special problems, programs, and responses to resources available for the elderly. Persons responded favorably to living in a Title III public housing facility that provided supportive services to aid independent living. The basic theme in all  three studies was that the community was responsible for providing support services to encourage senior citizens to remain independent and to be an integral part of the community.

Before- and after-training as well as post-check observations were made of two groups of cottage workers as they worked with retarded youths on a social (fine-taking) and maintenance (sink-cleaning) task. The results of the multiple baseline design used indicated that the training effectively increased the groups' use of \"teaching interaction\" skills. However, the increases observed for the groups were not representative of the  majority of the data for individual trainees and specific teaching skills. In addition, long term post-checks indicated a slight decline in the groups' data. An on-the-job retraining, monitoring, and feedback system is suggested (and is currently being experimentally investigated) as a means to remediate the deficits not handled by the initial training.

Results indicate that SAC's overall student grade point average has been increasing during the past four years at an average annual rate of 3.2 percent through the spring term, 1974. The absolute increase since fall 1970 has been 8.9 percent. There has been an 18 percent average increase in &quot;A's&quot; given and a corresponding 18 percent average decrease in &quot;C's&quot; given during the past four years. The number of withdrawals has increased 13 percent on the average during this  time period. The percentages of &quot;B,&quot;&quot;D,&quot; and &quot;F&quot; grades have remained fairly constant. This trend has skewed the college grade distribution to the left, away from the traditional &quot;normal&quot; distribution. Mean grade point average for all students has increased from 2.57 in fall 1970 to 2.80 in spring 1974. Work experience grades were found to have little effect on the rate of increase of the overall college grade point average. (Author/DC)",

        "description":"There has been rapid growth in the number of mature female students entering institutions of higher education. Increases in employment opportunities, decline in birth rate, and the impact of social reform and the feminist ideology all indicate a trend toward greater opportunities for women with increased female participation in higher education. As a student development specialist, the counselor must recognize the particular psychosocial needs of women and develop strategies to facilitate the personal growth and development of the female student. A broad base of research and discussions on the psychology and psychosocial needs of women has rapidly developed. Drawing on the research in this field, the counseling service at Virginia Western Community College has planned a course  designed to define specific sources of psychological, sociological, and situational factors which may impede the growth and development of the mature female student. Student objectives, proposed teaching methods, and a sequence of topics for the course are detailed. Desirable group dynamics and the means for course evaluation are also described. A bibliography focusing on college women is included. (Author/AH)",

        "description":"In 1973, 180 independent two-year colleges with membership in the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges (AACJC) were surveyed to determine the extent of cooperative arrangements. Forty-five colleges (25 percent) reported 207 programs of interinstitutional cooperation. In a second survey of state directors of public two-year colleges, 321 institutions reported a total of 328 programs. Overall, cooperating private colleges average four programs per institution, while cooperating public colleges average 0.9 programs per institution. For both kinds of institutions, approximately 50 percent of all programs are academic. Library, faculty, and admissions and enrollment programs comprise other important areas for the independents. Training and admissions and enrollment  programs are the other important areas for public institutions. Public college programs usually involve several institutions; independent college programs usually involve only two institutions. Both public and private colleges tend to cooperate with their two- or four-year counterparts. Cooperative programs are seen as a means of strengthening private two-year colleges without loss of autonomy, through sharing of resources in a time of fiscal uncertainty. (Author/DC)",

        "description":"This report describes post-community college activities of former occupational/technical students at 13 Virginia community colleges. The colleges identified 11,623 former students as eligible, of whom 3,433 were graduates who had earned an associate degree, diploma, or certificate. An overall response rate of 61 percent was obtained, 73 percent for graduates and 56 percent for nongraduates. The data were summarized to permit comparison of respondent groups on the basis of sex, race, graduation status, degree earned, and curriculum. The factors relating to postcollege activities included employment status, relevance of curriculum to present job, initial and present salary, extent and reasons for continuing education, reasons for withdrawal before graduation, and intention to  return to college. Greater percentages of graduates than nongraduates were employed full-time. Diploma graduates had higher rates of employment than either degree or certificate graduates. The curricular areas of public service and health showed a higher degree of job congruence than other areas. The median salary for initial jobs was $5,419 and rose to $7,158 for present jobs. Nongraduates received higher median initial and present salaries than graduates. (Author/MJK)",

Individualized instruction, open-ended courses, counseling to improve student self-concept, performance objectives, and objective evaluations are ingredients central to the program. After a review of current practices in remedial education, the Developmental Program is discussed in terms of its establishment, philosophy, and objectives. This study attempts to document the program's impact on the students in terms of improved GPA, decreased rate of withdrawal, and increase in units passed per term. Students participating in the Developmental Program were matched by skill levels with others taking  comparable regular classes. The developmental students, during fall term, passed more credit hours (7.9 compared to 5.6), had a higher overall GPA (2.30 compared to 1.20), and had a 4 percent dropout rate compared to 25 percent for the control group. Similar results were obtained in winter quarter, although discrepancies were not as large due to the higher attrition rate of control students during fall quarter. (AH)",

Twenty-five conditions common to all five colleges with respect to their handling of Federal programs are described. Additional factors present at the individual schools studied are also noted. Some of the major problems that must be dealt with when receiving Federal aid include: (1) lateness of Federal appropriations announcements which makes planning difficult; (2) grants made for a 12-month period, necessitating initiation, implementation, and completion of projects within the time period; (3) announcement of availability of funds is sometimes given on short notice, leaving little time to submit proposals; (4) once a proposal is submitted,  turn-around time until grant awards are finalized can be as long as six months; (5) many Federal agencies' staffs are not familiar with community colleges; (6) high turnover rate in Federal offices makes it difficult to establish on-going relationships with Federal program officers; and (7) difficulty in matching institutional practices with Federal fiscal and regulatory practices. The future role of Federal money in the colleges studied is speculated upon. (Author/AH)",

This report discusses the local situation, the state level, and the private sector as realistic avenues for funding. Basically, the most viable source for receiving funds from state and local sources is one of bilateral approach: the community college and a local agency or government cooperate in a common goal or activity. Resource sources on the local level include State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972 monies, city and county commissions, and regional planning agencies. State aid programs are also noted. The private sector, both on a state and local level, can be an excellent source of funds.  In 1972, there were 245 community foundations with assets of over $1 billion in the United States, with business and corporate foundations available in almost every community.

This document recommends methods of taking a hard look at the ways in which these resources are and can be utilized. The budgeting structure must be thoroughly examined to determine the extent to which it is flexible and to which it provides incentives for departmental savings. Faculty fellowships should be provided for concentration on specific projects; this saves money for the institution in that the project is usually completed in a shorter period of time and is better planned than if developed on a catch-as-catch-can basis. Noted faculty members should be shared between institutions with the home institution paying the salary--this provides new faces and new ideas at  a time when faculty are not turning over, and occasionally gives the teacher the feeling that the home institution is not so bad after all. Institutions should increasingly share facilities and responsibilities. Classified staff should be motivated through financial rewards and better recognition of their expertise to devise money-saving ideas. Equipment and space sharing possibilities should be examined. Students should be given credit for voluntary work experience on the campus and should be tapped as a source of potential ideas. (DC)",

        "description":"The reading lab at Ohlone College has developed a comprehensive and unique program which is designed to help students on all levels of ability to become more independent in the learning process. This program or system consists of several interrelated components: eight individualized reading and study skills courses, 81 videotapes, and a 60 page &quot;Tutor's Handbook.&quot; Students may elect to enroll in any of the eight individualized skill building courses for a letter grade or on a credit/no credit basis. Materials used in these courses are commercially available, self-paced, and multilevel. Materials are available in an open lab situation; each student must attend the lab for three hours each week--one hour for a pretest, one hour for explanation of test results and a list of  recommended study materials, and one hour for a posttest. The 81 videotapes can be divided into five categories: (1) orientation to each of the eight courses; (2) how to use laboratory machines; (3) how to use texts; (4) 15 study skills lessons; and (5) tutor training presentations. These allow the lab instructor and the instructional assistant to devote more time to each student. The &quot;Tutor's Handbook&quot; is available to tutors who help students with particular difficulties. (DC)",

Under the present system faculty must be evaluated every two years, but, within certain guidelines, departmental procedures may vary. A total of 77.3 percent of all faculty and administrators responded. Analysis of the data revealed the following: (1) the purpose of evaluation for regular (tenured) staff should be for the improvement of instruction; for contract (nontenured) staff the question of retention or dismissal should also be considered (present procedures treat regular and contract staff equally); (2) most faculty find evaluation moderately effective and beneficial and not threatening; (3) many faculty  members seem to spend more time and receive more benefits from participating in the evaluation of others than themselves; (4) most faculty feel that the department chairman should be actively involved in evaluation; (5) a large number of faculty did not receive copies of their evaluations, although they should have; (6) over 85 percent of the respondents did not think that Bakersfield College should &quot;try to do a complete and effective evaluation job, substantially exceeding legal requirements&quot;; and (7) over 80 percent want to continue the present plan with minor modifications. The questionnaire, cover letters, tabulated responses, and additional faculty comments are presented. (DC)",

Only 43 (20 percent) of the 215 questionnaires sent out were returned; however, these respondents represented about half of the large garages and auto dealers so that 35-40 percent of the total full-time employment may have been represented. Most respondents were unaware of the auto program at BC and were suspicious that college auto programs were unrealistic in terms of skills really needed in the shop. However, there was an indication that they would hire BC graduates quite readily if they could be convinced that  graduates were willing to work hard and had practical experience. For this, publicity is needed. Employers indicated great difficulty in hiring well-trained auto mechanics in almost any specialty--this indicates a need for more auto mechanics students at BC. Short-term updating courses, particularly in the area of electronic ignition, would be the kind of course to which employers would be most apt to send employees. Because employees want students trained in conditions similar to those encountered on the job, BC should obtain funds for the construction of a new auto shop building as soon as possible. (DC)",

        "author":["Belzer, Thomas J."],
        "description":"This study correlates the relationship between varying methods in student evaluation and its effect on student achievement and attrition. The sample studied consisted of 230 students enrolled in three separate semesters of General Biology 11A at Pasadena City College in 1972, 1973, and 1974. The earlier students were given longer exams over three or four weeks of material. The 1974 class was given frequent quizzes over smaller amounts of material. All three courses were taught by the same instructor. Results indicate that A and B grades constituted 40 percent of all grades given in the 1972 and 1973 semesters; C and D grades constituted the remaining 60 percent. These proportions were reversed for the 1974 semester, in which A and B grades represented 60 percent and C and D  grades represented 40 percent. Furthermore, attrition percentage dropped from an average of 26 percent in the 1972 and 1973 semesters to approximately 12 percent during the spring 1974 semester. From these findings it seems that one of the crucial factors influencing final grades and attrition is the method used in student evaluation. Results are graphed and are compared using chi-square as a test of significance. A brief review of the literature relating to grading and evaluation systems is presented along with a 27 item bibliography. (DC)",

        "description":"Associate degree nursing programs were first established in 1953. At the same time, diploma programs and baccalaureate programs were preparing nurses with the potential for licensure as registered nurses. Recently, there has been a decline in diploma programs and an increase in associate degree programs. Associate degree programs emphasize action in specific situations rather than theoretical explanations. A review of the literature pertaining to associate degree nursing programs reveals a large gap between what students of such programs are taught and the duties they are expected to perform on the job; this results in long adjustment periods during which the employer must provide continuous supervision. The primary cause of this situation is that the term \"beginning  practitioner\" is interpreted differently by educators, employers, and new graduates. In order to solve this problem, training institutions and employers must establish better avenues of communication and educators must alter their curricula to meet employer needs. Furthermore, educators must realize that preparing any individual for specific duties may lead to skill obsolescence and should develop continuing education programs to encourage life-long professional development.

In an effort to contribute to the administrative reorganization proposed for 1975-76, the author reviewed recent literature concerning administrative organization and examined the organizational charts of 50 community colleges (37 in Illinois and 13 in Pennsylvania) to determine the most common pattern of relationships between chief student personnel officers and other chief administrators. In at least 75 percent of the 50 institutions studied, the dean of student  services reports directly to the president of the college. In only one institution is the dean of student services placed on the same level as academic division chairmen. The author recommends equal status for the deans of student services, academic affairs, and administration/business and advocates the elimination of vice-presidents placed between the president and these three deans.

        "description":"This study attempted to assess use of the campus &quot;free hour&quot; (Tuesday, 12-1) inaugurated in the fall 1974 semester. During the &quot;free hour,&quot; classes were not scheduled so that various campus clubs, committees, and special presentations could be scheduled without conflicting with classes. A brief questionnaire was sent to members of the day faculty; 145 faculty members, about 40 percent of the total, responded. Thirty-eight (26 percent) of the respondents indicated that they had participated in some way during the semester. The most common activities listed were meetings--departmental, committee, staff, and administrative. Fifteen faculty members indicated that they had sponsored club or other student activities. A question asking whether or not the respondent favored discontinuing  the free hour evoked some strong statements on both sides of the question. &quot;Yes&quot; responses outnumbered &quot;No&quot; responses by more than two to one. The major objection to the free hour was clearly the scheduling of classes beginning at 7:45 a.m. with resulting student tardiness, loss of instruction time, and lowered enrollments. Of those supporting the free hour, many felt that it had not been given an adequate test, that the time of day was not the best, and that it was not given enough publicity. It was recommended that the &quot;free hour&quot; be re-evaluated at the close of fall 1975. (Author/AH)",

It is hoped that the campus architecture will blend into the community and that the campus will be considered as a cultural and educational center for local community residents of all ages. Within a &quot;shopping center&quot; format, all offerings will be openly displayed, clearly labeled, priced, and described. Modular scheduling, performance objectives, and core curricula will characterize the  student-centered learning process. The campus will undertake periodic educational audits to keep programs abreast of changes in technology, knowledge, and community needs. Facilities will include an Educational Clinic for diagnosis of individual student needs and a Learning Resources Support Center. Satellite units, TV courses, and mobile learning units will also be a part of Rock Creek's educational services. (DC)",

Four behavior categories were identified: verbalizing, visual regard, onlooking, and mutual play.

The current focus in psychology on the individual, frequently without adequate analysis of the social context, has led to research, training, and service programs that are concerned with development of the individual, diagnosis of the individual, and individual treatment. More training in a socioecological developmental psychology will produce scientists and practitioners who are knowledgeable about the role of family and community in child development. This training will lead to better diagnosis and evaluation of family and  community factors and of professional and institutional policies and practices that influence child care and child development. More socioecological training of professionals would also lead to consideration of ecological variables in program planning and evaluation and to professional and institutional consultation, support, and training for parents.

The research strategy aims at evaluating the subject's performances on problem solving tasks by having subjects become active agents in the discovery process while experimenters remain as passive and neutral as possible. The subject is asked to solve a problem by asking questions to get the information he or she needs to reach a solution. The subject becomes an active searcher; the experimenter only provides the information requested. The subject's tactics indicate how he or she deals with the structure of the problem. Thinking about a problem becomes a way of making explicit and communicable to oneself or to others its logical structure. If this is so,  it is of interest to know how subjects belonging to different cultural settings process problems, and the influence that their structure and the symbolic system used (manner of presentation) have on tactics. The subject's performance can then by analyzed in terms of the set of logical rules that he or she uses and of the symbolic systems that favor or hamper problem solving performance. (CS)",

It was hypothesized that some pupils might be happier in a traditional, or structured, environment. Five variables were hypothesized to interact singly and in combination with degree of openness: grade level, sex, intellectence, origence, and academic locus of control. Three studies were conducted. In the first study, four attitude instruments were administered to 1,000 open and 1,000 traditional pupils in grades 1-8. In the second study, Welsh's measures in intellectence and origence were administered to pupils from the previous sample in grades 4  and 6. In the third study, Crandall's measures of academic locus of control was administered to pupils in grades 4, 6, and 8 from the previous sample. Pupils in the open classrooms did not exhibit the expected more positive response toward teachers, did not perceive more freedom in the learning process, and exhibited lower attitudes toward mathematics and language arts. Results appear to indicate, however, that age is a significant interacting variable, and that more attention might be given at the upper grades to providing an open learning situation. (CS)",

(2) Does behavior modification in the primary setting have any systematic effect on children's behavior in the other (secondary) setting? Thirty-five children, identified by either parents or teachers as having behavior problems either at home or at school, were involved in an intervention treatment study: (1) 15 children were referred for outpatient treatment for 'active' behavior problems in the home setting (the 'home problem' sample); (2) 12 children, the 'school problem' sample, were referred for treatment of behavior problems in the school setting; and (3) 8 children were  recruited to form the 'school problem control' sample. Verbal reports by parents and teachers were obtained, and independent measures were taken in both the home and school setting on the 'deviant' children. The Walker Problem Identification Checklist was administered to the children's teachers, and the Bi-Polar Adjective Checklist was given to all parents of children before and after receiving their respective treatments. Study results indicate that unprogrammed positive generalization rarely occurs. If children have difficulty in both school and home settings they should probably receive simultaneous treatment in both settings. (CS)",

The second study considered the effects of men and women teacher teams on day care children's performance on tests of cognitive skill, cognitive style, and conservation of gender identity. Measurement involved the use of subtests from conventional intelligence tests, the Boy-Girl Identity Task, and tests of impulsivity-reflectivity. The third study sought to evaluate sex-typed classification of school objects by children in classes with teachers  differing in sex. The study attempted to ascertain whether sex-typed attitudes were present at entry into the classroom and whether a year's exposure to men or women teachers affected their classification. Subjects for all three studies were 59 4-year-old preschool children attending a day care center in a working class community and nine teachers (five females and four males).

Of the 96 subjects, 46 (23 pairs) were identical twins; 22 subjects (11 pairs) were same-sexed fraternal; and 28 (14 pairs) opposite-sexed fraternal twins. The twins were tested in their homes, generally, within two weeks of their 18-month birthday. For the entire group, the overall Mental Development Index was 95.5; for identical twins, the average Index was 94.0; for same-sexed fraternal twins, the average Index was 90.4; and for opposite-sexed twins, the average  Index was 102.2. These results are discussed, and it is suggested that the typical differential treatment given to boys and girls may lead to a greater differentiation of treatment and/or more individual attention for the opposite-sexed twins than for same-sexed twins. In addition, twin-pair interaction may differ for same-sexed and opposite-sexed twins, influencing each twin's intellectual development in different ways. (CS)",

Four topic areas are identified as the foundation of educational capacity: language development, curiosity, social development, and cognitive intelligence. Professional educators, working directly with children, especially children over 6 years of age, have much less influence than was previously thought. From this perspective, the family must receive increasing priority as the first educational delivery system. Three main obstacles, however, confront families attempting to do the best job of educating their young children: ignorance, stress, and the lack of assistance. For the first six years of the child's life, especially the  first three, continuing, low pressure, strictly voluntary, training for parents should be made available. Training could be made available in hospitals during the lying-in period, through adult education courses, and through public television programs. (CS)",

The research also attempted to replicate the results of Golinkoff's experiments which probed for cognitive categories in infants having relevance for linguistic development. Twelve male and 12 female infants, 17-19 months of age, were randomly assigned to one of three transformation groups involving anomaly with a direction change, anomaly with a position change, or a nonanomalous transformation that involved a position and direction change. Heart  rate and visual fixations were recorded as each subject was presented with the standard event, repeated six times, followed by one of the three transformation events, repeated six times. Findings indicated that heart rate can be measured in 18-month-olds watching filmed events and that heart rate seems to sensitively assess attentional changes. (SDH)",

Information on parents' views of day care services was gathered from questionnaires given to 99 parents who were receiving federal child care support and using in-home day care. The questionnaire explored before-school schedules, working patterns of the mothers, after-school supervision patterns, and parents' priorities for school-age day care program elements. The section on program planning examined these areas: potential school-age population to be served,  facility types, program activities and components, state and federal requirements, funding resources, and staffing requirements. The final part of the book contains five different program models of school-age day care which are based on: recreation and leisure time programs; community school-based services; family day care services; the coordination of family day care homes and neighborhood parks for full day summer day care; and a residential cluster model with \"cultural enrichment\" components.

The project had three aims: to determine the general needs of families, to find which services were known and utilized, and to identify services adequately meeting needs. Four minority populations were included in the study: Mexican Americans, Migrant, American Indian, and Black. A personal interview was conducted with each subject family utilizing a structured questionnaire. In assessing the need of minority families, six areas were considered: social environment (i.e. housing, income), educational attainment, language skills, health care, child care and nutrition. Analysis of the data revealed that: (1) general socioeconomic conditions of  the minorities were below the general population of the state; (2) child care arrangements were generally made by utilizing an immediate family member or friend; (3) immunization data was difficult to assess; and (4) low consumption of fruits and vegetables by each group. The areas which warrant improvements include: migrant and Indian housing, family health care and immunization, child care facilities, nutrition information and a public assistance program which more adequately meets each family's needs.

In the first study, data collected through questionnaires were analyzed using personal and demographic characteristics of respondents as independent variables. Findings indicate that parents place higher priority on items in the intellectual dimension than did educators, who were more inclined toward items in the personal dimension. Parents, teachers, and principals were in relative agreement on the priority of the items in the social dimension. In the second study (in  which 301 first-grade teachers responded to a questionnaire), economic conditions were judged to have a major effect upon the learning needs of entering first-graders. A list of 38 rank-ordered pupil needs is presented as representing those learning objectives which should be met prior to first grade entry. Statistical findings, analysis of the data, and recommendations for further research are described. (CS)",

In terms of instructional approach, the program closely followed Piagetian theory and included preservice and inservice teacher training. The program was evaluated in terms of 26 product and 26 process objectives, covering the affective, cognitive and psychomotor domains. The procedures for process evaluation employed the locally developed Classroom Activity Checklist as the primary instrument. Four locally constructed instruments were used in the product evaluation. In addition, parent participation records were kept by the classroom teachers. Process data indicated that the  program was implemented as planned, and product data showed that the pupils mastered 25 of the 26 product objectives.

        "description":"This study attempts to reinforce developmental theory concerning spatial Comprehension by building on the qualitative observations of art educators of the past, and by strengthening the empirical basis of contemporary investigations into the relationship between pictorial representations, intellectual maturity, and environmental stimulation. Drawings from a wide variety of cultures were studied to determine whether the sequence and rate at which developmental characteristics appear are similar, or reflect unequal socioeconomic/educational opportunities and ethnic diversity within societies. Also investigated was whether differences between societies may correlate with modernity, prevalence of literacy, and severity of social stratification. A total of 9,000 drawings was collected  from middle and lower class children in grades 1, 3, 5, and 7 in nine countries. Each child was asked to draw a picture of himself at play with friends near his home or school. Sorting categories were based on Piaget's description of stages in the development of the concept of space and the growth of logical thought. Results suggest that these drawing stages follow an invariant sequence. Mean ages, higher than expected, lie within a large range at each stage; the mode appears at the onset of concrete operations; and differences, when appearing, generally lie in the direction of higher scores for advantaged groups.

The concepts describing the changes that occur during this developmental period, such as exploratory behavior, cognitive behavior, and moral behavior are invariably cast in nonobservable terms indigenous to the psychoanalytic, social learning, and cognitive approaches. To make them consistent with the objectives, assumptions, and principles of a functional analysis of behavior, these concepts must be reanalyzed and redefined.

Lewin postulated that a state of tension within a person motivates movement toward the accomplishment of desired goals; a goal structure specifies the type of interdependence existing among persons as they work towards goal accomplishment. Discussion focuses on the conditions under which each goal structure may be productively used in instruction, the research relating to the overuse and inappropriate use of competition, and the research on the effects of cooperative goal structure on the coutcomes of instruction. Briefly summarized are the findings of the research now available in social psychology and  education on the effects of goal structures on education. The results of the research overwhelmingly point to the need to train teachers in the procedures for all goal structures appropriately. (CS)",

Additional investigative procedures involved regular meetings with the parents which afforded the opportunity to obtain data on television viewing habits and on personal attitudes toward sex role in child rearing and toward  the personal and social self-worth of the parents. A second phase of the investigation involved observing the children during the Misterogers programs to see what kinds of materials held their attention. Finally, intervention procedures included the establishment of parent groups that met through the following year to provide help in learning to use the television medium more effectively. Findings for each phase of the project are discussed, and implications of the study are presented. (SDH)",

A series of activities help the student to develop flexible ways of thinking about children. Three 'modules' are identified in this curriculum sequence, and appropriate readings are suggested for each level of  the program. The study of child development is combined with work with young children on a regular basis.

The focus of the 230 hours of behavioral observations has been aggressive and submissive behavior in the peer groups. Dyadic aggressive-submissive interactions are recorded, and their outcomes are entered into a matrix which then provides the basic index of dominance relations between the children. In addition to making  observations of the children, the project staff participate in meetings, seminars, and feedback sessions with the school staff which provide opportunities for formal and informal information exchange.

The curriculum for each grade level, described briefly, indicates four main areas: mathematics, classification, perceptual-motor skills, and reading. The PEP testing program, designed to assess and monitor student learning progress, includes a placement and diagnostic pre- and posttest battery. Data concerning student learning outcomes are presented. In addition,  comparisons are made among various PEP groups and between PEP and non-PEP classes. Also examined are the relationship between achievement and some possible predictors of learning success and the relationship between performance on the PEP curricula and on standardized tests.

Curriculum objectives concerned with the development of general cognitive and socio-emotional skills are given. Teacher and student functions are described.

The introduction, in which the rationale and purpose of the program are discussed, is followed by the service manual which contains a model of the process of screening and service developed through the E.I.D.P. The practical information needed to implement an early identification program may be found in the manual. The two-part research section is composed of reports of studies involving various groups of schools. The Forest Hill report  provides a description of the screening process which preceded the main E.I.D.P. The central portion of the research report is a description of the predictive tests and interviews used in selecting high risk children and includes a discussion of the major screening packages in terms of reliability and validity. The bibliography contains a list of tests as well as reference sources. Appendixes include instructions for administering and scoring screening tests and samples of interview forms and letters.

Major program objectives were the development of greater academic growth and more positive self-concept for residents (as measured via pre- and post-testing) and development of a pilot program for students required to live and learn in a resident center. The program (October 1973 to August 1974) was carried out via a 3 phase operation which involved teacher training and study of site utilization, culminating in a 7 week modular summer program and involving all (approximately 90) students in several disciplines. One week summer classes included  English, history, science, art, horsemanship, camping, advanced math, advanced communication and library skills, music, shop, photography, remedial reading and math, advanced shop, and advanced photography. All classes had outdoor oriented activities such as studying the Hudson River, building a log cabin, visiting a self-sufficient community, trail riding, simulating auto purchases, etc. Student and teacher evaluations of student adjustment were generally favorable, as were evaluations of academic achievement. Future outdoor education programs were also favored. (JC)",

The study's major objective was to describe the history of, and conceptually account for, the development of this new ethnic power struggle in which the control of schools played a primary role. Both towns, situated in a region known for its year-round vegetable economy, shared such demographic characteristics as population size, ethnic composition, and Anglo dominance of the economy. Among the 146 persons interviewed were past and present school board members, persons who had unsuccessfully competed for school board positions, administrators, teachers, city and county officials, and Raza Unida Party members. Observations of such events as school board meetings,  city council meetings, football games and practices, church services, and confrontations between the Better Government League, local Ciudadanos, Crystal City Anglos, and the Crystal City Raza Unida Party were conducted. Some findings were: (1) historically Anglos had dominated the Mexican American socially and culturally by controlling the agricultural economy; (2) both ethnic sectors perceived schools as a basic local energy source to be used as power in controlling the local physical and social environment; and (3) ethnic conflict resulted in a decrease of &quot;latitude&quot; for subordinates' actions within the school domain.

Undertaken by WSSP, SPURS attacks the lack of specialized education services and general lag in implementing improved educational practices in rural areas. A long-range goal of SPURS is to provide the students with a total curriculum based upon the Life-Involvement Model (LIM). Since LIM develops competence by direct engagement with the real world, the subject matter is taken from the environment in which the child lives. Students are taught to: (1) proceed under their own direction, exploring unfamiliar areas of their environment; and (2) practice making and executing decisions, putting them into effect  and experiencing the consequences of their actions, and modifying their behavior in response to the feedback. LIM involves 3 general types of instruments: (1) Carrier Projects, (2) Units, and (3) Ventures. This booklet is primarily an outline to accompany a workshop conducted by experienced LIM personnel. Based upon project experiences during the 1971-72 school year, this guidebook includes: (1) a rationale for the LIM; (2) a description of the instrumental products and guidelines for producing them; and (3) sample record keeping systems.

Some findings were: (1) considerable amount of Public Assistance was being received by the citizens; (2) programs were needed to meet the needs of old citizens in the Area on a more adequate basis; (3) there was a shift from agriculture, railroads, and mining to manufacturing, utilities, service industries, medical, and professional employment; and (4) little, if any, long range planning for the future was being done by individuals or agencies in the Area.

Topics discussed are: (1) the first day of school for a Chicano; (2) what students feel; (3) what teachers expect of Chicanos; (4) what schools are doing; and (5) bilingual/bicultural education. The report of the Mexican American Study are listed. (NQ)",

Via personal interview, respondents were asked questions relative to 6 areas: educational opportunities; county government and law enforcement; environmental conditions; availability of community services; income; and general quality of life for selected subgroups. The sample county, predominantly rural nonfarm, was  almost 50 percent black; median education level was 9.0; and median family income was $5,973. Of the 25 community leaders, randomly chosen, 18 completed the interview. The randomly selected household sample afforded 72 completed questionnaires. Black respondents constituted a subsample of the total household group with 31 responses. Results revealed that community leaders tended to rate the current situation more favorably than the other two groups; all groups reported progress but the black group noted a slight decline in income, though they responded favorably to educational opportunities.

Data were collected via random sample surveys (personal interviews with head of household or their substitutes) in 3 rural black parishes of Louisiana. The 594 respondents were asked to respond to the following Srole items: In spite of what people say, the lot of the average man is getting worse; It's hardly fair to bring children into the world with the way things look for the future; Nowadays a person has to live pretty much for today and let tomorrow take care of itself;  These days a person doesn't really know who can count on; There's little use writing to public officials because often they aren't interested in the problems of the average man. Nearly two thirds of the respondents were classified in the high anomia scale category and significant inverse relationships were found in feelings of anomia as related to education, income, voter registration, and number of organizational affilations (pessimism was lower among those who participated in secondary associations and/or the political process).

        "description":"Changes in marital and procreative projections among rural Louisiana high school youth between 1968 and 1972 were examined. In 1968 a proportionate, stratified, random cluster sampling technique was employed to secure data on seniors from 13 white and 7 black high schools. In 1972 public school integration and the establishment of private schools prevented historical comparison of the same schools, but insofar as was possible an attempt was made to involve the specific respondents who would have been 1972 seniors in the 20 schools from 1968, corresponding to the racial grouping of the 1968 sample. In both instances an 18 page version of the 1968 S-61 Southern Youth Study questionnaire was group administered with the exception of one school in the 1972 sample (544 questionnaires  were completed in 1968 and 453 in 1972). Data measuring change were analyzed by sex, race, and residence relative to the following items: (1) Desired Age at Marriage; (2) Number of Children Desired; (3) Number of Children Expected; (4) Desire for Wife Working After Marriage; (5) Expectation for Wife Working After Marriage; and (6) Importance of Family and Marriage. Tabular data constitutes the major portion of this paper, while a brief narrative describes the research procedure. (JC)",

The extent of social participation was determined by assigning a numerical score to every social interaction beyond the nuclear family and each membership in a formal organization, from which an overall score was derived for each household head. Race was used as a control factor throughout the analysis. Srole's scale of anomie was utilized to determine the degree of social withdrawal among household heads. Results indicated impoverished  household heads who had different levels of social participation did not differ significantly in the demographic, social, or economic factors nor in respect to participation levels, degree of anomie, or willingness to leave the community. But the children of impoverished parents who were participation inclined had significantly more formal education and moved significantly greater distances from their home of origin. (JC)",

        "description":"Gallup Polls conducted between 1966 and 1972 indicated that the percentage of persons stating they would prefer living in a city has steadily declined, reaching the all-time low of 13 percent in 1972. Interviews conducted with a sample of 1,806 Americans showed that while one-third of the respondents currently live in towns, villages, or rural areas, almost 60 percent would prefer to. Data collected in various state surveys are generally supportive of the national polling data. A statewide sample of over 3,000 Washington State residents indicated some degree of preference for life in areas characterized by smaller populations and more open country. When combined with a series of other factors, this preference may contribute to significant pressures for migration to areas that  provide easy access to rural amenities. This paper discusses the hypothesis that such factors as reduced social overhead costs of space, the fact that outdoor amenity goods are superior goods, the increased independence of income from location, and the increased costs in high density areas will combine with the residential preferences that are already evident to create increased pressures for migration toward rural areas.

A questionnaire, which replicated other data sets to facilitate comparability, was designed to tap (1) ethnic identification with 4 elements considered to be integral characteristics of the \"mejicano\" culture--language, contact with Mexico, cuisine, and folk medicine; and (2) the respondents' attitudes toward ethnic separation. Some findings were: (1) overall, a strong sense of ethnic identification continued to govern the life styles of\"mejicanos\" in San Antonio; (2) the language, way of life, traditions, and social interaction favored the persistence of the ethnic factor; (3) there was no discernable ideological preference in the affect or attachment choices, nor did there seem to be much support for Spanish surnamed leaders on the basis of their ethnicity; and (4) the range of awareness of political leaders was rather narrow.

Programs 3-6 define four known school management options--(1) the Federal School; (2) the Public  School; (3) the Tribal-Private or Contract School (legally authorized by written contract between the BIA and a tribally authorized group); and (4) the Combination School (a combination of the legal and financial aspects of Public, Federal, and Tribal-Private Schools). A fifth option is described as any new school program that has not yet been tried.

        "description":"An intense preoccupation with death is evident in the Mexican culture's pre-Columbian art, myths, and religion. This preoccupation is still present in the urban Mexican American. A death in a Mexican family causes a set of emotions and events quite different from those seen in an Anglo family. The Mexican reaction to death is such that if the full process of mourning is not completed, it is possible that the survivors may find it so difficult to return to their \"normal\" life that they cease to function. Death and lack of resolution through mourning and grief are among the many events which may lead to a \"nervous breakdown\". The Xipe-Totec Clinica de Salud Mental, which has been in operation since November 1971 at Metropolitan State Hospital in Norwalk, California, uses these  feelings to develop a ritual-drama to facilitate catharsis in Spanish-speaking mental patients. The patient is placed in a familiar cultural setting where the decorations and furnishings, language, music, social activities, and customs are such as to relax him and remove additional stress caused by conflict with the Anglo culture. The goal is to bring about a collective response in the group. Strong expression of emotion is the most important element in the \"funeral ceremonies\". Collective mourning for the dead is essential if the technique is to work therapeutically for the patient. (Author/NQ)",

        "description":"Texas, like the rest of the nation, is undergoing a shift toward an excess of females. Review of the changing balance of the sexes reveals that there were only 95.9 males per 100 females in 1970 with a projected drop to 93.8 by 1980. In 1950 Texas had an excess of 15,000 males, but by 1960 females outnumbered males by 90,000 and by 234,000 in 1970. Females outlive males (those born in 1974 can expect to outlive males by almost 8 years), and even though historically more males are born than females, the mortality rate for males is higher at every age level; therefore, the number of females begins to increase proportionately with each advancement of age. In Texas there are more males in rural than in urban areas (in 1970, 100.1 per 100 females), but that ratio is declining due  partially to the influence of rural to urban migration. Texas has more males per 100 females among whites than among nonwhites, their sex ratios being 96.3 and 93.1 respectively in 1970. Generally, the balance between the sexes determines to an important extent future patterns of fertility, mortality, and migration. Specifically it influences the institution of marriage (older women may be marrying younger men), control of wealth (widowed females will inherit male controlled wealth), and politics (a larger female constituency may serve female interests).

Students have not improved their knowledge, comprehension, and application in language arts by an 0.75 grade level equivalent, but have accomplished these goals in mathematics.

Derived from a project evaluation submitted August 19, 1974, this informal report presents comparative data on the open concept and traditional school. Using a &quot;frequency observed&quot; parameter, evaluators compared the experimental school with a traditional school from the same district via site observations. Transition from elementary to junior high school was evaluated via data relative to daily absenteeisms, discipline referrals, and academic failure in math, English, social studies, and sciences for grades 7 and 8. Parental attitudes were evaluated via 30 completed questionnaires (over 100 were solicited).  Student attitudes were measured by a 25 item questionnaire wherein response was made via a picture of a &quot;smiling&quot;, neutral, or negative face. Teacher attitudes were measured by a written questionnaire concerned with implementation procedures (lesson plans, classroom rules, discipline, work assignments, etc.) The evaluator's summation stated that &quot;In general, the open concept program has exhibited success in meeting its objectives; its major weakness involves the language arts and reading components of the program, as well as staff communication&quot;.

Project goals are defined as the acquisition through research, experiment, and planning of information relative to sparsely populated areas and special problems of distance, small population base, industry, and special sociocultural features. This three stage project involves: (1) an interview inquiry (parent expectations and child needs) and a general design based on inquiry results (1972); (2) preparation of experimental teaching plans (spring 1973 for fall 1973 and fall 1973 for 1974) and inquiry into the environmental stimulation of the preschool aged in sparsely populated areas (1973); (3) initiation of the experiment using  different forms of solution in several communes in North Karelia (1973-74) and multiple problem study in the latter half of 1973. Both internal and external evaluations are being employed. During stages of implementation (1974-75), the intention is to map obstacles and developments and plan accordingly; adjust teacher training; examine suitability of teaching materials and the institutes of daycare as stimulus environments; and conduct research relative to rural problems. Information derived from the project study will be used to aid in development of a consistent curriculum for rural preschool children. (JC)",

The project's two major thrusts were: (1) project management and consortium arrangements and (2) articulation of curriculum objectives, content, and activities. Faculty members and administrators from 17 2-year and 4-year &quot;developing&quot; institutions of higher education located in the Southwestern United States participated. The research training program consisted of: (1) an entry skills diagnostic test administered prior to the start of formal instruction; (2) a formal academic training phase; and  (3) a practicum or followup phase conducted at the parent institution and at the Educational Testing Service. Both &quot;enroute&quot; and terminal performance measures were used in the program's evaluation. Although the model was deficient along some lines, it proved to be useful in identifying the major dimensions of a training program. This report contains documentation of the program objectives, activities, and evaluation and the results of testing a transportable training model.

Respondents were 550 Lubbock Anglo households randomly selected from the local city directory. Respondents represented a cross-section of Anglo Lubbockites, averaging 36 years old, with more than 1 year of college, head of a family of 3.8 persons, and receiving an annual income of $11,250. Questionnaires were distributed by students to the respondents who were asked to read over the questionnaire while the student waited so as to be available to explain anything which the respondent felt needed clarification. Some findings were: (1) Anglos perceived Mexican Americans as individuals rather than  as a monolithic stereotyped mass; (2) Anglos said they would not reject a Mexican American at the polls if he were otherwise qualified and the office he sought was a local one even though no Mexican American candidate had yet been successful; (3) 52.9 percent of the respondents considered relations between themselves and Mexican Americans were only &quot;average&quot; while 17.1 percent felt they were &quot;poor&quot;; and (4) 65.2 percent preferred that Mexican Americans join Anglo organizations rather than form their own.

        "description":"To determine the short term effects of a large apparel plant on the economy of a relatively isolated, highly rural Ozark area (8 counties), characterized by low income and few employment opportunities, this study compared 1959 data on the study area and the state of Arkansas with similar post plant data (1960-1963). Data were compared on income distribution, major income sources, agriculture, labor force characteristics, educational distribution, public facilities, employment (manufacturing, nonmanufacturing, and covered), jobs generated by shirt plant, estimated income increase, and paid unemployment benefits. Approximately a 13 percent increase in total personal income was attributed to the shirt plant which began operations in the fall of 1960 at Gassville in Baxter County.  Total annual employment at the plant was estimated to have become stabilized at about 1,170 persons (750 jobs in the plant itself with an estimated $2.2 million payroll, 85 indirect jobs in the study area, and 335 jobs elsewhere, most employees being women), but due to a slowdown of male out migration and the addition of previously unemployed females to the unemployed roles, unemployment was not significantly reduced. Though public schools were little affected, improved medical facilities, a public water system, an airport, and a fire department were among the public facilities resulting from plant development.

A proportionate, stratified random cluster sampling technique was employed for sample selection. A total of 20 schools (13 white and 7 black) constituted sample selection for 1968. In 1972 public school integration and establishment of private academies confounded opportunity to study historical change in the same schools, but a racial grouping corresponding to the 1968 study was utilized, and an attempt was made to involve the specific respondents who would have been 1972 seniors in the 20 schools from 1968. In both studies an 18 page version of the 1968 S-61 Southern Youth Study questionnaire was group administered to 544 (1968) and 453 (1972) seniors,  though the 1972 questionnaire included the Occupational Aspiration Scale and significant-other influence items and 17 additional mailed responses. Change was measured in terms of (1) residence aspirations; (2) residence expectations; (3) anticipatory deflection; (4) intensity of aspiration; and (5) certainty of expectations, as identified by race, sex, and place of residence. Findings reported via tabular data constituted the major portion of this comparative study. (JC)",

They are characterized by great intra-group diversity along generational, locational, socioeconomic, and acculturational lines. There is also evidence of increasing differentiation in social relations with non-Chicanos, in family patterns, and in the maintenance of cultural distinctiveness. Yet, Chicanos share, to varying degrees, some common elements of history, culture, &quot;blood&quot;, and position relative to the American core culture. The political experiences of a Mexican American youngster are different from those of his core culture counterpart. His political world is more &quot;locally circumscribed&quot; than that of core culture children. The Chicano's  political development is influenced by 3 complex and interrelated phenomena: (1) his cultural values; (2) his contacts with the dominant core culture; and (3) his societal position which results from both his cultural values and his contacts with the dominant core culture. His political development is also influenced by colonialism, his physical distinctiveness, his language, the school, the local community (barrio), authority relations, and his family. (Author/NQ)",

Yet despite several centuries of systematic Americanization, there remains a definite cultural mosaic in the United States. In the post-Melting Pot Era, such terms as Chicano, Mexican American, Spanish, Latino, Hispano, and Spanish American have been used interchangeably to refer to a person of Spanish, Mexican, and Indian descent. This ambiguity in usage exists because social realities, the complexities of intra-group dynamics, and different sub-group life styles have been disregarded. There is further confusion and misuse because of the preferred label usage self-imposed by the people themselves in different  geographical areas. Ideological differences, social class status, socioeconomic status, age, and politico-social consciousness are overriding factors. All &quot;raza&quot; types participate in varying degrees and intensity in &quot;El Movimiento&quot;. This paper sorts out some of the &quot;raza&quot; types, shows &quot;raza&quot; group interaction and thereby differentiates between the sub-groups, and discusses &quot;El Movimiento&quot; activities (usually dismissed as militancy) by other &quot;raza&quot; than Chicanos.

This conference report is intended to serve as a useful source of ideas; as background information on international rural educational thinking; as encouragement to others to associate themselves with this conference; and particularly this year, in the context of Scottish education, as a guide to the future for all concerned with problems in the enlarged perspective of the new Scottish Regions, especially administrative and professional staff in the Educational Offices and those in the Regional Education Committees. Designed to be of maximum relevance to the 1974 Scottish  situation, conference themes are, nonetheless, applicable to rural areas in general. Themes include: (1) the educational implications of regionalization; (2) problems facing rural schools (primary, secondary, and administrative); (3) education and rural depopulation; and (4) problems of language and culture (special reference to Gaelic and bilingual education). Questions derived from these themes are presented in conjunction with individual working committee resolutions and/or recommendations (some 60 conference participants representing Norway, Scotland, Ireland, Sweden, and Wales).

The measures of educational effort used were then evaluated to determine whether they might be usefully applied to other areas and communities. Data on population, school enrollment, wealth, and educational expenditures were collected for the period 1961 to 1968. Four sets of educational effort indexes were calculated--total operating expenditures and assessment; total net operating expenditures and personal income; net operating expenditures per pupil and personal income per capita; and municipal share of total operating expenditures and  personal income. The income elasticity of demand for education was also calculated. Some findings were: (1) total educational expenditures for the communities of Flin Flon, Pinawa, Lynn Lake, and Red Lake, related to the local wealth indicators used, compared favorably with equivalent figures for Manitoba; (2) educational effort indexes for Thompson were generally equivalent to, or somewhat below, the figures for the other communities and Manitoba; and (3) when using the municipal shares of local educational expenditures, the communities' educational effort was reasonably equivalent to Manitoba's for most of the years examined.

The study's objective was to develop a viable framework for determining the role of education in the area's economic development. Data, obtained from the Department of Education and the 13 high schools in the Interlake Area, were analyzed by multiple regression analysis, an input-output table, and present value equations. Among the findings were: (1)  the schools provided employment for a large number of teachers and support staff who spent money in the community and supported local businesses; (2) construction of schools provided jobs in the community and supported the level of local business sales; (3) the higher the town average income, the lower the dropout rate; (4) human capital value increased when the dropout rate was lowered; and (5) towns with low average income levels had teachers with low salaries and low qualifications which led to low quality of education.

This guide is divided into three sections which deal with the evaluation questions. The first section considers the goals of environmental education. The three phases of the environmental education process (discovery and inquiry; evaluation and problem identification; and problem solving) are considered. The relationship between  what a person knows and feels in relation to his value system, and how environmental education can affect and change this relationship is discussed to answer question 2. Section three deals with the third question; behavioral objectives as tools for evaluating skills in discovery and inquiry, evaluation and problem identification, and problem solving are examined. Sample test items are included. The appendices include evaluation considerations, a unit outline example, and the results of an evaluation. (TK)",

It is recommended that any new science programs adopted must include the equipment and materials that are an integral part of the program as well as in-service training. Consultants are  recommended who would focus on desirable teaching behavior and make resources available.

This guide focuses on the organization and operation of an environmental education program to meet this goal. The guide includes guidelines for developing both the feeling aspect of attitudes, which includes self-image, social responsibility, and environmental appreciation, and the understanding aspects of attitudes which include the natural biophysical environment and man and his relationships with the biophysical environment. The guide outlines environmental education as a process based on  three levels of student learning experiences: discovery and inquiry, evaluation and problem identification, and problem solving. A table is included to further illustrate the environmental education process. A listing of areas in the community and on the school site suitable for investigation, suggestions for environmental evaluation and identification of improvement opportunities, and related activities are included in the guide. The guide concludes with curriculum considerations such as the organization and implementation of an environmental education program and teacher in-service workshop. (TK)",

        "description":"A comprehensive community environmental inventory is an ongoing process of investigation and study to compile and evaluate information about the natural and man-made environmental features and characteristics of an area, as well as related social, political, and economic information. Such information is important to the community in developmental planning and in preventing and resolving environmental problems and it is important in serving as a local basis for an environmental education emphasis in the school. Section I includes a general overview of the uses and procedures involved in a community environmental inventory. Section II outlines the importance of natural environmental features and characteristics as a basis for the assessment of natural areas and their importance to  one another. Section III identifies human environmental use areas and characteristics. Section IV provides guidelines and information for evaluating the natural ecological effects of human environmental use and the degree to which these areas meet human needs; and guidelines for identifying, interpreting, and evaluating ecological values of land, air, water, plants, and animals. The related social, political, and economic aspects of the community are considered in Section V. Section VI provides sources for inventory information. (TK)",

Habitation Patterns encompasses the generalization that change is often the result of many forces. The history and growth of the U.S., 1492-1900, is developed in three sections: 1492-1783, colonial America; 1783-1860, the U.S. as an emerging nation; and 1860-1900, the growth of a capitalistic society. Objectives, activities and strategies, materials, and expected outcomes are also included. The Economic and Technical Development of the U.S. encompasses the generalization that differing ways of life tend to compete for available resources. This theme is broken  into five sections: 1492-1783, 1783-1860, 1860-1900, 1900-1945, and 1945-1971; activities and strategies, materials, and expected outcomes are identified for this theme. The Changing Role of Government encompasses the generalization that the government of a society is closely related to its values; even so, no government can satisfy all groups all the time. This theme is broken into the same five sections as above. Policies, plays, background information, tests, and references are included in the appendixes. (TK)",

The University of Wisconsin-Superior and Northland College have been studying, since 1972, water quality in the streams draining into Lake Superior from Wisconsin in the Ashland, Bayfield, Douglas, and Iron County areas. At Superior, the group responsible for the water quality study has been the Center for Lake Superior Environmental Studies. At Northland College, the group responsible is composed of members of the biology, chemistry, and geography departments. This report is aimed at those people in the Iron County area who are  interested in water quality. Included are comments on the present water quality of the south shore region, what kinds of interrelated decisions are going to have to be made in northern Wisconsin in the next ten years, an overview of national and state water quality standards, and a specific description of the water quality in Iron County. The report also identifies public interest groups and organizations that offer help on water quality problems. (BT)",

An employer survey instrument was utilized and yielded a test sample of 96 employers of Bachelor of Technology graduates. A second survey sought information from the program directors of existing Bachelor of Technology programs in the State. Other sources of information included professional journals, reports, and relevant papers, together with data available from federal and state agencies. The main issue concerned the need for additional Bachelor of Technolgoy degree programs. Findings showed that even the terms, Bachelor of Technology and technologist, suffer from lack of definition. It was concluded that the State does not need expansion of  career-oriented programs based on elusive definition, and there is need for rigorous evaluation of existing programs.

After a discussion of definitions, types, and purposes of math labs, the first paper concentrates on their historical development in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from their inception in 1967 through 1972. Despite continued interest throughout this period, actual numbers declined rapidly after 1970. Several reasons for this decline are cited. Several projects are reviewed; specifically discussed are problems, solutions, and results. Although generally pessimistic regarding the future of math labs, the author mentions several innovative movements as possible reversing trends.  The second paper reviews research on math labs and activity learning, describes ways to employ math labs most effectively, and discusses some apparent effects on student achievement and attitudes (specifically, achievement gains in less able elementary children, with no effect on attitudes). This paper is followed by an extensive bibliography. The third paper critically analyzes seven specific project evaluations--their data collection techniques, types of analyses, and results. Following a discussion of difficulties encountered, the author makes some suggestions, based on the need for individually tailored evaluations. (CR)",

The purpose of this paper is to develop a taxonomic vocabulary and a model for portraying instructional strategies. Instructional strategies are defined as sequences of two or more instructional displays. To describe individual displays, eight variables are identified: content type, content mode, content representation, mathemagenic prompting, response conditions, response mode, response representations and mathemagenic feedback. Various parameters are suggested for each. To describe the relationship between displays, quantitative and sequence specifications and a class of qualitative interdisplay relationships  are suggested. Manipulation of the qualitative relationships is considered to be the factor that affects instructional effectiveness and efficiency. The proposed theory and accompanying flow chart conventions should have value in any discipline for the development of instructional theory, the synthesis and interpretation of research, the analysis of existing strategies, and the design of materials and systems.

A phase boundary for water would be the difference between water and ice, influenced by pressure and temperature. Similarly the phase boundary between war and peace is influenced by national strength and stress. Although the measure of strength and stress is difficult, stress- and strength-related variables can be identified and studied. Also, examined over a long period of time, the system shows four \"phase conditions,\" distinguished by the probability of peace or war: stable war, unstable war, unstable peace, and stable peace. A categorization of variables not completely analogous to stress and strength, but of use conceptually, are (1) the components  of a threat system--size of war industry, use of threats in international communication, for instance; (2) integrative patterns of trade, communication, tourism, or diplomatic relations. Yet, the dynamic processes which carry the system from one point to another must be considered. All these processes involve a change in perception of the world. A widened area of stable peace has been the result of a long cumulative learning process about the nature of community and the strength of integrative bonds. This process is facilitated by all intellectual attempts to understand it. (JH)",

Designed mainly for use with children in grades 4-6, the material is adaptable for use at other grade levels. The document, Part 1 of three installments of which the balance will be published at a later date, is in loose-leaf format to allow for future inclusion of Parts 2 and 3. Part 1 focuses on investigating visual devices. A model consisting of the following three major components is presented: Pre-Instructional Exercises, Diagnosis and Prescription, and Post-Instructional Exercises. Pre-Instructional Exercises include a series of questions  for five levels of investigation, a variety of question styles, allowances for pupils whose learning styles are predominantly visual-oral, a systematic way of assessing the level at which the pupil is having difficulty, and suggestions for the selection and use of visuals. The Diagnosis and Prescription component consists of suggested activities for students experiencing difficulty in operating at certain levels of investigation. Post-Instructional Exercises feature a systematic reassessment of skills developed using a different visual. Adapting this model, a teacher can develop similar exercises using other kinds of visuals such as pictures, slides, graphs, tables, maps, and time lines. (Author/JR)",

One way of securing such value clarification is to plan and assign value sheets--carefully planned and written activities designed to elicit value clarification patterns of language usage from students. Six different formats of value sheets are presented including the standard format, the forced-choice format, the affirmative format, the rank-order format, the classification format, and the criterion format. Each sample value sheet is designed to be used with a social studies unit focusing on the Bill of Rights, the topic of justice, or the concept of due process. Every value sheet contains at least two elements including the social and scientific context  which describes an event that occurs or has occurred and is the focus of the student value clarification. In addition, there are eliciting questions in the form of discussion starters to provide a frame of reference for the teacher and guide the students toward their value clarification. These examples demonstrate that value clarification lends itself to logical and systematic thought. (Author/DE)",

Self-concepts, racial attitudes, racial identification, and sex-role typing were tested in groups of black children from an integrated urban area in Detroit, an all black small Mississippi town, an all black urban community, and a small African and Indian subsample. The results indicated that children in all four samples had good average self-concepts. The children from Mississippi had higher self-concept scores than those in Detroit. In Mississippi, children who scored high in self-concept also were more accurate in the use of appropriate race labels. Children in all the four reference groups saw  themselves more positively than they felt they were perceived by their mothers, teachers, and peers. All four groups had similar racial attitude scores, indicating a white preference. There were no differences in racial attitudes between regions. The data support the idea that there is not a linear relationship between racial attitudes and self-concept. It indicates that black children have been able to compartmentalize their views of themselves. While feeling good about themselves, they still maintain a preference for white attributes. (DE)",

Looking ahead in the social studies field, it seems evident that social studies teachers will have to accept a task of community education in addition to their task of classroom education. Teachers will have to appear on public platforms, take part in public groups, and in general carry on a program of education of the public with respect to the nature of the social studies and the nature of the issues they wish the students of the schools to be become competent in analyzing. Three principles that arise from the nature of the public school as a social institution are discussed in the first part of this paper: (1) the people have a right to  know the rationale and content of what is offered in school; (2) the role of the public schools concerning conflicting beliefs is referee, not antagonist; (3) the one doctrine the school shall insist on is the rule of reason. The second and major portion of the publication contains guidelines to help educators in coping with actual or potential community controversy. The guidelines are arranged in three groupings: those having to do with broad community matters, those pertaining more specifically to the introduction of new programs, and those dealing with response to attacks.

Nine hundred and eighty teachers in California, Colorado, Connecticut, and Texas responded to and returned the 15-page questionnaire. Findings show that only 42 percent of the teachers use the materials,  with the highest percentage coming from Connecticut and the lowest from Texas. Holt Social Studies Curriculum is the most widely used, while Patterns in Human History is the least. Teacher characteristics affecting utilization include holding of a permanent contract, professional status, membership in professional organizations, and location of school.

Summary discussions following each presentation include the diverse opinions of the Rungstedgaard group as to the proper approach for teaching about conflict and security. Appendixes provide a list of participants, materials for the teachers, and some addresses for teaching aids and information. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"Four factors which affect the status of African Studies in the southeastern United States are: (1) the largeness of the South as a geographical area, (2) lack of concentrations of African-oriented scholars in the region, (3) the relatively new addition of African Studies to southern university curriculums, and (4) the frequent involvement in African Studies of persons from outside the South. Existing patterns of cooperation involve the regional disciplinary associations, interdisciplinary cooperation at the regional level, and activity at the state level. The regional association showing the highest interest is the Southeastern Division of the Association of American Geographers while the Southern Economics Association has shown the least. Most state wide activity in African  Studies is at the University of Florida African Studies Center. The current level of interest in organizing a regional association of Africanists among persons teaching about Africa in the Southeast demonstrates a marked contrast to what has taken place. In response to a survey of southeastern Africanists, 95 percent of the respondents believe that a regional organization would be of value. As a result arrangements have been made to establish this organization. The three leading priorities are the establishment of a newsletter, organization of panel discussions at regional disciplinary association meetings, and the organization of an annual meeting. (DE)",

The course is divided into six procedural points. First, students decide which contemporary problems they want to study and then form a panel with other interested students. Second, the group researches their given topic in the library. Third, students break the topics down into subtopics and assign a specific one to each member of the panel. Fourth, each student reads, analyzes, and summarizes 10 primary sources on the particular subtopic. Fifth, the students present their individual research to the panel for suggestions and  possible additional research. Each student prepares a short oral presentation on his individual topic. The panel then organizes the individual oral presentations into a group presentation to be given before the entire class. Sixth, the final presentation is given, including an introduction, various presentations on subtopics, and an overall conclusion based on the results of the research. (Author/DE)",

Internationalization, as investigated by the committee, consists of lending global perspectives to curricula in higher education. The reasons for internationalizing were found to be primarily the need for international cooperation in solving problems that affect all nations, such as resource allocation, and secondarily to prepare students for vocational duties requiring international perspectives. In this context the committee's final report considers Sweden's whole education system, the educational goals that must be realized to bring about  internationalization, the schooling on which higher education builds, teacher training, the problems involved in introducing new goals, administrative and functional changes needed in universities, exchange of teachers and students, and models for internationalization of course content. Proposals are included for two theme courses that might introduce or conclude an academic course of study and for specific courses in the humanities and social sciences that might serve as models for other areas like law and engineering. Special emphasis is given to courses for &quot;training in professional languages,&quot; that is, the use of foreign language learning as a means toward internationalizing the vocational potential of university graduates.

The practice in analytical thinking necessary to achieve this objective requires practice and exercise over a long period of time. Economic education and education in the other social sciences must, therefore, be introduced in the early elementary grades. The fundamental ideas of each social science discipline should be taught at each grade level beginning in kindergarten or grade 1. As the child moves from grade to grade, each concept is taught in greater depth and complexity. This paper identifies eight fundamental ideas for building an economic curriculum. How these fundamental ideas of economic knowledge can then be related to the child's  experiences is discussed in detail. Specific games and class activities are discussed. The fundamental economic concepts discussed should be useful to secondary educators as well as to those at the elementary level. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"This speech explores the gap between curriculum theory and curriculum practice. It begins with a discussion of Joseph Schwab's pursuit of \"the practical\" in curriculum theory and then searches for a basis for \"the practical.\" Schwab's theory involves two parts: \"deliberation\" as the process of dealing with a problem before taking action and \"the eclectic\" linking of theory to practice by consideration of the \"whole\" of what may be involved in any particular curriculum problem. Schwab's theory is seen as a means for resolving epistomological problems. Schwab is likened to a film maker who pursues an unrealistic goal but creates a fascinating film. In the second portion of the speech a teacher's daily curriculum activities are the starting point in the search for Schwab's \"the  practical.\" Curriculum theory has a difficult entry at this practical level, while deliberation appears to be an academic procedure. This is because everyday curriculum decisions are typically unreflective and based largely on routine and taken-for-granted expectancies, such as the teacher's, not the students', opening class each day. Scientific method takes the back seat to unreflective thinking. The gap between theory and the practical is isolated as the rift between the language of theory where deliberation reaches logical ends and the language of the practice where decisions result from myriad and often nonlogical causes.

        "description":"A significant problem with inquiry teaching is that too much emphasis is placed on inquiry as a logical, scientific, and rational way of knowing. Feelings and mood are rarely dealt with except in rather off-handed remarks about intuitive leaps and creative encounters. Few consider what a model of inquiry based on mood and feeling might look like. The purpose of using inquiry strategies is to train students in the formulation of bold conjectures as well as the process of severely testing those same conjectures. It is most essential that these conjectures be bold but not necessarily rational, logical, or scientific. Rationality is identified with four features which include a formal set of rules, use of language, clarity for its own sake, and the connection of results with other  test results. This conception of rationality dominates all thinking about inquiry at the expense of other forms of knowing. What was begun with good intentions has become a straitjacket around the development of expressive thought. The need for allowing feeling and mood to become a part of classroom inquiry becomes more apparent when some of the recent research on the functioning of the human brain is considered. The right side of the brain deals with appositional functioning and expressive thought as in the production of art, music, and poetry. Since social science teaching is predominantly rational, one function of the brain is being unused in social science education. According to the author, rational thought in inquiry teaching should not be abandoned but integrated with more  nonrational thought processes. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"The Religion in Elementary Social Studies Project (RESS) at Florida State University provides an opportunity for determining the effectiveness of an innovative curriculum in religious study. The project stresses objectives dealing with sensitivity, empathy, and tolerance as well as information about religions. Two second grade level classrooms at the Florida State University Developmental Research School reflected similar student characteristics in religious affiliation, nonaffiliation, age, race, sex, and intelligence. One classroom was exposed to the RESS materials. In an effort to understand fully the dimensions of religious tolerance in the life of the young child, awareness of religion, ethnocentrism, and personal experience of religion were explored in both classes to  determine the relationship of the factors to religious tolerance. Field test results indicate that the new information provided by RESS, the classroom atmosphere, the teacher as a role model, and the influence of peer pressure combined to result in higher religious tolerance scores for the exposed group. The child with a high awareness of religion scored even higher on the tolerance test after exposure. Children with high tolerance scored lower on the ethnocentrism test after exposure. Children active and inactive in church and Sunday school experiences tended to have higher tolerance scores after exposure. Results of this case study suggest that curricula may be designed to successfully affect attitudes. (Author/DE)",

Sources and limitations of the data are presented in the report. The graphics section contains charts and graphs depicting some of the phenomena of the education system in Guatemala. The 70 major tables are divided into sections on demand for education, enrollment, schools and classrooms, teachers, public funds, materials and welfare services, special training, teacher utilization, movement through the system, unit costs, utilization of physical plants, and specialization of students and graduates.

        "description":"The concept of consumer participation is discussed as a new basis for the organization of a school and as a general basis of organization for all types of services. A service consumer might be involved as a general consumer around the service, as an active participant in service delivery to other service consumers, and as one directly engaged in service production. An illustration of the latter type of involvement is cross age teaching where an older student teaches a younger one. This involvement results in consumer intensive service, which in the case of students means that students participate in and govern their own learning. Management practices consonant with consumer intensive service are identified. For instance, mechanization and bureaucracy are not viewed as helpful  practices while vouchers and program planning and budgeting systems may be. Consumer boards and the use of ombudsmen and indigenous workers are particularly helpful practices. An evaluation schema for consumer intensive service that overcomes the multiple difficulties encountered in the evaluation of services is suggested. A successful evaluation would require positive findings on a battery of indices for cognitive, affective, longterm, and proximate goals. The ultimate effect of consumer participation is viewed as qualitative improvement in productivity. (JH)",

        "description":"This syllabus for an \"issues\" approach to an introductory economic principles course evolved out of three years of experimentation at Oklahoma State University. The syllabus covers 11 important social issues: population growth, agriculture, higher education, crime, pollution, health, poverty, discrimination, unemployment, inflation, and the energy crisis. Each issue is treated as follows: (1) points for discussion are presented; (2) these discussion points are followed by a listing of the economic concepts and principles explained and applied in the discussion of the issue; (3) the essential aspects of the issue, the economic analysis of the issue, and what can be done about the issue are recapitulated; and (4) assignments are made from several books which are designed primarily  for an issues-oriented principles course. Five schedules in the appendix suggest ways to integrate an \"issues\" approach into introductory one-semester courses taught with a principles text and a supplementary issues text. An evaluation of the course indicates that an issues approach does not adversely affect economic learning and that students favor the course. This syllabus is the first of several that are being published by the Joint Council on Economic Education to provide alternative approaches to \"the\" introductory course. (JH)",

In this issue &quot;elementary&quot; or introductory economics taught at Vanderbilt University is described. It relies on two techniques: case method and self-paced instruction. Self-paced instruction is seen to provide mastery of economic principles while case study reinforces theory by applying it. The rationale for the course and the components of the course--techniques to ensure mastery learning, evaluation plans, use of proctors, record keeping, cost vs. benefits, course adaptations, and choice of textbooks--are spelled out in the introduction. The bulk of the document consists of the course syllabus and study guides for each of  the 10 self-paced sections and for the final examination. Included in the appendixes are an example of a case study, an article on developing independent problem-solving ability in elementary economics, and textbook alternatives keyed to the self-paced syllabus. Also provided in the appendix is &quot;The Case Method in an Otherwise Conventional Course,&quot; a course description containing instances where case study is incorporated in a lecture class.

The main thrust of TCP is to develop a model, self-renewing, learning community through the creative use of human resources for disadvantaged schools. The focal point of this document is the interrelationship of the school and the community in a tutorial program involving parents and other students in cross age tutoring. Outcomes of the project include shared planning and decision making, increasing involvement of the PTA and student council, and other methods of student involvement and  leadership development. Academic achievement increased through the individualized instruction program. A dissemination strategy was developed, based on the TCP helping-relationship model, to focus support on innovative, model schools that, in turn, have the obligation to adopt sister schools and help them develop similar programs.

Objectives of the study were to find out the extent to which teachers have heard, examined, and received  instruction in the use of project materials, and, further, to identify significantly related variables, sources through which teachers have heard about the materials, and the extent and use of materials in social studies courses. Data were obtained from a random selected sample of schools by means of a survey questionnaire. Findings show that only one of the projects has been heard of by more than 50 percent of the respondents; that respondents who teach a subject dealt with by a particular project are more likely to have heard and examined that project; that projects producing interdisciplinary materials have a high percentage of respondents having heard of the materials; and that even for the most widely used project only 20.2 percent of the respondents report using the materials.

Section 1 describes the period between World War I and World War II when European governments tried to enhance their prestige and policies by means of cultural propaganda. Section 2 analyzes the period during World War II when the cohabitation of several exiled governments in the United Kingdom led to the impetus and development of both bilateral and collective forms of cultural diplomacy. The third section deals with the cultural diplomacy of specific countries including France, Italy, the Federal German Republic, and the United Kingdom. French cultural diplomacy is presented at the model, and an attempt is made to show how the other three countries vary from that  model. Section 4 examines the collective experiences of three groups of countries in the field of cultural diplomacy. Attention is first given to the largely homogeneous group of five Nordic countries, which evolved a practice of collective cultural diplomacy among themselves. By way of contrast, the seven countries of the Western European Union including Belgium, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France, Luxembourg, the Federal German Republic, and Italy exhibit a system of collective cultural cooperation worked out to implement a clause of a treaty after World War II. The third group whose collective experience is examined is the 21 member Council for Cultural Co-operation and its Conference of European Ministers of Education established in 1961. (Author/DE)",

The papers reflect the varied objectives of a group trying to introduce a new element into school curricula. The president of the Royal Anthropological Institute states the case against teaching anthropology earlier than university level. The rebuttal to this opinion argues that students need to know of alternative cultural modes as they make life-time choices. Four papers discuss the contribution that anthropology makes to the studies of politics, geography, economics, and sex education. Another paper illustrates the use of songs as a medium for anthropological and sociological  instruction. Two papers representing a &quot;critique of anthropology&quot; discuss the qualities of anthropology that distinguish it from the other social sciences. A study group on teaching anthropology, after hearing from several people already doing so, present some objectives and guides for anthropology instruction. Study groups considering curriculum content for those studying for the Certificate of Secondary Education and for the &quot;O&quot; level exams for university entrance present outlines of important concepts and applicable books in anthropology. Finally, the Teaching Resource Project of the Royal Anthropological Institute is described. (JH)",

        "description":"This study assesses the degree of influence that the elementary curriculum project &quot;Man: A Course of Study&quot; (MACOS) and its process approach has on the use of teaching strategies of first and second year elementary teachers. The sample teachers had been enrolled in an undergraduate social studies methods course that used MACOS. Of the 17 teaching strategies associated with MACOS, 12 were used by 60 percent or more of the teachers. Five teaching strategies were used by 47 percent or less of the teachers. The vast majority ranked MACOS as highly influential in their choice of teaching strategies. The teaching strategies used by the greatest number of teachers were comparison and contrast, learning by observing, organizing by theme or concept, small group discussion, and large group  discussion or working group. The subject areas outside of social studies which most used MACOS strategies were science, math, reading, and language arts respectively. Only two strategies--use of student feedback questionnaires and non-narrated movies--were not used by a majority of the surveyed teachers. Over half the teachers indicated that MACOS had a positive effect on their thinking about what constitutes a good subject curriculum, attitudes on how children should be taught, and how greater cooperation can be developed in the classroom.

        "description":"In October 1970 the Commission on Civil Rights published its first evaluation of the federal government's efforts to end discrimination against the nation's minority and female citizens. This document, third in a series of six, evaluates three federal agencies and determines how well they have done their civil rights enforcement jobs. The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), the Internal Revenue Service of the Department of the Treasury, and the Veteran's Administration are evaluated. They have the responsibility for preventing discrimination against minorities and women in public and private elementary and secondary schools, institutions of higher education, and on-the-job training programs which receive federal assistance. The findings of this report show that  although some actions by the agencies have been useful, inadequate efforts have been made to deal with a number of major problems concerning civil rights responsibilities in the area of education. For example, a number of deficiencies exist in the overall compliance effort for HEW, including problems with sex discrimination, pupil transportation, metropolitan school desegration, faculty selection criteria, and failure to take prompt action when problems are identified. In this report, each agency is evaluated in the areas of the responsibility of each organization, the organization and staffing, and compliance mechanisms. A number of recommendations for the improvement of those programs which require change are outlined. (Author/JR)",

The paramount emphasis was two-fold: (1) to provide teachers with an indepth exposure to the methodology utilized in the inquiry process via lectures and demonstration lessons, and (2) to provide teachers with a concentrated and systematic program approach to ethnic studies in the K-12 social studies curriculum. The authors of the 13 articles in this document were the consultants for the program. Articles deal specifically with American Indians, Jews, and black Americans in United States history, as well as general ethnic concepts. The document also contains strategy models and practical considerations for effective  inquiry teaching. Other topics deal with cultural pluralism, the melting pot theory, the theories of Christopher Jencks, and a critical assessment of the Kerner Report. The use of community resources and school community relations in ethnic studies concludes the work. (Author/JR)",

The scale is composed of three subscales which measure whether students view the humanities class as an enjoyable experience, the study of humanities as being worthwhile, and the humanities of the past as being a legitimate part of history. Scoring is based on a scale of 1-6 under categories of strongly agree, agree, slightly agree, slightly disagree, disagree, and strongly disagree. Each question is worded in either a positive or negative manner. If a student marks \"strongly agree\" to a negatively worded question he receives one point, where if he marks \"strongly disagree\" to a negatively worded question he gets six points. Subscales 2 and 3  are designed so that they may be administered independently of subscale 1. This allows them to be used in a pretest-posttest design for evaluation purposes. Interpretations of possible test scores and general discussion as to test reliability and validity are included. (Author/DE)",

Sample populations included an experimental group enrolled in an interdisciplinary inquiry course. Control groups comprised students enrolled only in a philosophy course in inquiry, students not enrolled in either course, and inservice teachers not enrolled in either course. A testing instrument rated the concepts of \"myself as an inquirer\" and \"myself as a teacher in the conduct of inquiry\" and opinion on the nature of inquiry. A summary of the findings concluded that the experimental inquiry group perceived (1) their inquiry teaching selves as more open to and pleased by the social stimulation of the inquiry mode of teaching, (2) themselves less  comfortable as inquirers than did students in the philosophy of inquiry course, (3) the nature of inquiry as more truthful and perfect than did any of the other groups, and (4) the nature of inquiry as less structured and more responsive than the other control groups. Under the assumption that behavior follows perception, instruction of this nature is valuable for teaching any inquiry oriented discipline. (Author/DE)",

This entails in particular a greater rationalization of the complex educational process. This report is the result of comparative studies of the curriculum in Western Europe and analyzes civic and social education into six areas: the  social, moral, political, national, European, and world citizen. The author also deals with the socialization process, the role of secondary education, general aims and goals of civic and social education, teaching methods and resources, and evaluation methods for such a curriculum.

The purposes of BAYCEP are to develop a series of programs which will encourage the use of China-related materials in elementary and secondary schools and improve the methods and content of precollegiate teaching about China. BAYCEP staff members work as consultants to Bay Area elementary or secondary teachers who request their help. In addition to consulting, BAYCEP staff develop materials useful to teachers; two available products are an annotated bibliography (ED 092 469) of easily available materials on China and a short unit entitled Misunderstanding China (ED 092 421), focusing on the dispelling of stereotypes.  The unit is highly adaptable and can be modified to meet the requirements of almost any classroom situation. For teachers who wish more indepth background preparation on China, BAYCEP conducts workshops in both content and additional teaching techniques. While BAYCEP is currently focusing on China, the associates hope to expand their services on other countries, with the next concentration to be Japan. (Author/JR)",

Textbooks and other resources are used to supplement the daily issues of the St. Louis Globe-Democrat received at the school. Learning activities and the role of the newspaper vary in each classroom. The newspaper's use is limited only by the teacher's imagination. Teachers sometimes use the newspaper as a major instructional tool while at other times they use it as an enrichment and motivational technique. Students use all aspects of the newspaper from headlines to advertisements, sports statistics, and current articles. For example, a number of students in a fifth grade class play the market each day. A Trans World Airline advertisement is used in  kindergarden classes to identify airlines that are alike and those that are different. A primary group uses the same ad for studying arrival and departure times and drawing the times on faces of clocks. Special education, music, and art teachers also find the newspaper useful. An evaluation of the program indicates that it is successful. Using the information presented, interested teachers can adapt this program into their own curriculum. (Author/JR)",

The topic under discussion includes two questions: (1) What do young people need to cope with the problems of a complex society and themselves? (2) Where and in what ways can opportunities be made available to provide this need? Much of the discussion concerning what is made available to help young people cope is bound up with the issue of how one deals with the acceptance of variety. The discussion focuses on the family which recognizes and respects separateness and on adults who deal with young people and bring a whole variety of backgrounds and behaviors to the relationship. The opportunity for youth to understand the  process of goal-attainment is integrally related to how individuals learn to respect differences and deal with competing needs. The ability of schools and institutions to provide opportunity to cope revolves around how they deal with variety, whether they demand conformity and stereotype racial or socioeconomic groups, or whether the institution allows youth to participate in the school's development program. Institutions can meet young peoples' needs only by respecting individual development and self-concept. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"This document is one of a series by the Youth Development Center at the University of Minnesota dedicated to the discussion of youth. Thirteen participants from various social science fields were asked to present a perspective on youth from the viewpoints of their profession or discipline. This dialogue, an edited and restructured version of the discussions, provides an overview of the whole subject of youth. Out of the discussion came six general ideas which may be of help to people working with youth. These ideas include the need for adults to acknowledge youth's cry for personal, individual recognition and their general need for affection, self-respect, and a sense of personal worth. In addition, adults need to present to youth educational alternatives that do not prolong  dependence and separate youth from other age groups, and ways in which youth can participate in the democratic decision making process in schools and society. Adults must provide youth with models of committed, reliable, and honest relationships between people. Finally, adults must stress the idea that the search for identity is a continuing process through adulthood and does not require the attainment of a singular viewpoint but requires continual questioning and evaluation.

        "description":"Preschool children participated in a classical music program to determine the effects of the program on their auditory discrimination skills. The development of auditory discrimination skills, considered a leading factor in reading readiness, is one of the objectives of the music program. Other objectives include emotional growth, experience in dramatic play, a broadened knowledge of music, fun and enjoyment, and development of increased attention span, direction-following skills, and cognitive skills. Seventy-seven five-year-olds, divided into experimental and control groups, were the subjects of the study. Weekly musical experiences for the experimental group grew from 20 to 50 minutes in length as the school year progressed. At the end of the program all children were tested  using the Metropolitan Achievement Test, Slosson Intelligence Tests, and Wepman's Auditory Discrimination Test. The results showed better developed auditory skills for the experimental group and greater ability to handle instructional tasks. In addition, music learning appeared to cut through all teacher-observed I. Q. levels and maturity and age levels, and the children never tired of hearing the works. The usefulness of these results for curriculum developers wishing to integrate affective and skill level behaviors is suggested in the study. (JH)",

Questionnaires were sent to state superintendents, state directors of certification, executive secretaries of regional accrediting associations, deans of schools of education, and certification classroom teachers to collect data on these issues. An analysis of the data identified the following six major conclusions: (a) diversities in decision-making structure, requirements  for certification, academic preparation of teachers, and types of certificates exist among the 11 states; (b) influences on certification that are registered within the scope of the study could be classified under broad categories; (c) all respondents favored change in certification requirements; (d) teacher education programs were viewed as being responsible for competency development of teachers; (e) several state departments are investigating the potential of competency-based certification; and (f) certification is related to teacher effectiveness.

One nonthreatening method that might be used by teachers to evaluate and improve their classroom performance is self-appraisal. The experiment in this document uses the Teacher Self Appraisal (TSA) observation system which divides the teaching act into three categories: (a) methods, (b) objectives, and (c) expressions. By video taping classes and using these categories, it was hoped that the teacher would be able to recognize deficiencies and improve performance. Six tapings were made at two-week intervals, and after each session the tape was viewed and analyzed. Stops were made at 15 second intervals, and the teacher determined what was going on according to the above categories.  The tape was then analyzed in terms of the teacher's goals for the class. In this particular case, the teacher was able to identify various deficiencies and problems after viewing the tapes. By the time the last tape was finished (and after much effort towards self-improvement on the part of the teacher) a definite improvement was obvious.

The main difference--the inability to hear words and sounds--can be overcome by cooperative work between the teacher and the interpreter. The interpreter can do much with what the teacher says and is able to convey feelings, sentiments, emotions, and enthusiasms. But the teacher must remember that the interpreter is present and adjust his/her presentations accordingly. In special situations such as group discussions, demonstrations, or small project work the same applies, but some unique procedures must be utilized. This is also true for evaluation where a teacher sometimes must make a special effort to receive feedback from his students. A training and  orientation program for teachers new in the field of teaching deaf adults is especially helpful, and it is hoped that most communities will realize that \"teaching is not merely talking.\" (PB)",

The package is divided into four tasks. Task 1 states that most students don't realize what it is they should be trying to learn and consequently are not as likely to learn it. It emphasizes that though there are many drawbacks to having teachers decide learning goals, this does not mean that immature students should have sole responsibility for what they learn. Assumptions are outlined that lay the groundwork for procedures that allow students to participate in instructional planning. Task 2 tests the reader's understanding of Task 1. Task 3 outlines the steps used for pupil-teacher planning. Recommendations are made  that the unit be somewhat familiar to students, not overly difficult, and one which comes early in the year, so that the planning experience can help later on. It suggests that the teacher first introduce the topic and explain what types of questions are \"good\" questions. The students might then form small groups and formulate questions for that particular topic. After a list of questions is made, the students should choose those questions they are interested in working on; class time should be provided for this work. At the end of the unit the teacher should evaluate the process with the students. Task 4 includes a test of Task 3, a pupil opinionnaire, and the suggestion that if this process cannot be applied to a whole unit, just one lesson could be used. (PB)",

Piaget's model of cognitive development was used to determine the general goal of teacher training in preactive skills, to identify the three basic kinds of preactive skills necessary for teachers to learn, and to suggest the kinds of instructional processes to achieve the goal of changing the cognitive functioning of teachers so that they begin to move from the concrete operational level of development toward the formal operational level in their preactive teaching behavior. The three basic kinds of preactive skills identified were generating alternatives, selecting among alternatives, and altering existing circumstances. Specific behavioral objectives subsumed to each of  these skills are presented. The instructional processes suggested to achieve these goals capitalize on the developmental processes of socialization and equilibration. The types of training materials to be developed to implement these processes provide background information on new instructional alternatives, simulated data on the given affecting instructional decision making, and peer interaction regarding contradictory instructional decisions.

The fundamental job consists of a basic change in the character of the school system itself from a middle-class situation to a more representative one, and intensive teacher training programs aimed toward building teacher respect for disadvantaged children and their families. Because the school system is failing these students, the tutor becomes very important. To help the student, the tutor must know something about the culture of the low-income person and the students' way of learning. Most of these students benefit tremendously if they can learn by seeing, touching, feeling, and doing. A teacher's style is also important, and these students seem to be  most attracted to \"informal authority.\" A tutor can greatly help the disadvantaged student by teaching him/her some of the \"know-hows\" of the school: how to take tests, how to listen, how to study. There are many types of teaching technology that may have special value for low-income students including the use of \"hip\" language in formal lessons. This can be done, for example, by presenting poems using the language or compiling dictionaries of \"hip\" words. Another aspect is the whole area of students helping each other. Our schools are certainly not perfect, and these disadvantaged students can contribute an enormous amount toward helping us change them. (PB)",

In organizing the curriculum, the staff decided that the teacher needed competencies in: (a) specifying educational objectives which reflect issues relevant to education and to living in our modern-day democracy; (b) determining conditions of the learner in relation to the specified objectives; (c) selecting, preparing, and using appropriate materials, activities, and reinforcements for the learner; (d) organizing and managing the variety of learning  environments which promote individualized instruction; and (e) evaluating students to determine if mastery of the educational objectives has been achieved. The teacher curriculum is organized into competency packages which, together with large- and small-group instruction, and field experiences, constitute the learning blocks in which the student enrolls. After completing the learning blocks (which include one afternoon a week as a teaching assistant in the public schools), the student may apply for student teaching.

The group of participating teachers receiving questionnaires included all those who worked with or had in their classrooms undergraduate teacher candidates during the fall 1972 semester. Perceptions of field experiences from teacher candidates were quite favorable overall--especially in effective communication with pupils and participating teacher-teacher candidate cooperation. However, it was  evident that more opportunities to plan instruction and increased contact with guidance personnel and with parents were needed. Participating teachers received questionnaires in which they rated teacher candidates on 13 behaviors likely to occur in the school. Results were divided according to level, initial experiences, subsequent experiences, and student teaching. The results indicated the following. Overall, ability to maintain proper relations with the participating teacher was very highly perceived, but the reciprocal giving and taking of suggestions was not so highly perceived.

It is argued here that when diffuse or ambiguous environmental pressure for substantial change are combined with a differentiated structure, the frequent result is that organization participants develop vague, symbolic agreements. These are particularly likely to develop when there is considerable time pressure. Such agreements tend to conceal potential goal conflicts and leave technical details unclear. Attempting to implement symbolic agreements then results in unforeseen technical difficulties and conflict, frequently leading to rejection of the innovation. The paper concludes with a discussion of some alternative approaches to innovation that may help  readers avoid these difficulties.

Part 1 introduces the Health and Optimum Physical Education project and explains that this project operates under the premise that movement education contributes to a child's total development. In part 2 four concepts are identified as the foundation for efficient and effective movement, and the way in which each can be integrated into a movement education program is explained. These four concepts are space awareness, body awareness, quality of movement, and relationships. In planning a program based on these concepts, teachers must assess student needs, establish broad goals to meet those needs, develop a long range planning schedule (so that one area is not overemphasized), and make daily lessons plans. (Sample lesson plans are given).  Part 3 deals with teaching methods. Teachers are encouraged to examine all alternatives and choose the one(s) best suited to their goals. Examples in games, gymnastics, and dance are given to demonstrate what processes can be used to achieve objectives. The appendix includes health forms and lists of movement process categories, audiovisuals, and equipment. (PB)",

Students were tested during the 1971-72 and 1972-73 school years. A random sample of 15 percent of the student population of each sex in each grade level was given the written test in 1971-72. The sample was increased to 30 percent in 1972-73. All students received the physical performance test, and a random sample of 30 percent by sex  in each grade level was used in 1971-72; 50 percent was used in 1972-73. Students in the sample demonstrated sizable and statistically significant improvement in both the areas of physical fitness and motor skills, in both sexes, and throughout the 8 grades.

        "description":"The present controversies concerning competency-based/performance-based teacher education (CB/PBTE) are not new. The scientific approach to teaching, in the form of Herbartian theory, was prevalent at the turn of the century. At the same time however, Dewey's ideas on teaching the whole child and teaching as an art were beginning to enter into educational thinking. Presently, the scientific orientation seems to be more popular, but there are several factors that will determine its fate--and perhaps portend its doom. CB/PBTE uses a single-track model. This leaves little room for imagination and creativity on the part of the teacher. It utilizes a single philosophical approach and fits the student into a mold instead of allowing the student to use a model which he/she, has  developed to fit his/her personality and which is congruent with his/her own philosophy. Although advocates of CB/PBTE claim they achieve objectivity in their programs, the subjective judgment of the program developer(s) plays a major role at every step in the program. Finally, CB/PBTE is a technical-mechanical process, and because teaching deals with human beings, it can only be a technical-mechanical undertaking to a very small extent. Teacher education must be as flexible and diverse as the pluralistic society it seeks to serve. (PB)",

Massive inservice education programs may become necessary for school districts to equip teachers to cope with this change. Staff development in many school districts often consists of a lecture or speech by some \"expert\" on instructional problems. A better path is the use of systematic instructional techniques and methods on instructional problems. Since universities usually do not have well-planned programs that have been developed with the training of inservice teachers in mind, it would be advantageous for school districts to use programs that have been developed and validated through funding from the U.S. Office of Education. There is an excellent program  available in many areas of the country that was developed by the National Media Institutes Consortium under a contract with the U.S. Office of Education. The program is a five-day intensive training institute that makes use of simulation, games, media, discussions, and programmed materials to train teachers in the use of a systematic approach to curriculum development.

Formal, explicit school programs, as well as learning experiences provided by peculiar social organization features of schools, are of demonstrable relevance to the study of psychological modernity. At least 10 modernity studies have now empirically established the formal education process as the most important variable effecting modern orientation in individuals. Two findings are particularly striking: (a) consistency of correlations among age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES), and other background items; and (b) remarkable consistency of the  findings within countries where studies have overlapped. In all the studies, it was found that the longer individuals are exposed to school, the higher their modernity scores. The data show mixed findings concerning the influence of schooling on personality modernization when controlled for sex, SES, and measured academic performance. The implications of modernity findings for the role of schooling in the development process are dependent on the unexplored nexus between modern attitudes and values and their behavioral manifestations.

Evaluation of process was conducted by means of cyclical interviews; product evaluation consisted of teacher attitude and achievement, measured by observation, tests, and/or questionnaires. Tentative conclusions derived from this study will form the basis for program revision. A significantly more direct relationship was found to exist between student attitude and teacher competency, and between student attitude and teacher attitude  in the experimental group (those beginning teachers working with cooperating teachers) than in the control group. Principals in systems using cooperating teachers rated their first-year teachers significantly higher than did those in systems not using cooperating teachers. Control teachers (those without cooperating teachers) tended to be more authoritarian and to view education as a rigid coverage of subject matter.

Anxiety was assessed by means of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Eighteen members of the Ithaca College women's varsity gymnastic team were tested throughout the 1973-74 competitive season. Regression analysis revealed that past performance loaded most heavily in the prediction equation. Arousal and anxiety measures were of relative unimportance in the regression equation. Any attempt to predict gymnastic performance without taking into account past performance would be folly. (Author)",

Furthermore, it was planned to ascertain whether schools were using standardized forms or systematic procedures to formulate school health policies. Administrators in school districts representing every geographical area of the U.S. were asked to send any written material available in any area of school health. The greatest number of separate statements concerning health policies and procedures were identified under the following categories: health services, administrative responsibilities, first aid and emergency care, health of school personnel, environmental health, and communicable disease prevention and control. A considerably smaller number of policies were identified and  classified under the areas of provisions for handicapped pupils; safety and accident prevention; qualifications, requirements and selection of health teachers; transportation policies; school lunch programs; and health instruction. The lack of definite policies and procedures in health instruction was considered particularly appalling.

        "description":"Many problems are involved in interdisciplinary teaching. Below are some proposals for an interdisciplinary course in the social sciences for secondary school teachers. This type of teaching can be done with either one instructor or a team. If one instructor is used, care must be taken not to build the course solely around that person, so that if s/he leaves, the course disappears. The instructor must have a strong interest in developing interdisciplinary courses, and be willing to spend a substantial amount of time reading material from other fields. There are at least two ways to deal with subject matter: (a) use specific problem areas as case studies, where emphasis is on methods used to arrive at answers, and (b) include games with a strong interdisciplinary flavor. If a team  of instructors is used, new problems arise. The team must be closely coordinated and each member must have a fundamental appreciation of the other disciplines. One way of organizing the team is in a panel which meets with every class. Another way is for instructors to teach individually, but to work together on a selected topic for a given period of time. If commitment is made, any of these proposals is workable. It is felt, however, that one is more likely to find a single individual strongly committed to the interdisciplinary movement. Although flexibility is lost, commitment may be more important. (PB)",

The schools attempted to utilize a number of generalizations potentially applicable to the educational change process in the implmentation of their competency-based instructional systems. Curriculum guides developed by the schools were major tools in implementing the philosophy of competency-based education. Curriculum guidelines have been field tested, revised, and disseminated, and inservicing is  taking place.

The delivery system includes the field based, community oriented setting, on-site instruction, a clinical/resource supervisory support system, and a  mechanism for continual evaluation. Efforts are being directed to examine closely the relationships between learning theory and classroom practice, between societal sensitivity and individual values, and between the roles of the teacher in the teaching/learning setting and the learning behaviors of students.

Although generalizations concerning this program's contributions to the improvement of teacher education are difficult to assess, some projected contributions may be mentioned. First of all, the program puts faculty back in contact with the real world of public education. Second, the presence of a classroom teacher in a department of education provides students and faculty with the opportunity to interact with someone recently involved in an actual classroom or administrative position. Third, interaction on common problems will hopefully achieve a new level of communication  among all involved. Finally, those involved have the opportunity to act as change agents by bringing new skills and perspectives on education to their regular positions.

Among the basic premises which implicitly define education and the association between education and development, the following three stand out as being particularly misguiding: (a) the view of education as a system, (b) the belief that the burgeoning demand for jobs and privileges for which education is prerequiaite can be met only by offering more education, and (c) the belief that educational planning and administration can provide solutions to problems of educational inequity, inefficiency, and irrelevance. These premises have been promoted by the popularity of educational planning, which has not provided satisfactory solutions to the ever-widening development  dilemma. Because of this, educators are turning to the study of educational innovation--to a functional rather than structural view of education. Some of the most expressive, yet least understood innovations are those occurring at the grass-roots level. These innovations usually promote goals outside the dominant system and seek a different form of education and society. The way in which development and education are viewed in grass-roots social change in Brazil is of particular interest. To the peasant or slum dweller, development is a concrete notion, not an abstract model. The term \"education\" in Brazil places the ultimate value upon human dignity, suggesting that development must be defined as an interaction between individuals and society. (PB)",

It is hypothesized that reexamined objectives have indicated a need for greater emphasis in affective-social psychological areas. Staff development within such a context consists of teacher selection, teacher assignment, teacher development, and teacher release. Teachers hired should possess characteristics consonant with the determined goal. Measuring these characteristics can be done through inventories and interview techniques. Teacher assignment is very important since teachers are almost always more likely to maintain a better, less hostile atmosphere in the calssroom if they are content in their position.  Another element of this phase can be labelled psychological education, i.e., the use of counselors in a classroom role. Teacher development involves self-help (in the form of classes, clinics, or workshops) and supervision (an important element frequently overlooked). The final phase is teacher release. Many administrators have been reluctant to remove ineffective staff members--a policy which has been largely responsible for the charge that schools are places where teachers work, rather than places where children learn.

A major fallacy of CBTE programs is that they are based on the following implicit assumptions which have little theoretical or empirical support: (a) that there is much more agreement than the literature indicates on the goals and purposes of education, the competencies derived from these goals, and the timing and sequence of pupil competencies; and (b) that is a specific set of goals and objectives could be agreed upon, a valid set of corresponding teacher competencies could then be derived which promote these objectives. Evaluation of CBTE programs presents a second series of problems which include level of competence measured, the relationship of the measure  to the particular competency, quality of the evidence, and isolation of factors which contribute to the achievement of the competencies. Despite these limitations, the University of California at Berkeley CBTE Programs will attempt to evaluate their programs in terms of the achievement of objectives and competencies, ongoing processes by which objectives are achieved, unplanned outcomes, and student background.

There are ways, however, by which schools of education can avoid disastrous results. These include the following: (a) eliminate nonproductive programs and courses, (b) retrain faculty in areas of declining interest for employment in growth or stable fields, (c) offer elective courses which appeal to noneducation majors, (d) plan new programs based on existing faculty and physical resources, (e) recruit faculty with flexible, broad-based academic preparation, (f) develop cooperative programs with other academic departments,  (g) lobby for more favorable and equitable funding, (h) consolidate and integrate training programs among institutions producing a small percentage of teachers, and (i) prepare students for two or more career options.

During phase one, students fulfill the following course requirements as they relate to their field base: (a) complete separate observational and instructional field experience; (b) construct individualized learning packets; (c) develop teaching strategies; (d) microteach; and (e) analyze teaching behavior. During phase two, the student undertakes independent study and assists with the instructional or activity program at the field base. During phase three the student progresses through four developmental levels: adjustment, support, lead, and  independent teaching. During phase four, the graduate is aided in job placement, and professional consultation and resources are available in the design of instructional materials and teaching strategies appropriate to the new program.

        "description":"A student teacher has very limited authority in the classroom and his/her position with regard to the law remains obscure. Very few statutes concerning student teachers' legal status exist, and there are even fewer court cases involving student teachers. (Specific statutes and cases are cited.) There are, however, numerous legal problems that both teachers and student teachers may have. These problems generally fall into one of the following four categories: (a) classroom discipline, (b) pupil injury, (c) controversial matters, and (d) teachers' rights. This paper presents both actual and hypothetical cases within each of the above categories involving student teachers and the law. Measures should be taken by each state to seek legislation clearly setting forth the legal status  of student teachers and to issue some type of \"preliminary certificate\" which would provide the student teacher with clear legal rights. Teaching training institutions should also provide students with a law course that would deal with problems he/she might face while student teaching. (PB)",

Problems exist at all levels in accreditation, licensing, and identifying eligibility for federal funds. No set standards have been established and there is little communication between states concerning these topics. This Council recommends the use of federal funds to bring about improvements in staffing, training, and the effectiveness of these functions. The system should be as self-enforcing as possible. The following are criteria for establishing such a system: (a) schools and colleges must publish the standards and rules by which they operate; (b) an agency (perhaps the state licensing authority) should be set up to receive students' complaints; (c) the system should  start quickly, although there will be a series of intermediate steps to make it more effective; (d) an effort should be made to develop the competencies and performance of those persons charged with operation, safeguarding, and improvement of the system; (e) by informing students of their rights and providing an agency to deal with complaints, students can act as monitors in the system; and (f) a center should be established to create a system which would be synergistic rather than fragmented.

They are applicable to programs which propose to enhance ethnic identity or cross-cultural understanding among any one or more of these three ethnic groups. These modular measures do not require reading ability; rather, they are based upon pictorial stimuli and response options. The directions are particularly appropriate for elementary school programs involving children who may differ culturally and linguistically. The fifteen stimuli for each scale are graphic illustrations of the dress, sports, foods, and popular symbols of the Puerto Rican, Anglo-American, and Black-American cultures,  respectively. The child indicates his attitude toward each pictorial stimulus by marking one of five faces on a happy sad Likert-type scale. There is also an alternate response option indicating no knowledge of the particular cultural referent. Each scale thus yields two scores: a cultural attitude index and a cultural knowledge index.

The task requires decent descriptions of the behaviors, appropriate statistical tools and measures of student outcomes that are worth while examining. The data, collected in the course of an evaluation of the relationship between the organizational structure of schools and student achievement, is not entirely appropriate for the issues dealt with here. Therefore, paths are suggested that this research might take in the future: (1) it is possible, using multiple regression analysis, to construct models of teacher behavior that reflect the view that some set of teacher behaviors affect  student outcomes, and (2) these models can be applied at least three distinct ways, depending on the kinds of assumptions that one is willing to make about the data and the kinds of questions that one wishes to address.

Although the particular results are probably of interest only to that university, certain aspects of the study should be of general interest, because, of the 3,237 students comprising the sample, 1,241 were classifiable as Spanish-surname individuals. Comparisons of the regression equations resulting from using SAT scores and high school quartile rank to predict freshmen grade point average indicate that different equations are necessary for different classifications of students. Since these data were obtained from an educational environment created by a semi-open admissions policy and thus represent no  restriction in the range of SAT scores, the results of this study may be of special interest to individuals and educational institutions who deal with similar populations.

Marcy Open School, one of the alternative elementary schools, offers flexible curriculum, scheduling and age grouping, with emphasis on helping children to learn to think and to make independent judgments. As part of a goal evaluation for the 1973-74 school year, a children's interview was designed and divided into two sections, (1) children's perceptions of choices of activities available to them during a school day, and (2) children's perceptions of the contributions of themselves, of adults, and of peers to the school  environment. The same questions were asked of six of the ten classroom teachers to reveal their perceptions of the day. Results of the interview are presented in diagram form and confirm that children at Marcy School understand that they have many possible choices during the day, and that they, their teachers, and peer group, contribute to the academic and social setting of the school.

Proficiency measures that focus on task outcomes (product) normally provide data relevant to the first purpose, whereas measures of how the tasks are carried out (process) pertain to the second. Time or cost factors sometimes preclude the use of product measures, leaving measures of task process as the only available criteria for evaluating training outcomes. Instances in which process measures are typically substituted for product measures are described in this paper with reference to the types of tasks for which the substitution is valid and those for which it is invalid.

The choice of a test to be used will depend on the type of decision to be made. Several decision types are discussed: program planning and evaluation, screening, and administrative decisions. After considering the type of decision to be made as a factor in test selection, several test characteristics should be considered: practical criteria, including relevance, scope, timeliness, importance, efficiency, and credibility; validity--content, discriminant, criterion, content, and edumetric; test  reliability; and test bias. Cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains are discussed in relation to determining what kinds of test characteristics are important in assessing for a particular educational decision. Some strategies which offer effective ways to obtain more ecologically valid assessment data are presented along with comments on other testing methods, human rights, and achievement tests. (RC)",

These suggestions are consonant with recommendations of various professional organizations composed of psychologists, counselors, and educators; the guidelines prepared by a conference sponsored by the Russell Sage Foundation in 1970; and numerous court cases which have established legal precedents on the release of test data or confidential information.

        "description":"Traditionally, local school boards have had the power to assign students to classes and to set standards for promotion and graduation; with this authority has gone the discretion to decide what role pupil testing will play in the local schools. Courts have been reluctant to interfere with school board decisions on methodology, of which they consider testing to be a part. They will intervene, however, when a constitutional right is affected by board policy or practice. They have done so consistently where racial or ethnic discrimination was involved in pupil testing. Children are given standarized tests on numerous occasions throughout their public school careers. In addition to standardized tests, teachers prepare and administer tests in various subjects. However, this paper is  concerned primarily with standardized tests, since it is they that have been attacked in the courts. Each type of test that has been dealt with in court cases is treated here. Specifically, they are: group and individually administered intelligence, aptitude, and achievement tests. (Author/DEP)",

        "description":"After an extensive review of the literature concerned with evaluating career objectives, a literature with little cohesion, six areas were isolated as crucial indices of the adequacy of career education. These areas are: (1) self-awareness, (2) career-awareness, (3) decision-making skills, (4) overall school behavior, (5) career competencies, and (6) career attitudes and interests. Measures in all six areas should be obtained for the evaluation of career education programs. Preferably, measures should be obtained through experimental and quasi-experimental designs with pretest data, rather than case study methods. One advantage of using an experimental design is that resulting data is quantitative and may be statistically analyzed. Special emphasis is given to the equality of the  control group with the experimental group because of validity problems related to the maturation bias. The importance of research follow-up is also stressed. Guidelines and recommendations are offered to reduce the amount of error in the evaluation of career education programs. (BJG)",

They provide a stimulating review and perspective on the state of policy and reform possibilities in income maintenance and the welfare system. In his paper, \"The Role of Income-Conditioning in the American System of Transfer,\" Robert J. Lampman notes that between 1960 and 1973 public social welfare expenditures increased from 52 billion dollars to 215 billion dollars. In addition, there is a growing set of private transfers to persons. The scope and scale of this system have grown particularly rapidly since 1964. Lampman points to a few of the more remarkable changes of recent years. The changes selected for discussion were all designed  to concentrate their benefits on families in relatively low-income status. The recent moves toward more income-conditioning of benefits suggest that advocates of a simple, straight-forward negative income tax with a moderate tax rate in it are caught between a rock and a hard place. In his paper, \"Reflections on Recent History,\" James Tobin suggests six lessons we can learn from the dismal legislative and political history of tax and welfare reform in recent years. Alice M. Rivlin and Alvin L. Schorr discuss several aspects of these two papers. (Author/JM)",

Their monograph, Negroes in Cities, reported a number of analyses of residential segregation and neighborhood change, utilizing segregation indexes and a variety of other measures derived from census data. In 1971, The Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin embarked on the task of updating to 1970 and in other ways extending these earlier studies of racial residential segregation. Segregation indexes for 109 cities for 1970, together with the previously published indexes for the three earlier census dates, are presented in Table One of this paper. The trend data for 1940 through 1970 refer to residential segregation of  whites and nonwhites. For 1970 only, segregation indexes are also presented comparing whites and Negroes. The indexes for 1970 were calculated from Public Use Summary Tapes issued by the Bureau of the Census. Certain difficulties were encountered in use of these tapes for this purpose. A methodological appendix describes the data source and retrieval procedure for calculation of city segregation indexes for 1970. To permit quick dissemination of the indexes to other researchers, this paper is issued without substantive analysis or interpretation. (Author/JM)",

The program included an Academy in the Creative Arts, an Institute in Mathematics and Science, a school for the Humanities, and 11 summer junior high schools that offered remediation and enrichment as well as repetition of previously failed courses for pupils. The implementation of these objectives was facilitated by 11 junior high and intermediate schools offering a basic program: two in Manhattan, three in the Bronx, and six in Brooklyn; and by three specialized schools in Manhattan. Each of the 11 schools was to service approximately 300 to 1,000  students per school and was required to provide instruction for pupils who were retarded in reading and mathematics; provide intensive, small group instruction for pupils who had failed in one or more academic subjects during the school year; provide enrichment through non-credit, non-academic courses in industrial arts, music, typewriting, and library services; provide enrichment in literature through non-credit instruction for pupils reading on or above grade level; and to teach English as a Second Language to foreign-born and non-English speaking children.

In its resolution the Council sought to emphasize the need to include social aspects of housing in the development plans of countries. The Group was requested to provide advice regarding the underlying judgment that certain forms of residential segregation have damaging social and economic consequences and are inimical to the well-being of individual citizens and classes of populations; to national development; and to international  harmony. The phenomenon of segregation was examined in terms of causes, effects and strategies. It was observed that segregation occurs at every level, from the international economic division of rich and poor nations to the personal isolation of an individual. The experts felt that planning had suffered from an overemphasis of technical and economic considerations at the expense of social values. They arrived at specific recommendations for the encouragement of social integration through housing policy. (Author/JM)",

Petitioners answered that the aid sought by respondents exceeded Title I's requirements and contravened the State's Constitution and state law and public policy. First Amendment issues were also raised. The District  Court denied relief. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded. Held: (1) at this stage of the proceedings this Court cannot reach and decide whether Title I requires the assignment of publicly employed teachers to provide remedial instruction during regular school hours on the premises of private schools attended by Title I eligible students; (2) the Court of Appeals properly declined to pass on the First Amendment issue; and, (3) under the Act respondents are entitled to comparable services and therefore to relief.

        "description":"During the last two decades, there has been a great increase in the use of litigation by social reform groups. This activity has been stimulated by the hospitality of the courts to the demands of social reform groups and the availability of subsidized young, activist lawyers. The paper examines the uses of the legal system by social reform groups and the problems that groups have in enforcing changes in legal rules. Three types of litigation strategy are discussed: (1) defensive, where the group, its leaders, or its members are being prosecuted; (2) subsidiary, where litigation is used in aid of other strategies; and (3) affirmative, to accomplish the primary objectives of the group. Most problems occur in implementing affirmative litigation. Four types of enforcement problems  are analyzed: (1) Enforcement involves massive lower-level official discretionary decisions; (2) Enforecment involves massive private discretionary decisions; (3) Enforcement involves continuous inputs at key regulatory agencies; and (4) Enforcement is countered by a strong recalcitrant government defendant. The paper concludes by explaining the empirical results in terms of recent behavioral theories of social reform groups. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The Education Park is designed to provide special facilities and services for community groups. By community groups we mean not only adults or those who have completed school, but school-age children regardless of their school affiliation who can reach the Education Park to utilize its facilities after the normal day school hours are completed. The principal means by which community personnel will be served at the Education Park is through the creation of an extensive youth and adult center. This center will provide a combination of recreational, avocational, and quasi-academic activities. Formal academic offerings will be provided through the following kinds of school organizations: (1) after-school study centers; (2) evening high school; (3) community education centers; and (4)  summer school programs at the primary, intermediate, and high school levels. The total pupil capacity planned for the Northeast Bronx Education Park is 10,400 pupils. To provide more manageable numbers of pupils at each of the three levels, it has been decided to organize units at each school level. Pupils within each unit will remain in it for the duration of their stay at the school level (primary, intermediate, or high school) and will take the majority of their school program including their physical activities and lunch, with other students in the same unit.

        "description":"The housing crisis in the United States is primarily urban. Unlike areas of urban blight, rural alums are not slums of despair by any means. \"Slums of despair\" is a term used in a recent study of urban life to describe those areas in some of our inner cities whose inhabitants feel they are utterly trapped--that they stand little chance of improving their lot. In the study, these desperate regions were contrasted with so-called \"slums of hope,\" where there was some visible evidence that government or the community was committed to building new housing or rehabilitating what existed, as well as to creating jobs. This book is concerned with the ways in which America's hopeless slums might be turned into healthy communities. In city after city, the reduction of housing stock has far  outstripped the total construction of new housing. The reasons for this erosion of badly needed low-rent housing are complex. Housing subsidies--which means, primarily, subsidies for land acquisition, mortgage interest and rent--are absolutely essential if new housing is to be created to meet the needs of low-income families. But successive administrations and a Congress not particularly responsive to urban problems have cut back and will continue to cut back such subsidies, and so these indispensable programs are dying on the vine.

        "description":"Recent research results strongly suggest that the theoretical problems of change measures have limited practical significance for measuring individual growth, and it is important to determine whether this is also the case for measuring school impact. Accordingly, in this study artifical data were used to assess the correlation between several estimates of average student change in various schools and the \"true\" impact of the same schools. Because it seems desirable for artificial data to resemble real data, the computer procedure was designed to reproduce selected aspects of the Educational Testing Service Growth Study and of the Project TALENT study of high schools in the U.S. Results indicate that all estimates involving pretest-posttest differences measure school impact with  reasonable accuracy. It is important to measure change over the entire course of learning, however, and not just over the later stages of learning. The correlations between change scores and other school characteristics reflect with reasonable accuracy the relationships between those characteristics and impact, but will be large only when the underlying relationships are substantial. Simple gain scores measure the true situation about as accurately as other change estimates, are easier to compute, and probably are more meaningful to nonresearchers. (Author/JM)",

More specifically, the author (1) lays out a simple proximate explanation of the way in which family size, birth order, and child spacing should influence a child's subsequent attainments by governing the time and other inputs he or she receives; (2) transforms these three dimensions of family structure into a single quantitative family-inputs index; (3) tests the link between sibling position and achievement within families as well as across families; and (4) presents calculations suggesting the order of magnitude of  the impact of improved contraception on the subsequent inequality and level of a cohort's educational and career attainments. It turns out that the link between sibling position and achievement is significant even when age and parents' attributes have been held constant. The impact of improved contraception on the distribution of achievements in the next generation turns out to be as important, or possibly more important, then would be inferred from past studies. The family-inputs index emerges as an important variable for future studies. (Author/JM)",

National Assessment's (NAEP) principal objective is to assess the changes over time in educational achievement of four age groups in the U.S. In addition to the national  results for each age group, results are reported within each age level for certain major subpopulations, such as geographic region and sex. To do so, NAEP had developed two baseline measures: (1) an estimate of the percentage of persons in each of the populations who gave a certain response to a specific exercise, and (2) an estimate of the difference between the performance of a subpopulation and the performance of the total age population. Measures of change will reflect comparisons of these statistics over time. (Author/JM) Primary type of information provided by report: Procedures (Overview).",

The pilot project was subdivided into two parts. Part One, the Camp Learning Center Project, proposed the establishment of interdisciplinary educational, interracial, and cultural experiences in a camp setting for 1100 sixth grade pupils. Each child was enrolled in the program for a period of 13 weeks. During the first six weeks the children and their teacher planned the activities they would conduct at camp. The students prepared for this experience by studying a variety of subjects that would help them accomplish their goals. The children spent the seventh week at the Camp Learning Center, from Monday morning to Friday afternoon. While at camp,  the children participated in group study, individual tutoring, and recreational and social activities. Following the camp week, the students continued their studies in their chosen areas and evaluated their camp experience for the final six weeks of the program. The major purpose of Part Two, the Bicultural project, was to reduce isolation and educational problems related to non-English speaking pupils and pupils with first language interferences. Thus the project proposed to extend services which would meet the needs of immigrant pupils and aid them in making proper adjustment in their learning situations. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Migration is generally conceptualized in terms of &quot;streams&quot; and &quot;counterstreams.&quot; A stream is a group of migrants having a common origin and destination in a given migration period. The movement in the opposite direction is called its counterstream. The latter is usually the smaller of the two. A counterstream can be divided into two components: first time movers to an area (Primary Migrants) and return movers (Return Migrants). The purpose of this paper is to examine the feasibility of the differentiating between primary and return migrants within the Black countersteam, that is, Black migration to the South. A counterstream migration of Black people to the South has existed for many decades. The Census data indicates this counterstream has been steadily increasing from the  first data available in 1935-1940 through the 1973 data from the Current Population Survey. As part of a larger study of Black migration to the South, the data for this analysis were derived from the Public Use Tapes of the 1970 Census of Population and Housing. Given the nature of selectivity in migration, certain socio-demographic and socioeconomic factors have been selected for analysis. The variables presented for analysis correspond to those variables showing themselves as useful measures of distinctions between migrant groups: age-sex relationships, marital status, education, income, and occupation.

Among the  priorities are: (1) Allocation of public school funds based on needs. (2) Establishment of bilingual/bicultural programs for all children whose English-language deficiency prevents them from effectively taking part in the learning process. (3) Affirmative action to recruit and train Puerto Rican and other Hispanic personnel for professional positions in teaching and related support services.

A mechanistic conception of intelligence leads to the definition of objectives as a collection of fragmented \"cognitive skills\" that have little to do with children's development of intelligence. A Piagetian conception, on the other hand, leads to attempts to develop children's intelligence as an organized whole. Intelligence is not something that we can educate separately by pasting it onto the child. It is rooted in the biological origins of a whole organism and develops as a highly interdependent whole. Our comprehension of reality, or the way in which we understand reality, precedes and largely determines how we react to it.  Whatever specific objective we may define in education must, therefore, support and enhance qualities such as autonomy, so that intelligence can develop as a coherent, powerful whole. If we want this intelligence to develop into something powerful enough to overcome the natural human tendencies to see reality in terms of emotional needs and to accept easy ready--made answers, we must educate children to deal logically with reality itself. By compartmentalizing academic skills and separating them from the development of intelligence, schools too often produce passive students who wait to be told what to think next. (Author/JM)",

The evaluation focused on the assessment of the degree of accomplishment of product objectives for each component of the program. The program had a total enrollment of 244 students--161 Portuguese dominant students and 83 English dominant students. The program served 119 fifth grade and 127 sixth grade students. Fifth grade English dominant students were selected for the program from the fourth grade student population who would normally be going into the fifth grade during the 1973-1974 school year. Fifth grade Portuguese dominant students were selected through  consideration of two factors in addition to their language dominance--school age and neighborhood. The sixth grade students are last year's fifth grade bilingual students. The staff included the following personnel: project director, staff development specialist, English as a Second Language Coordinator, guidance counselor, parent-community coordinator, four curriculum specialists, 12 teachers, four teacher aides, and an audio-visual materials development assistant. The average class size for the 12 classes--four each at the three participating schools--was 20 students per class. (Author/JM)",

By shifting our focus, however, to incorporate both Latin American cities and North American cities in previous stages of their history it should be possible to increase our understanding of the distribution and nature of poverty as it depends on urban structure. The research reported here is based on 1953 and 1963 data on Puerto Rican households collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Certain tentative conclusions were reached: (1) As compared with the U.S., Puerto Rican poverty is less closely linked to stigmatized  demographic status. This may be due to the absence of blacks. (2) As is the case in the U.S., Puerto Rican urban residence serves to somewhat ameliorate poverty. This seems to be due both to higher wages and to public assistance. (3) Family size and sex of head are the principal determinants of income among the poor. Sources of income vary slightly by area in the magnitude of their contribution. (4) The urban poor spend relatively more on housing and less on clothing than rural residents. There was no evidence for an urban &quot;mass consumption&quot; effect. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This research guide is designed to help people who are working on the development of new educational programs for public schools. By outlining some of the major questions and problems that relate to research of new programs and by suggesting some practical steps, this guide attempts to aid planning groups in the use of research techniques. Research requires consideration of how information is collected and analyzed. The researcher considers the effect of the research approach itself on his conclusions. Before developing a research plan, the basic reasons for doing the research must be clarified. Once the overall questions of the research are clear the next step is to determine what approaches to the collection, analysis, and presentation of information will most productively lead  to the research goals. The uses, limits, and costs in terms of time and money are indicated for each approach discussed here as well as some suggestions for implementing that approach. Once the information is collected, the analysis of the information will determine the quality of the conclusions. Much of the best analysis of new school programs has been done by program participants who have had no formalized training in research. The choice of how to present research conclusions should be based on your audience as well as the purpose for presentation. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The 1970 Census showed that we Americans are an urban people. Seven of every 10 U.S. residents live in metropolitan areas: 3 in central cities and 4 in suburban areas. The movement to the suburbs swelled to high tide in the 1950's. Although it abated somewhat in the 1960's, it reached an historic height in 1970. In April 1970 there were 203.2 million inhabitants in the 50 States and the District of Columbia. Almost 70 percent (nearly 140 million) lived in the 243 SMSA's; 32 percent (about 64 million) lived in the 308 central cities; and 37 percent (nearly 76 million) lived in the suburbs. Although overall there was a small gain in population for central cities between 1960 and 1970, a great many cities actually lost population. If past trends continue, nearly half of the American  people will be living in the suburban portions of our metropolitan areas by 1985. And one-third of the central city population will be black by 1985, compared with one-fifth at present. We can expect the greatest growth to be in middle-sized SMSA's, those that now have between 500,000 and two million inhabitants. The old image of suburbia as a fringe of \"bedroom communities\" is fading. Satellite communities, complete with most consumer--oriented facilities and services once located exclusively in the city, are springing up to serve the rapidly growing suburban population.

        "description":"One person in five--42.4 million Americans--belongs to youth, viz. those who are 14 to 24 years of age. The 1970 census showed that there were 1.8 million Spanish heritage young Americans between 15 and 24 years of age. The number of white youth is estimated to be 36.6 million. The estimate for blacks and other racial minorities was 5.8 million in 1972. In youth, the population balance between the sexes is almost even. In 1970, for example, the census showed that there were 19.6 million men and boys among youth and 19.9 million women and girls. The 1972 estimate of 42.4 million youth was higher than the 1970 census total of 39.5 million Americans 14 to 24. Population growth accounts for the difference between these figures. Overall, the proportion of all young Americans enrolled  in school or college in 1972 was 55 percent. Statistics hint at the Nation's preoccupation with young America--one of five belongs to youth, educational attainment going up, income an important fraction of the whole income spectrum, 44 percent on the move in one year, older at first marriage, and so on. Perhaps, though, the recent stress on youth is lifing. Declining birth rates since the late 1960's suggest a somewhat different future for youth. Not better. Not worse. Different, along with the good that always comes with being 14 to 24 years of age. (Author/JM)",

About half of us live in just three metropolitan areas. 1.2 million of us--90 percent of our total--live in urban areas. Our median family income is higher than ever before, and for most of us, it is higher than the 9,596 dollars which was the national median in 1969. The 1970 Census showed that 182,000 or 48 percent of our homes were owned or being bought by the families living in them.

The community of Arlington, Massachusetts, has two satellite junior high school programs  operating in two separate locations. Each accommodates 100 youngsters in grades 7 and 8. Worcester, Massachusetts has so many alternative school programs that they have been combined under one administrative office. Basically, these alternative programs break down into two categories--General Alternative Programs and Specialized Alternative Programs which are designed for &quot;school phobics,&quot; truants and recalcitrant students. A model for many local alternative high schools is The Home Base School in Watertown, Massachusetts. (Author/JM)",

It will deliberately engineer the way materials are derived and constructed for recall tasks. This study started by eliciting information on a set of categories generated by those who have been consistently shown to cluster and recall relatively poorly--lower class black high school dropouts. They were compared with white middle class parochial high school students on tasks developed from experiences of similar urban black youth. Prior to conducting the recall study, a group of 75 black adolescents living in and  attending school in Central Brooklyn were employed to generate recall materials. Thirty-four black and white adolescents recalled a list of 30 words. There was no significant difference between groups in the amount recalled. Black adolescents clustered more than white adolescents with a high correlation between amount recalled and clustering. Analysis of within list category responses suggests that the &quot;black categories&quot; depressed the categorized recall of white adolescents. The results indicate that cultural origin of materials can alter standard expectations of ethnic group performance. (Author/JM)",

The colleges are both in an urban area with tuition, student enrollment, and course offerings approximately the same at both schools. Their major difference is in the composition of the student body. Approximately 98 percent of the students attending the university are white, and approximately 98 percent of the students attending the college are black. Therefore, it would appear that one of the areas involved in deciding which school to attend is personality. Full-time Negro students at sophomore level and attending the university above formed Group 1, a random sample of Negro students at the predominantly black college formed Group  2, and Group 3, was comprised of a random sample of white students attending the university. Each group was administered both the California Psychological Inventory (CPI) and the Adjective Checklist (ACL). An analysis of the data revealed the black students at the university tended to score more like their white counterparts than like the black students at the predominantly black college. The results for the two black groups were combined and factor analyzed. The factor structure for the black population on the CPI differed significantly from previously reported studies. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The inner city aggregations of blacks, Appalachian whites, and Mexicans are not simply the focal points for short-term instability or remedial governmental programs: they are the first native American urban poor. The poor neighborhoods of America's inner city are a result of three great population movements. One originated in the Atlantic Coastal Plain, the Black Belt and Delta regions of the South, a second in the coal fields of the Cumberland Plateau, and the third in the populous elevated plains of central Mexico. These three areas are superficially distinctive. Yet certain basic social relationships dominate these three areas. These disparate populations all barely subsisted. In each case rural marginality was exacerbated by the encroachment of large landholders and by the  harrassment of their legal and political instruments. The resulting economic marginality and dependency provide the context for the economic and political crises that decimated these areas. It is doubtful that these poor populations would have come to the city if it had not represented hope and escape. The image of the city was actively planted in people's minds by a variety of sources. The poor of five surveyed neighborhoods are subjected to a similar pattern of encirclement, intrusion, and abandonment. These present difficulties emerge from a shared experience with the past.

The first level represents associative learning. The second level involves higher-order conceptualization, and problem solving. The purpose of the present study was to develop a matrix completion training task that could be mastered by either Level 1 or Level 2 processing. The different modes of processing should be reflected in three kinds of performance differences: Initial ability to solve matrices, learning proficiency, and ability to transfer acquired skills. A matrix completion training task consisting of four sets of items, each of which could be solved by using a specific rule, was administered to low-SES and middle-SES  first and third grade boys. Differences between grades were found for the more difficult sets. In these cases, the third grade middle-SES subjects outperformed all of the other groups. For those subjects who reached a learning criterion, all groups performed significantly better on the transfer items. These findings suggest that although there are social-class differences in rate of acquisition, once criterion has been reached there is considerably less evidence that what has been learned is different for different social class groups.

The 90 northern cities in our sample are ranked according to their scores on these three measures. In this report we will first describe how we collected our data, and from it computed a measure of desegregation action from 1964 to 1971. The second section presents the index of dissimilarity of  segregation in each school district. The third section indexes the degree of desegregation possible in each district taking into account the need for politically racial compositions. Then in the fourth section we will look at the amount of administrative action which has taken place in each measured district compared with the above indexes of desegregation. Fifth we present a regression analysis in an effort to explain and predict the differences between cities in degree of segregation. Finally, we look at yearly trends in desegregation in these cities.

Data was collected by a mail questionnaire. The measures of school desegregation policy were computed as follows: The number of black and white students in each school in the year after a claimed action was subtracted from the number of black and white students in the same school in the preceding year. The difference was attributed to administrative action if it increased racial integration in the receiving school. The number of black and white students so reassigned was totaled for the school district and then standardized by dividing by the school population of each  race to obtain the percentage of black students reassigned and the percentage of white students sent to predominantly black or formerly black schools. Cross sectional, multiple regression analysis indicates that school desegregation policy is limited by several socioeconomic constraints. However, in contrast to many other school desegregation policy studies, political variables such as the ideology and behavior of the school board, civil rights activity, and controversy explain a substantial amount of variance in school desegregation policy.

The first and most critical step is to clearly identify the problems that make reform seem necessary. The question then becomes one of identifying the possible solutions and sources of information about them. Then the data must be evaluated from a number of vantage points. The process of reaching a decision to adopt a reform or series of reforms for a school is the fourth step. Most schools will have to turn to higher authority for permission to proceed and, where necessary, additional resources necessary to support the planning process. The process of planning for school reform requires machinery--an organization to which is delegated the responsibility for developing the plan and  that has formal status. It is the job of the planning group to look at the overall objective in terms of the problems identified in Step 1. It then is necessary to translate the results into a written document. Adoption of the completed plan, the ninth step, is a three stage process: acceptance by the school community, revision where necessary to insure community acceptance, and only then submission to and approval by higher authorities. The tenth step is implementing the plan. Change must be institutionalized and an evaluation process organized. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The study sought to use Jensen's two-level theory of mental abilities to predict some hitherto unknown or unnoticed phenomena--facts about which the theory should yield clear-cut predictions and which are not as clearly predictable from other theories, though they may receive ad hoc explanations after the fact. From the two-level theory of mental abilities (Level 1: rate learning and memory, involving little or no transformation of the input; Level 2: complex cognitive processing involving transformation and mental manipulation of input) it was predicted that forward digit span (FDS) should correlate less with IQ than backward digit span (BDS), and age and race should interact with FDS-BDS, with the FDS-BDS difference decreasing as a function of age and a greater white-black  difference in BDS than in FDS. The latter prediction is derived from the hypothesis that the magnitude of racial differences should be a function of the degree to which Level 2 predominates in the cognitive demands of the particular test. The predictions were substantiated at a high level of significance in large representative samples of white and black children of ages 5-12 years, who were given the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (Revised). Supplementary studies found no support for rival hypotheses based on anxiety, task difficulty, and race of examiner. (Author/JM)",

The 10 classrooms were selected as follows: two each in English, mathematics, and social Studies; with the remaining four sampling the range of other courses. The five schools were selected as follows: one middle-class highly academic college preparatory school, one lower class black trade school; one lower class black \"general\" school; one traditional agricultural-community school; and one innovative \"democratic\" school oriented to personal interests of students. The data are the responses of students and teachers on the recently developed Authenticity  Legitimacy Productivity (ALP)-ETHOS instrument; demographic data on each student; interviews with principals; and teachers' estimates of time devoted in class to various activities. The investigation was confined to two questions. Who succeeds in school? What demographic characteristics distinguish high achievers from lower achievers? The broader question was who benefits from school and, usually unexamined, what are these benefits? The second question was: For whom is the school designed? That is, for whom does it provide educational opportunities and for whom does it not? (Author/JM)",

Although primarily concerned with black opportunities in housing, the study investigates Negro opportunities in related areas (education, income, and employment) in order to develop the linkages and interdependencies between the various aspects of equal opportunity. In each area, the opportunities available to doday's black population are determined by comparing: (1) opportunities in metropolitan (and particularly central city) areas with those available elsewhere to determine whether the urbanization of blacks is providing the means for upward mobility; (2) opportunities available to blacks in earlier decades with those now available to ascertain whether blacks are in fact improving  their absolute position over time; and (3) opportunities afforded blacks and whites, it being recognized that the term &quot;inequality&quot; is generally used in its racial context. In analyzing the housing opportunities of metropolitan area blacks, the dissertation explores housing quality, quantity, cost, and overcrowding. Particular attention is devoted to residential segregation. The purpose of the entire analysis is to establish a suitable foundation for making recommendations designed to maximize black opportunities and to relate these recommended policies to urban planning.

Performance data for 14 states was studied for the 1972-73 school year and compared with similar data for the 1969-70 school year. All projects implemented by 112 LEAs during the 1969-70 school year and all projects implemented by the same LEAs during the school year 1972-73 were reviewed. Also all project applications for the school year 1972-73 submitted by 369 additional LEAs in the 14 states were examined. In reviewing the  effectiveness of SEA practices, (1) the extent that LEAs were using Title I funds for meeting the high-priority educational needs of educationally deprived children, and (2) the extent of any improvements made by the LEAs in using funds for such purposes were determined. The LEAs in those states operating under a concept of firm central authority seemed to have made the best showing in using their Title I funds for high-priority activities. Several SEAs however, still have not been successful in convincing LEAs to use Title I funds to the greatest advantage in keeping with program objectives. (Author/JM)",

Many of the things talked about then have been realized: More money has been spent. Better than half of the colleges and universities train teachers for disadvantaged children. More guidance programs have been developed and educational technology obtained. Progress has been made in developing cultural and ethnic pluralism in educational materials. There is a renewed concern for vocational education and career development. But education is not an antidote to poverty. Furthermore, the school is immoral when it continues to hold that as its goal. Schools are one of the resources by which society prepares and develops  its members. When other societal resources are unequally distributed, quality of schooling becomes even more important. When the society produces subpopulations less well prepared to benefit from the standard offerings of the school, we have the additional responsibility for broadening, expanding, and enriching the offerings of the schools, not as our first line of defense against poverty, but as protection against the effects of an unjust society, which, if they go uncorrected, systematically erode the human resources of that society.

At present, the social studies portion of the program, which is undergoing development, is taught through lecture and discussion. The information that the students are studying is concerned with the working man's place in his  home, neighborhood, job, and community, and how all of these facets fit into the state, nation, and the world. The math, English, and technical portion of the program are presented through teacher constructed, individual units. The students are required to complete a written unit on a particular construction objective which incorporates certain math and English skills necessary to fully understand and master the objectives. The students then apply the knowledge gained in the construction of a scaled model of a residential home. (Author/JM)",

A mail survey of some 50 of the nation's largest school districts was made. It was found that the trend toward administrative decentralization has accelerated during the past  five years. Only New York and Detroit have adopted a community control organization model having regional school boards with policy-making and resource allocation authority. Most urban curriculum leaders felt there was much need for curriculum specialists. There was evidence that accountability for curriculum improvement may not have been substantially strengthened. A strong leadership role on the part of regional office personnel has not yet emerged. Considerable effort has been made to obtain citizen participation at the building level. (Author/JM)",

Classes were generally divided into two main groups according to language dominance, and these groups were  subdivided into smaller groups according to ability levels. With a teacher and an aide in each class, small group and individualized teaching techniques were the most frequently used instructional approaches. Class sizes ranged from a low of 17 to a high of 24 students. This report presents the summative assessment. The report first presents the evaluation procedures for program assessment.

One objective was to describe the nature of the following factors which may affect goal striving of the lower-class black youth: mothers' educational aspirations, educational expectations, and occupational expectations for their children; mothers' attitudes about educational and occupational achievement; mothers' attitudes about child-rearing; and cohesiveness of the black family units. Another objective was to determine the extent to which variation in these elements of socialization within the black lower-class populations could be explained by indicators of the families'  relative articulations with American society's opportunity structures. The data utilized were collected in the summers of 1970 and 1971 from black wives residing in nonmetropolitan East Texas and metropolitan Houston, respectively. All respondents were interviewed by black female adults who had been trained by the researchers in interviewing procedure. The nonmetropolitan sample was drawn from a town of about 5,000 population. The metropolitan sample was comprised of residents of an economically disadvantaged, almost all-black ghetto. (Author/JM)",

During the course of the study a number of school districts were visited. In most cases, the superintendent of schools or a high ranking administrator was interviewed. The method of interview was informal. The school district representative was given an opportunity to talk about his district's problems, programs and progress in the school desegregation area. Specific questions were then asked during the course of the conversation covering such topics as minority teacher recruitment and placement practices, extracurricular activities, black and white student relations, communication with black parents and the quality of  education for black students. Part One of this report traces the course of Supreme Court rulings on school desegregation from 1954 to 1974. Tactics used by school districts to avoid integration are examined. Statistical evidence of the extent of integration in Missouri is examined in Part Two. Part Three is a discussion of the results of integration in four areas of the state: Southeast Missour, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Central Missouri. Conclusions of the research are listed in Part Four. The research was funded by the State of Missouri. (Author/JM)",

Recent studies by the authors examined the question of differential time limits and group performance for standardized academic aptitude tests. Both studies deleted items from an experimental section in order to manipulate the speed with which an examinee was required to work. The present study sought to extend the range of culturally defined groups and presented an opportunity to use a more direct method of manipulating working speed. A 27 item reading comprehension section of a national academic aptitude test was administered under two conditions. Under one condition the  section was administered with the usual 30 minute time limit and under the other condition the time limit was extended to 40 minutes. Data for the study were collected in October and December of 1971. The majority of subjects were in their senior year in college. The categories of group membership included black, white, Chicano, and Oriental; male or female. As in the first two studies, the results rejected the hypothesis that allowing more liberal time limits would be more beneficial to minority groups than to the majority group. (Author/JM)",

Of all the nations in the world, only three have larger female populations: China, India, and the Soviet Union. Females made up 51.3 percent of the United States population. Over 70 million American women are of voting age--that's nearly seven million more than the number of men of voting age in the United States. In 1950, only seven percent of women 18 to 24 were in college. By 1970, 20 percent of women in this age group were enrolled in college. In 1970 women made up 40 percent of the work force. The twentieth century emergence of the American woman from the status she historically held is a phenomenon dramatically illustrated in Census Bureau data. She is becoming better educated, enabling her to move up  the job ladder and increase her earning power. With her new independence, she lives alone in her own household if she chooses. The married woman is having fewer children, and the divorcee is remarrying sooner. And she is living longer to enjoy her new opportunities and freedoms. Clearly, the American woman will exert an ever more powerful influence on the destiny of the U.S. as a result of: her increasing participation in the labor force, her growing educational background, her majority in the electorate, and her wishes as to family size, which will determine the nation's future population growth.

Probably the most interesting aspect of the labor supply decision of young people is its interconnection with the decision of how much time to spend in school. The importance of the role of education is reflected here. In the first  section of the paper we present our basic models, describe the data that we shall use for testing the models and discuss our a priori expectations with regard to the magnitude of (and biases in) the various elasticity estimates. In the second section we present income elasticity estimates for married men, single men, and single women. Similar estimates for married women are presented in section three, while wage and substitution elasticities are discussed briefly in section four. The final section contains a very brief summary and conclusion. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"On the twentieth anniversary of Brown vs. Board of Education, it seems appropriate for the Commission on Civil Rights to commemorate the Supreme Court's decision with an examination of the civil rights progress between 1954 and 1974. The first report in the series provided a brief historical background. This second report covers equality of educational opportunity. Among the report's findings are the following: school desegregation has progressed substantially in the South; progress in the North has been minimal; without positive action, segregation in urban areas (both North and South) appears likely to increase, and urban-suburban racial subdivisions will be intensified; most fears about school desegregation have proved groundless, and desegregation is working where it has been  genuinely attempted; \"freedom of choice\" has proved a totally ineffective method of school desegregation; the federal government's commitment to desegregation must include the termination of federal assistance to school systems maintaining segregated schools; desegregation of dual school systems has often resulted in displacement or demotion of black school staff; and, there is evidence that disciplinary action against minority pupils in some desegregated schools has resulted in high numbers of expulsions and suspensions.

        "description":"This report examines two specific feasibility areas: lateral transfer of personnel between the Navy and industry, and short naval careers. During the course of the study, discussions were held with senior representatives of 38 corporations, with labor union officials and with several Navy areas, including the sections of BuPers and the Naval Training Command. The study has been exploratory in nature and has sought primarily to determine the reaction of industry and of labor to the two concepts. The following conclusions are presented: the principle of lateral transfer between industry and the Navy is acceptable to industry; Navy personnel requirements, at least as regards officers, can be fulfilled from the Naval reserve component for the foreseeable future; precedents for  lateral transfer between industry and Navy exist; the lateral transfer of civilians into the Navy postulated during the discussion of the idea with industry does not appear to be workable; short term lateral transfer of Naval officers to industry appears quite workable. Summaries of the discussions with the industries approached are appended. (Author/SA)",

The 100 institute participants, representing 16 states, were ABE administrators and teachers and personnel from other Federally-funded adult programs, who contributed varying experiences and cultural backgrounds. Results of an inventory survey determining vital problems of rural adults revealed five problem areas, which were used to form task force groups for the institute: (1) improving management skills for ABE teachers, (2) problems of consumer education, (3) crucial problems in health and nutrition, (4) identifying and using community  resources and agencies in ABE, (5) interpersonal relations among rural adults. The nine workshop addresses, focusing on various aspects of the five problem areas, are included. Each participant was administered a pre-test and a post-test to determine changes in concepts, attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors. Outcomes of the institute were increased knowledge, skills, and leadership for ABE personnel as well as greater sensitivity for the rural adult learner. A 25-page appendix contains supplementary institute information. A separate follow-up institute study pamphlet is also included. (EA)",

A distinctive feature of the study was that questionnaires were sent to supervisors, employees, and consumers of social services, covering the areas of jobs done, education obtained or sought, social service organizations, hiring and promotion criteria, qualities considered important for effective social work, means and goals of services provided, educational background, and attitudes toward consumers of social work. Rates of return were 37 percent from supervisors (149 of 408), 47 percent from employees  (887 of 1,898) and 33 percent from consumers (188 of 579). A detailed discussion of the returns leads to the general conclusions that: all groups considered social work-related university education the most desirable; employees and their supervisors stressed related experience and educational background equally while consumers felt more importance should be given to related experience; and all groups, especially consumers, stressed the importance of personal qualities in choosing and training social service personnel.

Findings were that: more than 90 percent of the fellows and trainees were employed full-time; more than half the trainees, and 60 percent of the fellows, were employed by a university, more than one-quarter were self-employed; about two-thirds of the trainees, three-fourths of the fellows, were doing some teaching; more than 80 percent of both groups had held teaching or research positions since the end of their NIDR-supported  training; dentistry and dental specialties were the fields of about 47 percent of the trainees and about 54 percent of the fellows; former NIDR fellows/trainees sponsored an estimated 960 other trainees and fellows; about 70 percent of the trainees, over 82 percent of the fellows, felt NIDR-supported training helped them significantly toward their career goals; more than 54 percent of the trainees, and over 62 percent of the fellows, said they could not have obtained the same training without NIDR support.

Part 2 explores recent developments in the licensure of health manpower in the following areas: State studies of licensed health manpower; expanding the role of State licensing boards; licensure and the interstate mobility of health manpower; proficiency and equivalency  testing; continuing education and its relationship to quality of care; developments in institutional licensure; and the foreign medical graduate. It is hoped the document will be useful to the States and professions in planning new and innovative directions in credentialing, will stimulate increased interprofessional communication, and will be the first step toward a comprehensive and unified health manpower policy.

The keynote lecture deals with functional literacy in the context of adult education--results and innovative effects. Other lectures are devoted to Paulo Freire's approach, documentation and international exchange of experiences, and pilot projects for large scale programs as they relate to functional literacy. Three working papers present topics serving as background information for discussion: life-long education; methods; and planning, organizing, and administering--again in relation to functional literacy. Statements were made to the  working groups by representatives from UNESCO, the German Adult Education Association, and the German Foundation for International Development. The working groups' reports regarding functional literacy provide the basis for the Symposium's thirty main conclusions. A brief evaluation report based on participant interviews, the program, and list of participants are included. Reports from nine Arab and African countries are presented and synthesized, emphasizing adult literacy activities. A 17-page bibliography devotes three pages to functional literacy documents and the remainder to selected project materials. (AG)",

The major information was sought from all active cardiologists and all cardiology training programs in the United States and employed the use of questionnaires, log-diaries, content analysis, and interviews. The data furnishes an estimate of present and future manpower needs for cardiologists in the fields of patient care, teaching, and research within the United States. It also provides a description of the current practice of cardiology and identifies deficiencies in existing training programs in  cardiology. Further, the study projects the future activities of the cardiologist, an aid in planning future training experiences for them. Contributors to the study include: W. H. Abelmann, S. Abrahamson, F. H.

The portion of the study reported on in the document proposed to analyze, interpret, and draw conclusions from the responses to a survey questionnaire distributed to counselors in the 10 high schools. The High School Counselors' Survey Questionnaire is a 68-item instrument developed to provide information on the extent to which counselors are providing job development, placement, follow-up  activities, and counseling services for those preparing to enter the world of work. Data collected by the survey are presented in four tables, each followed by an analysis. A final page presents seven recommendations for counselors, to help interested students prepare for the world of work. (AJ)",

The program is designed to prepare high school seniors and early school leavers to make positive transition from school to suitable employment or post-secondary training. The problem studied was to determine the students' need for job development and placement activities and to demonstrate the need for placement assistance within the school setting. Prior activities of students related to work experiences, work habits, job-seeking skills, mobility, preparation for the world of work, and their career plans were required not only for developing future student world-of-work programs but also  for the implementation of the placement program. Data was gathered by use of the Student Career Placement Questionnaire, World of Work Survey, and the Career Plans Survey. Responses to each of the 77 items from the three survey questionnaires are tabulated and grouped respectively; results are reported as percentages, and the means of selected items are reported. Statistical comparisons are made between schools for selected items, and a composite of responses from students in 10 schools gives an overview. (Author/AJ)",

Six program objectives were formulated and served as a core for developing an evaluative questionnaire which was sent to all participants six months following the workshop. The questionnaires were returned and 64 percent of the responses are discussed in relation to the program objectives. Two central questions guided the assessment of the impact of the workshop on  participants and the field: (1) how well did the workshop design facilitate the attainment of the goals established by the planning committee, and (2) how well did the substantive content serve to insure the achievements of the workshop objectives. These questions were examined in relation to 10 aspects of the workshop: recruitment, participant expectations, resource personnel, work groups, plenary sessions, group reports, cognitive achievement, field trips, the black caucus, postworkshop evaluations, and graduate students as project staff members.

All teachers who had participated in summer career education workshops (the professional staff development component) were sampled for knowledge of and attitudes toward career education, personal characteristics, and professional characteristics. The student component, group samplings of grades 4, 6, 8, 10, and 11, measured academic achievement,  vocational maturity, self concepts, selected attitudes, knowledge of occupations, and motivational levels. All system career education coordinators and a sample of classroom teachers (the management component) were interviewed on goal clarification, support for project personnel, utilization of facilities, materials and human resources, and effective administrative procedures. The extensive findings are presented in table form and discussed at length. The recommendations made relate to the findings concerning each component.

An 18-statement questionnaire was administered to 81 city teachers in four elementary schools and 81 county teachers in six elementary schools and one secondary school. City and county teachers were in complete agreement regarding work values, student attitudes, student ability to get along with people, and familiarity with many different careers. Moreover, there was agreement concerning use of resource people, study of student interests and abilities, relating instruction to career development, and  opportunities for vocational skills and work experience. While 75 percent of both groups agreed that the school should prepare all students for careers and assist them in making career decisions, only 50 percent felt the schools should place all graduates in jobs or postsecondary institutions. City teachers were more favorable than county teachers toward guidance and counseling for career development, student followup after graduation, work-related and hands-on experiences for teachers, and student work-study arrangements.

A 25-statement questionnaire (concerning occupational/career interests, communication skills, and work attitudes) was administered to 320 students in one rural elementary school, grades 1-8. A random sampling, equally representing all grade levels and both sexes, of 160 children was used. Some interpretations of the interest inventory responses were that girls and boys in grades 1-8 enjoy building things, working with their hands, engaging in activities involving other people, listening to music, and drawing. A majority of the girls  and boys had career aspirations, desired to attend college, visualized themselves in a variety of careers, and had positive work attitudes. The girls in the study visualized themselves as capable of entering previously designated male-oriented careers. Girls also showed more enthusiasm about reading and writing, a more positive attitude toward arithmetic, and a greater liking for school than their male peers. The author offers recommendations based on the study that pertain to curriculum, career information, career exploration, and teaching activities. (EA)",

The materials are intended for grades K-6 and cover a broad spectrum of subject areas: social studies, mathematics, science, language arts, and home economics. Specific career education units are devoted to the world of work, self-concept, career awareness, career motivation,  and thinking skills. Most of the units are directed toward a specific grade level or for use with educable mentally retarded children.

The review of 140 selected documents applicable to the study was undertaken with emphasis on the identification of methods of assessment of the impact on human resource parameters of advances in technology. The review failed to provide a solution to the problem of quantizing human resource parameters with respect to the impact of incoming technologies. However, the use of a normative forecasting technique was strongly supported by the literature. In particular, a relevance tree approach was the technique viewed as amenable to the problem of successive  identification of increasingly finer components in an organized, structured manner. The relevance tree procedure known as a Design Option Decision Tree was identified as practical for detailing a system to a level permitting the identification and assessment of human resource components for impact quantification.

However two separate and independent techniques have been developed to measure time and identify tasks that are performed. The purpose of the study was to identify and evaluate areas in which Air Force Management Engineering Teams (MET) might benefit from occupational research data. For the study occupational research data was provided as a supplemental input to the development of MET engineered manpower standards for base level Data Automation. The analysis revealed that the techniques used by MET and  occupational analysis yield essentially the same information. Also a number of areas were identified in which occupational research data and techniques could be beneficially employed by MET. (Author/SA)",

Tables show AQE aptitude index means and standard deviations by sex and year of enlistment; percentage by sex in score range on AQE composites and at each index; number and percentage by sex for educational level and for racial subgroup; and racial composition by geographic area of enlistment. Conclusions, based on the data, were that: (1) using 1970 as a comparative base the 1973 aptitude indexes declined less sharply for females than males and two  indexes (Mechanical and Electronics) were higher for females in 1973 than in 1970; (2) the educational level of females has risen, that for males has declined; (3) racial mix is the same for males and females but recruitment of black females varies considerably among recruiting areas; and (4) younger females tend to have relatively lower aptitude scores.

A brief overview of the project is provided with recommendations for designing linkages among curriculum development agencies. The data came primarily from documentary records, evaluation reports, and teacher questionnaire responses, which provide the basis for analyses of the teacher acceptance of the curriculum units. Forty-one field tested career education curriculum units formed the focus for the research. The report examines the following diffusion-related variables: use of a temporary system as a device for linking a prime contractor with local education agencies, and teacher  acceptance of the curriculum units in the field-test sites. Several independent variables were related to the teacher acceptance of the curriculum units: (1) teacher characteristics (race, sex, education level, and years in teaching); (2) degree of curriculum unit revision; (3) unit development site location; (4) infusibility of the concepts and the units; and (5) perceived effect of teaching the unit on teacher interaction with the class and the community.

Since 1970, 348 persons have been successfully admitted in the University-based program. At reporting time, 131 (38 percent) had graduated from college; 111 (30 percent) had withdrawn. COP trainees serve elementary schools and Get Set Centers, providing small group and individualized instruction. Survey data is reviewed and tabulated, providing information about COP trainees, the kinds of services they provided, the relative changes of their roles in the classrooms, their perceptions of the program, and reactions of cooperating principals and teachers. The  cooperating principals, although agreeing that the performance and service of the trainees was excellent and the program good for training future teachers, felt that scheduling should be coordinated through the schools. The trainees felt a need for a better communication system and more counseling. It was concluded that: the program was successful in attracting participants from low-income communities; the participants played an important role in their assigned schools and day care centers; and that the participants were able to master the academic coursework required.

Selection was based on at least an eighth grade verbal and numerical achievement level, tests, and interviews. Major components of the program were: orientation to the program, on-the-job training in all skill areas, job related basic education with additional mathematics, personal and vocational counseling, and sensitivity training of RRI employees. An evaluation indicated that the primary program objective, to provide skills training and a job opportunity to someone who ordinarily would not have had this chance, had been clearly satisfied.  Success was also indicated by evaluations in the areas of personnel turnover (6 of the 10 were still employed one year after the program and 2 left to attend college on full tuition scholarships); rate of learning; job performance; and adjustment to working environment (progress in this area was extremely slow, but there were gradual improvements in absentee and lateness records and in diminution of time spent with counselors).

        "description":"The report covers the activities, results, and lessons learned in a project to test a new approach in developing greater opportunities in employment of the physically handicapped, mentally retarded, and mentally restored by harnessing the resources of leading volunteer women's organizations at the local level on a practical, planned basis. Project activities geared toward generating opportunities for handicapped men and women were undertaken in three pilot cities (Birmingham, Ala., Minneapolis, Minn., and Malden, Mass.). Their selection allowed for diversity of size, a wide range of business and industry, effective vocational rehabilitation and employment service operations, as well as an active voluntary movement that included strong women's organizations. Not all project  activities were as successful as anticipated, but major benefits were gained in terms of experience and learnings. Results of the project in the areas of handicapped surveys, promoting removal of architectural barriers, job placement, development of job seeking skills, job retention, homebound handicapped, reinstating rehabilitation dropouts, and public education are discussed at length. Numerous lessons learned in many areas as a result of experience gained during the project are described, with reference to their implications for further development, particularly where the use of volunteers would be especially valuable.

        "description":"Growth or decline in the labor force can be viewed as stemming from changes in population and labor force participation, and from their interaction. In the period 1940-70 a large increase occurred in the female labor force, particularly in the South, while a decrease was noted in the participation of nonwhites. When the sexes are considered separately within the color groups, the highest increase in labor force participation was that for white females, a lower increase was observed for nonwhite females although their employment rate remains higher than for white females. In contrast, rates have dropped for white and nonwhite males in the South, with a sharper decline for nonwhites. When the variable of age is included a steady decline is noted for older white males and for both  young and old nonwhite males, while increases in all age groups occurred for white and nonwhite females, especially among middle aged nonwhites. In summary, the proportions of persons in the various age-sex-color groups comprising the total labor force in the South indicates greater participation by white women, and a smaller increase for nonwhite women in the middle and older years and for middle aged white men.

Changes from rural to urban residence among blacks in various age groups are well documented and are associated with shifts in occupations which vary by race, sex, and age. Upward shifts in occupational levels from farming through clerical, sales, technical, professional, and managerial and administrative categories bear a relationship to the stability of these various groups. Distributional changes in occupations between 1960 and 1970 by age, sex, and race reflect to some extent an increase in the proportions of  blacks in those occupations demanding more education and training (particularly younger blacks), increasing specialization in American society, and reductions in discrimination in occupations that had been previously closed to blacks. Data suggest that an equalization of income levels and economic opportunities would make future occupational and residential mobility less necessary than at present, would increase educational opportunities in succeeding generations, and would continue to minimize the differences between the races.

        "description":"Effective response by community service agencies to clientele needs is an essential part of community development. A personnel screening instrument, a model for predicting different types of adaptation to occupational stress, is suggested as a means of increasing the responsiveness of service agencies to their local communities. Proposing the use of the model as a screening instrument stems from the realization that agency efforts to redefine staff roles to better serve community needs will produce stress for their personnel. The model has three major explanatory components: personal evaluation of the occupational role by the incumbent; the kinds of social support one receives through primary and secondary contacts, which tend to challenge or reinforce the incumbent; and the  investment of personal resources which an individual has made in the occupation. The combination of responses to all the variables in the model can be used to predict adaptation of role behavior and thus to assess an individual's capacity to cope adequately with the stress of a changing occupational role. An empirical test of the model has provided support for the validity of its constructs. (NH)",

The report focuses on Job Agents, a unique class of civil servants created by legislation in 1968. The general characteristics, attitudes, expectations and morale of Job Agents are described. Job Agents are compared to other Employment Service professions both by group characteristics and individuals served. The report describes the differing work settings in which Job Agents operated. Employment offices management styles, size and staffing of offices are analyzed in terms of impact on Job Agents' ability to provide individualized manpower services to socio-economically disadvantaged clientele. Finally, the report describes the resources available to  Job Agents and presents a statistical analysis of characteristics of clients and of services provided to clients. The report concludes that the legislative effort, to redirect the State employment service from the traditional labor exchange to a flexible client oriented system providing individualized services to California's economically disadvantaged, was generally unsuccessful.

Various personal opinions of police officials and police men and women are given to augment the findings. The study further analyzed the relationships between background and performance variables (age, delay in passing driving test, education, civil service test  scores, pre-employment interview, and height.) Several concluding observations are made about policewomen in relation to their hiring, the handling of violence, selection and supervision of officers, and perspectives on arrests and traffic citations.

        "description":"A review of the literature, covering a variety of theories as to the causes of criminal behavior in young people and barriers to their rehabilitation, lays the groundwork for a report of an experimental program using the humanities to assist in the rehabilitation of young criminal offenders, at the State Correctional Institution at Camp Hill, Pa. The prison setting had a profound influence on the evolution of the program. Comparison with other inmates showed that the program was well received by most participants for whom significant changes were recorded on several of the psychological measures used. However followup surveys showed no differences in postprison behavior between participants and other inmates. This is also true of participants in other educational programs at the  institution, raising the issues of punishment versus treatment and the role of education in a prison treatment program. The general conclusion is reached that the requirement that a prison confine inmates produces an inherently punishing environment that is antithetical to rehabilitative efforts. While it is unlikely that the humanities, or any other educational program will influence postprison behavior, such programs can serve to enrich the lives of inmates while they are in prison.

Communication was an integral part of the conference theme. The keynote address was delivered by Dr. J. Warren Perry, State University of New York--Buffalo, who focused on needs, strategies, and a discussion of the team approach. Eight groups of conference participants addressed their thinking to major discussion topics: transference of academic credits, cooperative planning  for program approval and accreditation, personnel credentialling, cooperative planning for continuing education, developing innovative programs, recognition of life experience through proficiency skill and academic equivalency tests, a health manpower information bank, and clinical affiliations. Each group made recommendations pertaining to their topic. The report also includes participant reaction questionnaire summary information and minutes of conference evaluation meetings.

Its primary purpose is to discuss the survey methodology and present some of the main characteristics of low-wage earners and of the labor market. The data source was the Master Registration Form 701 E, completed by each registrant at a Canada manpower center, which recorded personal data (age, sex, and marital status) and labor market data (occupation at last job, present employment status, type of work desired, etc.). Data are tabulated and analyzed, and findings presented. Two main personal characteristics of the work force were that a clear majority were female, and that a majority were under age 25. In terms of labor  force characteristics, more low-wage registrants were employed in clerical and related occupations than in any other. Service and sales occupations also reported significant numbers of low-wage earners. Over 70 percent of the low-wage registrants were employed in their last job for one year or less. Listings of regions encompassed and the manpower centers included in the survey are appended. (MW)",

Staff and volunteers provided counseling and referrals to applicants. Personal presentations were made to employers to inform them of benefits through the project and to open jobs. Supportive services included aid for training, transportation, child care, and job finding techniques. Activities centered on the promotion of employment based on merit and qualification rather than race or sex and relating to the target population through self-concepts, motivation, and orientation to the world of work. It was found  that: (1) jobs solved more problems than social services; (2) women are reluctant to enter male dominated employment areas; (3) women need technical skill training to compete for jobs; (4) women aided by the project lacked motivation and an adequate self-image. Recommendations for future efforts are enumerated. The 1972-73 Comprehensive Job Placement Report and applicants' profile are appended. (Author)",

The 1970-71 project activities involved participants and personnel from eight ABE centers and three home instruction units. Over 300 students, mostly rural Appalachian whites of southern Ohio, were included in the study. The major objective of the project was to collect information related to procedures and activities developed for the selection, training, and effective use of paraprofessionals who provide services for these rural ABE students and programs. The report lists a number of subobjectives related to the duties, responsibilities, qualities, and characteristics of competent  paraprofessionals. Information was gathered by observational techniques, teacher-student ratings, and logged activities. Student data was collected through interviews, personal histories, achievement test records, letters, and questionnaires.

Also discussed are the frequent handicaps imposed by older workers themselves. The second more technical study, &quot;Age and Migration Factors in the Socioeconomic Conditions of Urban Black and White Women,&quot; compares the labor force status and general well-being of older and younger women, and deals with the impact of urban size. The third study, &quot;The Emerging Pattern of Second Careers,&quot; considers a newly recognized dimension of industrial gerontology.  Increased longevity, the economy, and technological change are seen as factors aggravating the problems of older workers. Comparisons between older candidates and noncandidates for second careers and social-psychological dimensions are discussed. The final study, &quot;The Potential Role of Behavioral Science in the Solution of the 'Older Worker Problem',&quot; reexamines some major issues of policy affecting the older worker, noting that the gap between educational attainments of younger and the older workers has narrowed over the past several decades.

Among the key concepts involved are: (1) the primary goal of education is to prepare students for life; (2) knowledge, and the ability to apply it, is the schools' essential product; (3) all subject matter in the curriculum has career relevance; and (4) pointing up the career relevance of subject matter aids in motivating the student and reinforcing his understanding of the material. The volume is organized as follows: (1) the nature of career development and related research; (2) career  development practices in ongoing programs and as reported in professional journals; (3) integrating career education into five basic academic areas; (4) applying career education concepts in the fine and practical arts; (5) work, simulated work, and work observation; (6) organizing career education--a summary of views; and (7) reform initiatives and current innovations in career education.

        "description":"Conducted in Europe during the summer of 1971, the study attempts to show how three nations--Denmark, France, and West Germany--have taken steps to deal with the problems of economic growth in an advanced industrialized society by reconceptualizing the role of adult education. In the first four chapters the components of a new continuing education and training program for the United States are presented by examining the steps taken by the three nations studied. The study examines: specific programs, funding problems, legislative action, philosophy, training objectives, administrative responsibilities, and successful innovative measures. The final chapter builds on the basic building blocks offered by the three nations and suggests funding sources for a new program. Concluding  that success is based on expanding employment, as has been the pattern in the United States, legislative action in the form of a continuing education and training act is proposed and steps suggested for its implementation. The appendix offers legislative documents pertaining to the organization of continuing education programs in France and the Employment Promotion Act of the Federal Republic of Germany. (Author/MW)",

Providing historical and cultural background information about the area, its residents, and its particular health problems, the report traces the program's development, which began with the cooperative efforts of the Self Help for the Elderly organization and the Chinese Hospital in 1966. The language barrier and lack of community acceptance were major obstacles in establishing the needed health service and a training unit for the preparation of homemaker/home health aides. However, an adapted homemaker/home health aide training program was initiated with the  assistance of a three-member bilingual staff. Three case histories, chosen at random from the health service files, illustrate the type of problems encountered. An appraisal of the agency's ultimate acceptance by the community, its pattern of service, and major achievements close the report. (MW)",

Focusing on State funded corrections education programs in Oregon, data for the study were collected in 1973. Existing programs are reviewed highlighting those areas in need of change, current research applications, educational goals, and program recommendations are examined in the following areas of concern: (1) client education, (2) adult basic education, (3) vocational/paraprofessional education, (4) college education, (5) education release, (6) staff education, and (7) community education. It is concluded that solutions to society's crime problems lie in the area of &quot;societal  restructurings&quot; rather than with behavior modification of individuals in correctional institutions. The study's lengthy and detailed recommendations include modifying existing programs and developing new programs to provide for a higher quality of education for corrections staff and the community at large and improved education and training opportunities for corrections clientele.

This concept has been embodied within the Career Education Curriculum Guide and the State Career Education Model. The guide has derived, from the career education model, its four main levels: (1) introduction, for K through 5 (awareness of self and respect for the world of work); (2) exploration, for 6 through 8 (exploratory experiences are important in the process of career development); (3) investigation, for 9 through 10 (career cluster investigation is essential to the developmental process), and (4) experience, for 11 through 12 (career preparation is achieved through  successful educational and training experience). Each unit is divided by grade level, subject area, and concept cluster with an outline of appropriate learning objectives, learning experiences, and materials and resources. The second half of the document (168 pages) contains 12 appendixes suggesting activities, books and pamphlets, bulletin board ideas, career club information, commercial materials, films and filmstrips, forms, games, inexpensive sources of career information, test information, a directory of publishers, and a two-page bibliography.

Reviewing the career education movement over the last three years, the paper discusses some of the problems encountered as educators try to meet the increased national demand for more opportunities in career and vocational education, especially at the secondary level and beyond. Increased costs are seen as the principal barrier against more rapid conversion of education to a career orientation, and it is hoped that Federal subsidies will fill this growing need. The Vocational Education Act of 1968, to be reconsidered by Congress in 1975, and the Education Amendments of 1974 would be  steps in the right direction. Eight recommendations for developing a national policy on career education are presented by the National Advisory Council on Vocational Education. It is hoped that, if responded to, these recommendations dealing with funding policies and legislative needs will be the spur to action in making American education more responsive to human needs.

The final section of the paper discusses the current needs in the field of adult education. Major efforts are needed in the areas of research and dissemination of materials.

Comparison with data from the 1970 Census figures indicated that the following groups were under-represented in correspondence instruction in North Carolina: (1) those aged 10 to 19, and those aged 40 and over, (2) craftsmen, foremen and kindred workers, and persons employed as operatives, except transport, and (3)  persons with only a high school diploma or less education. Recommendations included: (1) better utilization of UNC's member institutions, (2) improved dissemination of information about correspondence instruction, (3) broader investigation of all State correspondence instruction programs, and (4) a needs assessment to determine program needs.

The survey instrument, a questionnaire, was returned by 591 LPN's in occupational health and provided data related to: personal characteristics, work and setting, administrative and professional functioning, educational characteristics, economics, and verbatim comments. The instrument, an RN-LPN profile, and a review of the data are included in the report. The results of the survey are reported, answering four basic questions that motivated the study: (1) How can LPN's supplement registered nurses (RN's) in industry? Rather than supplement the RN in industry, 75 percent of LPN's work as the only nurse. (2) What additional training in occupational  health is needed by the LPN's? Less than 30 percent of LPN's surveyed had additional continuing education in the occupational health area. (3) Can the LPN's function effectively in the delivery of health care services to workers? The LPN frequently performs RN functions in the occupational setting, without sufficient training or supervision. (4) What supervision is needed by the LPN? The data indicates a legal and professional dilemma; in 50 percent of the case studies, the LPN had no supervision. Tabulated data is appended. (MW)",

Since adult education programs are only servicing about 20 percent of the population they are not fulfilling their obligation to the community. The task for adult continuing education is not to concentrate on techniques of \"selling\" but rather to develop a comprehensive curriculum which is based on research and which meets the needs of each target group  within the community. The successful accomplishment of this primary task will facilitate the secondary function of program promotion.

Following an overview of the field and its philosophy is a collection of employer's views on why employers participate in cooperative education and how employers select cooperative students. In discussing  the school and the employer, topics considered include recruiting employers and comparison of students' and employers' needs. Some thoughts on cooperative program management, coordinator responsibilities, non-technical disciplines in cooperative education, forms, and community colleges are discussed in relation to the administration of cooperative education programs. Further areas of interest treated are: academic credit for cooperative training experiences; faculty and public relations; minority students; and Federal funding. (MW)",

Plans for 1975-76 are directed toward curriculum changes, maintaining first-year programs, implementing placement services, and evaluating community involvement. 1976-77 plans continue to build on the earlier years through curriculum adjustment, further evaluation, and maintaining desirable features of earlier programs. Twelve activities for 1974-75 are basically developmental  with a view toward the longer-term objectives. Evaluation for the 1974-75 year will be based on data collected from teachers, counselors, occupational specialists, advisory councils and others. An internal evaluation by Brevard County resource personnel will be utilized. The activities are presented in chart form according to educational level from elementary through post secondary and include placement, counseling, evaluation, and staff development.

Responsibility for both placement and follow-up studies programs rests with the county career education coordinator. (Twenty-three pages provide suggested forms to be used in the Plan. A calendar of events for the 1974-75 year is appended.) (AG)",

It is helpful for them to have access to materials which describe familiar careers and introduce new jobs and occupations. This annotated compendium is designed to meet that need by reviewing and listing printed and audiovisual materials produced in the last five years. To serve as an organizational framework for the more than 700 materials reviewed, a classification system was developed by means of which each major occupational field is linked to the United States Office of Education Career Clusters. Access to the materials is by catalog number and also by way of an index of occupational titles. The following information is included in each note: catalog  number, title, author, publication date, price, medium and time for audiovisual materials, number of pages, reading level based on the Fry Readability Formula (I-grades 1-8, II-grades 9-12, or III-grades 12 on) source, and an abstract.

An internal evaluation by the RFD staff and the University of Wisconsin Psychometric Laboratory determined, through a survey  instrument and personal interviews, that the home visit and media format were successfully received by the adult students.

The overall goal of the project was to provide, through a coordinated media system, information and motivation that would enable less educated adults to make informed choices about their life careers. WHA-TV produced 26 magazine-format, color television programs, 26 three-and-a-half minute radio programs, 13 issues of an easy-to-read newspaper, and varied promotional materials. Project 360 degrees became a national effort through a consortium of agencies representing 13 States. Additional media, such as telephone action lines, and personal contacts were  added in some States. It was recommended that more time, money, and relevant facts were needed for the television programs. A summary of reports from the consortium States, audience responses, a reprint of an article from Manpower magazine describing the project and the proposal evaluation of Project 360 Degrees are included.

        "description":"An extension of Alan Tough's original research on adult learning activities, the study surveyed large populations in rural and urban Tennessee to analyze learning patterns of adults engaged in learning projects. Data were collected from random samples of 277 adults in Knoxville and 149 dwellings in Monroe County. Tough's interview technique, an intensive probing of the adult's learning project activities occurring over a period of one year, was used to collect learning project data. Adults in Knoxville completed an average of 4.1 learning projects and Monroe County averaged 3.1 projects, which is below the number reported in related studies. Job-related projects and recreational projects were most popular with adults in both samples, while religious studies were more frequently  conducted in the Monroe sample. Three-fourths of the adults interviewed directed their own learning projects, with approximately one-half needing additional help at some point. The major obstacle faced by members of both samples in conducting learning projects was lack of time. Most expressed a desire to continue their education but few desired formal credit. Rural adults seemed to have a low level of awareness of educational opportunities. The appendixes, bound in a separate 137-page volume, contain supplementary materials. (EA)",

Careful consideration was given to: (1) the question of choice of subjects and their training; (2) demand characteristics in introspective study; (3) the status of data collection from the experience of a state of consciousness; (4) the development of a hermeneutic, i.e., a theory of interpretation devised to control the treatment of verbal reports; and (5) a system of intersubjective comparison.

Expectations may be roughly defined as a child's ideas of his own ability at a particular task. From the data it appears that childrens' expectations could be raised experimentally by a suitable adult and high expectations in one area generalize into other unrelated areas. The experiments are summarized in a number of published articles reproduced herein and listed in the bibliography. The observational data focus on children in first and second grades in a white middle-class school and in an integrated lower class school. From the time they enter school individual children are followed to see how their expectations for their own performance in  reading, arithmetic, and conduct develop. Their expectations, and their parents' expectations for them, are repeatedly measured. Children in both places have, on the average, very high expectations for themselves before they get a report card, higher than their parents. These expectations do not diminish much when marks are lower than expected; in fact for the majority, expectations are maintained over first grade. Children whose marks improve are likely to be those whose expectations exceeded marks. (Author)",

Rating scale evaluations showed no significant differences, but Ss in the failure condition chose \"frustrating\" and also other unfavorable adjectives to describe the study significantly more than those in  the other two conditions.

The sample consisted of 489 freshmen who took the SDS during orientation. The three independent variables were the test administrator's attitude toward the SDS (positive or neutral), the size of the group taking the SDS (25 or 100), and the use of monitors during the administration (monitoring or no monitoring). Over one-fourth of the subjects made scoring errors resulting in incorrect high point codes, and over one-half made errors affecting their final three-letter summary code. Less than half the subjects felt their results were useful or reasonable. Of the three independent variables, only monitoring significantly reduced self-scoring  errors, and none affected satisfaction, although trends toward interactions of the two other variables with monitoring emerged. Questions were raised about whether, even with monitoring, error rates are too high and satisfaction too low to warrant use of the SDS, in its present form, as a self-counseling device. (Author)",

The report begins with a discussion of the institutional features associated with the historical incidence of large families in the Asian agricultural setting. A description follows of the recent changes that have occurred in Asian urban centers, including: (1) the relation of the family to the economy; (2) the reorganization of housework; (3) the assimilation of women into male  roles; (4) the educational advancement of Chinese women; (5) the unevenness of change; and (6) the motivation to limit family size.

Groups were assigned to either the group (cooperative) or individual (competitive) condition. Cooperative subjects worked together on a project, and all were rewarded for their efforts. Competitive subjects worked independently and only one randomly selected \"winner\" was rewarded. The effects of \"failure\" and of \"success\" depended on a number of variables other than the amount of reward received; for example, on whether the subject saw the reward as deserved and the distribution of  rewards as fair.

A computer dating service was established in order to match subjects for a date. The independent measures utilized in these studies consisted of the Motivational Analysis Test (MAT) and the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF). In addition to completing these two tests, subjects were requested to state their preferences for an ideal data on a 10-point bipolar scale. Subjects filled out the dependent measure (The Date Evaluation Scale) immediately after the date. Results from the study indicated that a female's primary motive in the dating situation was mate selection (career, parent), but a male's primary motive was recreation  (mating drives, narcism). The author concludes that the two studies partially support the notion that attraction in the dating dyad may be due, in part, to the fulfillment of traditional role expectations. (Author/PC)",

When community psychologists concern themselves with social issues, they quite often adopt the \"oversocialized conception of man,\" which allows for no change and rests firmly on the status quo. Another \"trap\" in which the psychologist finds himself concerns the possibility of embracing a sociology that actually denies the idiosyncratic psychological depths of the people he is attempting to help. One gives up being a psychologist in favor of becoming a reactionary sociologist. The author now finds himself attempting to organize an interdisciplinary program which has as its overlapping goals the study of psychosocial issues in health  services and the implementation of psychosocial knowledge in all aspects of health care delivery systems. Community psychology can become an alternative within the psychological arena if other professionals will find ways of understanding and eliminating iatrogenesis (creation of additional problems in process of solving existing ones) in the medical and community mental health settings.

The report is based on responses to a questionnaire administered in 1973, six years after the project was initiated. Fifty-four of the original 100 members of the group completed and returned their questionnaires. Questions concerned life experiences of the year, including marital status, family life, interpersonal relationships, educational and vocational experience, leisure activities, and personal satisfactions and dissatisfactions. Most of the respondents had earned a baccalaureate degree and a few had completed some post-baccalaureate study. Two-thirds  were engaged in some educational persuits, either toward a degree or for their individual self-development. Nearly everybody was working, part-time or full-time. A majority enjoyed their work, and more than half reported that their undergraduate studies were relevant to their job. Respondents generally felt good about themselves and reported personal satisfaction with their jobs, themselves, their families and other interpersonal relationships. Personal dissatisfactions stemmed from the same general concerns of self and job, and included as well their academic pursuits. (Author/PC)",

The little money men do have when they leave comes in the form of a gratuity from the state--\"gate money,\" as it is commonly known. This report describes practices of the various states concerning \"gate money,\" prisoners earnings, savings, work release, and other factors which determine a prisoner's financial condition at the time of release.

Altruism changes as a function of an individual's overall level of cognitive-moral development. There are six forms of altruism, corresponding to Kohlberg's six sequential moral stages--moving from a belief that everyone is responsible for his own welfare to a fully universalized concern for others that transcends personal or group ties, such as was displayed by the Good Sumaritan. Research is reviewed which demonstrates a strong relationship between a person's stage of moral reasoning and his response to a victim in distress. The paper concludes, however, that altruism which serves the interest of others at  the expense of the self goes beyond the requirements of morality into the realm of love. Statements of Martin Luther King are cited in support of this thesis. (Author)",

Ss were 72 male and 72 female undergraduates, divided into groups of internals and externals based on results from Rotter's I-E scale. In a letter elimination task, several experimental situations were enacted to determine decision times. Results showed no difference between internals and externals with respect to decision times on the tasks when taking skill/chance perceptions or verifiability of feedback into account. It was also discovered that internals exhibited a trend toward accepting skill instructions and rejecting chance instructions. The author concludes that both internals and externals are more  highly motivated on a more involved type of task when they perceive their performance as being due to skill rather than to chance. The results also point out the necessity for taking into account Ss skill/change perceptions of the task employing skill/chance instructions. (Author/PC)",

Military performances of the men are subjected to longitudinal analysis to determine the relationship of scores on these inventories to various criterion performances. In this paper relationships of scores on two of these inventories--the Background Activities Inventory and the Situational Confidence Inventory--to peer ratings, attrition during flight training, and accident information are presented.

The major thrust of the workshops involved the planning of well-rounded guidance, counseling, and placement programs. Participants were using, for the first time, the South Dakota Counselor's Workbook and student needs assessment data which had been collected prior to the workshops. Input sessions consisted primarily of life/career topics. Many of the activities and procedures discussed in the input sessions were adopted by the participants as part of their local guidance program. The end result of the workshops  was the development of guidance programs based on student needs which will serve as local counselor accountability models. (Author)",

These families, while varying in detail, share structural features: an elderly moral leader, associated household heads, a shifting body of young members, and a geographical focus, often including a burial ground. Behaviorally, other features include: reciprocal economic aid, child fosterage, and care for the sick; exogamy, attendance at funerals, and often, special reputations. Adaptively, these families have aided survival in deep rural poverty, in disorganized ghettos, and in the  search for upward mobility; at times, they form multicommunity networks. Based on descent and cooperation rather than marriage and household property maximization, black extended families differ sharply from white analogues, but have many Caribbean and African correspondences. Black family norms need legal recognition and support, e.g., in rules of adoption, to reduce injurious discrimination against black people in U.S. family law and social practice. (Author)",

Most fathers had little preparation for their role and participated minimally in the day-to-day care of their new baby. Wanting to return to the pre-baby days was significantly related to the wife's complaining about the baby, going out as a couple less often after the baby than before the baby's birth, and feeling that the marriage was worse. The conclusions suggest that wives still shoulder the major responsibility for parenthood and that their reaction has considerable influence on the father's adjustment. (Author)",

In the present study, males and females divided rewards either between themselves and another person, or between two hypothetical members of a work dyad. Results showed that when dividing rewards between two other persons, females ignored members' differential inputs and rewarded each member equally. Males allocated more reward to the member with higher input. However, when subjects divided rewards between themselves and another person, both males and females with superior inputs retained the greater share of reward for themselves. Theoretical implications for understanding sex differences in equity behavior are  discussed. It was suggested that females may normally prefer equality distributions because of sex-role expectations, but are willing to violate the stereotype when a sufficient incentive is provided.

Generally, the findings indicated that prediction is difficult because there is no such person as a \"typical\" school leaver. However, it can be said that the young person who might be identified as dropout-prone is one who: (1) is reading poorly and whose reading is not improving, (2) has a relatively high rate of absenteeism, (3) is more  economically deprived than his fellow students, (4) is older than his classmates, (5) is beginning to lose interest in school, and (6) is beginning to receive poor marks.

        "description":"The Situational Attitude Scale-Simplified (SAS-S), a simplified form of the Situational Attitude Scale (SAS), was used to measure the attitudes of 132 incoming white freshmen toward blacks. The study showed that the simplified form yielded the same established pattern of results as the regular SAS. This indicates that the SAS-S would be appropriate for use with individuals who have less than a college education. White students tended to have generally negative attitudes toward blacks. However, situations that involved relatively close personal contact elicited the most strongly negative feelings toward blacks, whereas situations that involve relatively distant personal contact and service roles elicited strongly positive feelings toward blacks. Implications for future research  were discussed. (Author)",

        "description":"This paper defines a useful strategy for therapists working with adolescents which includes: (1) a general model of the group leader's responsibilities and (2) a cataloguing of some of the specific impediments for both adolescent peers and the therapist that prevent effective communication. The goal of the group therapy is to identify the specific impediments and distorted transference relationships. Unlike conventional leaders the group therapist makes no bid for power. He searches out the silent and negative members spontaneously and, at the same time, is concerned with the group as an effective growing unit. The problems encountered in this context are those of peer transference and leader countertransference as barriers to effective communication. Some transference themes  described are: attitudes toward authority and peers; acting out; silence; and somatization or the technique of handling stress by somatic symptoms. Conversely, countertransference reactions of therapists are listed: omnipotence; fear of self-disclosure; overidentification with the adolescent; or somatization and blind spots, i.e., the therapist becomes alerted to his own anxiety or depression by symptoms such as headaches, flushing, nausea, cramps. In summary, the paper presents a general model of the effective group therapist and his major responsibilities for both cognitive and positive emotional leadership. (Author/RJ)",

The special focus of the study was to provide a design model that could synthesize a wide variety of data gained from group interaction, individual personality tests, peer and therapist evaluations. The approach under consideration was to be evaluated as a potential instrument in future studies of comparative changes in psychotherapy, in studies of conditions under which the group climate is most therapeutic, in the prediction of behavior of various personalities in group interaction, and in the final analysis, as a means towards the attainment of relevant research findings from which  a more satisfying theory of group therapy would be developed. It is admitted that the present approach is simplistic and that future efforts will be made to code content, to add a needed dynamic intrapsychic measure. The integration of psychotherapeutic, psychological, and social sciences presents the possibility of developing a more meaningful framework in which some of the \"laws\" common to all grouping behavior, as well as those specific to therapy groups, can be postulated.

        "description":"The present study was designed to determine if students would improve their test performance in order to earn the right to self-evaluate their daily tasks, and then, whether they would maintain high test performance in order to keep this privilege. A second purpose was to demonstrate a practical way in which teachers could effectively reduce the amount of time they spent evaluating students' daily tasks, without adversely affecting student test performance. Subjects were students in two third-grade classrooms in an inner-city school. Classrooms made use of the Individually Prescribed Instruction Math Program designed by the Learning Research and Development Center, wherein students, to master a skill, must complete workbook pages and pass a test which measures skill performance.  The variable manipulated was the opportunity to self-evaluate workbook performance. Self-evaluation was defined as a set of behaviors which led to a decision by a child to take a test. Children were told that if they passed the first test in their present skill they would be permitted to evaluate all workbook pages for their next skill. A child who attempted a second test and failed lost his self-evaluation privilege but could re-earn it by passing the first test in the next skill. Results of the study indicate that the introduction of the contingent self-evaluation procedure produced improved academic performance for the majority of children in the two classrooms. More importantly, it was demonstrated that children could perform at a high level while sharing responsibility for managing  their own behavior. (Author/CKJ)",

The adolescent needs to develop attitudes and skills that are necessary to make him a useful member of society. There are some common areas of conflict between parent and adolescent. The youngster may steal, cheat, or use drugs. A wise parent will resist the temptation to turn the adolescent out; rather, he will work to get him on the right track again. Adolescence is described as a time of preparation for the future. If a teenager's goals seem far beyond the  parent's means, he must not be discouraged; there are opportunities for scholarships and work-study fellowships.

The program utilizes a 35mm slide picture and sound format. The program format relies on the career selection scheme suggested by Dr. John L. Holland's rationale. Preliminary validation of the system was accomplished by presenting the program to members of unique sample groups of practicing professionals. Their responses were empirically analyzed and provide predictive  validity statements. Through the use of a chi-square analysis, the concept of visual discriminations of work descriptors is possible in a survey of vocational interests utilizing a Holland typology. These results are to be reconfirmed in a similar manner in 1975, utilizing a revised edition of the survey. (Author)",

Techniques of curvilinear data analysis (orthogonal polynomials and eta, the measure of curvilinear association) are used to examine the findings of some previous studies which imply that a curvilinear or second order (or higher) polynomial function describes the relationship.

Recommendations to combat the causes and ameliorate the consequences are offered. The causes of alienation are linked to academic failure, disruption of the relations between school and the community-family support systems, and characteristics of the schools themselves which militate against participation in roles of responsibility. Alienated students are more prone to juvenile delinquency, to academic failure, to aimlessness and social disruption. Drug abuse is also linked to alienation. In order to relieve the causes and deal with the consequences, measures are proposed which are designed to spin webs of social relationships within and around the schools. Programs to  increase community support for an identification with school activities are recommended. Measures designed to reduce depersonalization within the schools are offered. Steps to be taken to integrate school and community in day-to-day patterns of interaction are suggested. All these programs are based on the principle that education must be defined in terms of the social development of the student--the nurturance of identity, of character. (Author/PC)",

Four rates of subjective orientation are considered: educational plans, self-conceptions of competence, intellectualism, and satisfaction with school. The analysis, based on questionnaire and testing data for a sample of high school seniors, identifies \"social background\" characteristics (sex, measured ability, and status origins) as important determinants of such outcomes, while school process mechanisms, including curriculum enrollment, characteristics of peer associates, and academic performance, both contribute uniquely to the explanation of subjective orientations and serve as important mediators of  background influence. Quite diverse specific patterns of dependency are obtained across outcomes. Finally, two underlying dimensions of subjective orientation are found to practically exhaust the explanatory power of predictor variables vis-a-vis the four outcomes. (Author)",

The CEPM staff identified educational personnel competencies essential to local career education programs by interviewing over 100 educational practitioners in the 18 selected local career education programs. The list of 2,025 statements obtained from the interviews and literature were combined, resulting in a list suitable for refinement and validation purposes. The final validation procedure involved a sample of 436 educational personnel (K-12). Each respondent rated each competency as to importance for an educator in his/her respective position  to possess regarding the implementation and planning of a career education program at the local level. After the final competency list was determined for each of the training models, the CEPM staff interviewed over 80 practitioners (K-12) to expand each competency into a practical context. This context was designed to suggest practical ideas, especially for educational personnel in the planning stage and preliminary implementation stage of career education. There were 12 competencies validated for all nine groups, thus creating the tenth training model or comprehensive training model. The findings, which consist of validated competencies and related performance criteria, are presented in 10 individual education personnel models and are designed to serve as guidelines for inservice and  preservice training programs.

The subjects were 120 female undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory psychology course. All subjects were presented with a booklet containing instructions on the first page followed by a passage of approximately 700 words about the Isle of Capri. The experimental conditions consisted of: relevant underlining by experimenter, relevant underlining by the subject, irrelevant underlining by experimenter, and irrelevant underlining by subject. Relevancy was defined as being those words which were the correct alternatives to the test questions. A control group received the passage on Capri with no underlining included by the experimenter, and the subject  was not permitted to underline. The results indicated that when relevant material was underlined, performance was better than when irrelevant material was underlined. The overall performance of the groups in which the experimenter did the underlining tended to be higher than the overall performance of groups in which the subject did the underlining. (WR)",

Project Alert had a two-fold purpose: to increase the diagnostic/prescriptive skills of selected classroom teachers and to increase the leadership capabilities of the selected teachers so that they might function as inservice facilitators during the following school year. Evaluation of the inservice program was accomplished through the use of teachers' self-ratings, directors' ratings, and monitors' ratings. Analysis of the pre- and post-self-ratings suggests that teacher competency increased between the start of the inservice program and its termination. (TO)",

In this paper, a number of terms relating to vision are defined and some of the limitations of specific measures of vision are discussed. In order to relate vision to reading, it is necessary to segment arbitrarily the continuous process of vision into a series of subsystems, or functions, to allow for quantitative and qualitative discussion. The more important of these subsystems or visual skills are visual acuity, fixation, accommodation, binocular fusion, convergence, stereopsis, field of vision, and form perception. Each of these basic skills is discussed individually. A brief discussion of the interrelationships is provided. (TO)",

The paper stresses that (1) peer teaching requires careful organization and planning based on detailed knowledge of the educational strengths and needs of the students; (2) peer teaching in the bilingual/bicultural classroom can provide a means of increasing cognitive functioning through reflection of cultural values; (3) peer teaching in the bilingual/bicultural language experience classroom provides a way of organizing for necessary review and reinforcement activities; and (4) classroom activities can build on the cognitive style the  student brings to the classroom.

The MWL is one of the few word lists with well-documented reliability and validity. In addition, the MWL has been shown to be highly correlated to other widely used word lists. It was hypothesized that a significant correlation existed between word recognition test results and extended reading as required in the SRI, that all functional levels could be predicted from the word recognition test results, and that functional reading estimates could be made from word recognition test results. Testing of the 146 elementary grade students indicated that a significant  relationship existed between SRI and MWL scores. Consequently, a rule of thumb was suggested for estimating reading levels from MWL scores alone. (TO)",

The conclusion based on the data was that the children's book review centers cannot be viewed as successful. The children's librarians who first requested the CBRCs showed the least benefit.

Stimuli were pictures of common objects and animals whose labels were one or two syllables in length. Following testing, the children were asked to report the memory strategy they had used. The assumption was made that children who were using a cumulative rehearsal strategy would perform better on series of one-syllable items than on series of two-syllable items. As predicted, nursery, kindergarten, and first grade subjects correctly  recalled as many two-syllable as one-syllable items. In contrast, third and fifth graders recalled significantly more one-syllable than two-syllable items. The results indicated that young children do not spontaneously use a cumulative rehearsal strategy until after first grade and that the use of rehearsal did not facilitate overall performance of the rehearsers relative to the nonrehearsers at any grade level.

The subjects were divided into two curriculum categories: those receiving objective-based instruction (designed to give instruction to children when there is a need) and those instructed in the basal reader curricula. To determine the degree of retention, mean spring-fall test scores on standardized tests of all subjects were compared. Sex of subject, intelligence, and school curriculum were also examined to determine whether these variables influenced the ability of subjects to  retain overall reading ability or reading skills. The results indicated that there were no significant differences in retention ability between males and females, between the retention scores of subjects in the objective-based program or the basal reader curricula, and between groups in ability to retain information. Significant losses were found on both measures of overall reading ability (vocabulary and comprehension) and nine of the twelve tests measuring specific reading skills. (WR)",

The subjects were 200 freshmen classified as good readers with (average or above average reading comprehension), difference poor readers (with average or above vocabulary but below average reading comprehension), and deficit poor readers (with below average reading comprehension and vocabulary). Within each group, readers were classified as either high or low subjective organizers and given either a well organized or poorly organized passage to read. After reading the passage, subjects were given a reading comprehension test composed of fact items and inference items. The major findings  was that when subjective organizational ability was combined with reading ability, additional information was provided about the performance of difference poor readers. Difference poor readers who were low subjective organizers did not perform significantly higher than did deficit poor readers who were low subjective organizers. Difference poor readers who were high subjective organizers did score significantly higher on total reading comprehension than did deficit poor readers who were high subjective organizers. (WR)",

Relationship of these choices to skilled readers, to words derived from passage analysis, and to random selections of hypothetical subjects were explored. For matches to skilled readers and to the analytical model, grade level and passage difficulty and length were significant effects. Although the youngest group showed variability of word choice comparable to a purely random selection, further analysis revealed considerable preference for selected grammatical classes in contrast to random choice. Recall protocols after one week and six months showed vocabulary usage frequency  parallel to initial key word identification frequency. (Author)",

This paper stresses the need to expand the content of the school reading curriculum to include English writing from other parts of the world, reflecting the nature and present global status of writing English. The complete reading curriculum should contain four kinds of literature: British, American, world in translation, and new world in English. In addition to studying this literature, students should also examine the varying cultures and peoples that produce it. (TO)",

However, at least 170 American colleges and universities offer popular folklore courses, 71 percent of which are part of the English department curriculum. These courses treat folklore study in several ways, as may be seen by examining a specific folklore sample from five different approaches: nostalgic, subliterary, descriptive, functional, and behavioral. Instructors wishing to disseminate applied knowledge can use the nostalgic approach, while those advocating pure knowledge may choose from the other four approaches. In any case, folklore can contribute to the understanding of  literature and may also be perceived as vital expressive culture itself. (JM)",

        "description":"This paper discusses the history and effect of popular culture generally and of the adolescent formula novel specifically. Seven primary characteristics of art as popular culture are that the work is accessible, easy to understand, conventional in form, not shocking in content, expressive of common and appropriate values, relative to some element of immediate concern, and of a distinctive, recognizable shape. The formula for adolescent novels includes the following characteristics: (1) after the protagonist is introduced, the problem is dramatized by a brief episode; (2) some event destroys the precarious equilibrium of the protagonist and precipitates a crisis; (3) the protagonist reacts with increasing frustration and does not approach the solution to the problem; (4) just as a  point of hopelessness seems to have been reached, an accident or the sudden intervention of a transcendent character brings illumination and insight to the protagonist; and (5) the problem is solved by the protagonist and appropriate action is taken. A brief synopsis and possible teaching approach are outlined for each of three adolescent formula novels: \"Watership Down,\"\"A Hero Ain't Nothing But a Sandwich,\" and \"The Chocolate War.\" (TS)",

The three objectives of a visual writing strategy are to increase stimulation and involvement in writing activities, to guide the student in inferring organizational styles of writing from planned sequences of photographs, and to promote insights into reading a variety of paragraph patterns and writing styles. The level of language sophistication and thought processing of each student would determine how much growth in composition each would evidence from all three objectives. The student would be asked to infer the meaning of a series of photographs, composed into a sequence, and to link them together in writing. Each  photograph could approximate a sentence, or a series of photographs could generate one or a number of connected sentences. Students would be stimulated to write a unified paragraph that had an intended, prearranged structure at its base. A visual to verbal literacy plan is also outlined. (TS)",

Style is the essential element of popular culture so that the kind of writing presently known as new journalism is the ultimate example of the philosophy that style is supreme. But the style of the best new journalists is not only difficult to imitate, but difficult to analyze as well. The new media and modes are taking over; we look with our eyes but see with our minds. In this way, the fusion of idea and form creates style. This means a blurring of the old Cartesian categories and disciplines--art becomes what the artist proclaims it to be. (RB)",

The analysis is based on 31 novels, or portions of novels, which treat the topic of football as a cultural metaphor at the high school, college, and professional levels. Inspecting these novels for literary images, the study finds that the football hero is represented as both the sensitive idealist and the ego-centered pragmatist. The majority of these popular heroes fall into the ego-centered category, thus debunking the myth that the football star is a hero. The use of football as a cultural metaphor allows these novels to deal seriously with the problems of contemporary life--racism, sexism, gambling,  homosexuality, and drugs--by reflecting these difficulties in the small world of the team.

The characters and plots of three stories are discussed: \"The Red House\" by A. A. Milne; \"I, The Jury\" by Mickey Spillane; and \"League of Frightened Men\" by Rex Stout. The classic detective story is defined as one in which there is a strong authorial presence and a great distance between the reader and the criminal realities of life. The hard-boiled detective story is defined as a story in which there is less authorial presence and the characters themselves are more fully developed. This paper concludes that although there are differences among detective stories, many of these differences occur largely in the author's choice of milieu and  stress in characterization. (TS)",

The history of European Indian relations has obscured many original Indian values and attitudes and has substituted a set of simplistic and unreal Anglo attitudes that translators must transcend. Unlike most Western literature, Indian literature does not instruct, but instead celebrates and invokes. In searching for the essence of a piece, the translator must choose between satisfying the requirement to preserve the literal content of the work and satisfying the requirement that the translation convey the spirit of the original. Translation of native American literature usually requires either a native sensitivity to the work or the aid of a native informant. Indian poetry is typically spare and  even the lengthy and complex Navajo chantways abound with rarified and elusive symbolism which seems to defy elegant translation. Compounding the semantic problems is the fact that most Indian literature has an intimate place in a large context of ceremony that cannot be reproduced in print at all. The inflections of song and the rhythms of drum and dance are impossible to replicate and usually lead translators to radically alter the form and even content of the Indian originals. (TS)",

Pedagogical uses of tests, on the other hand, cover all those materials and practices in observation of human behavior that are intended to help the teacher do a better job of teaching or the learner do a better job of learning, or both. The movement toward accountability affects public testing since if what legislators want students to demonstrate is reading and writing skill, then that is what the tests for public use will measure. Economic considerations dictate that tests of reading and writing skills be used to ascertain the general  effectiveness of the whole organization of public education rather than that of single schools or individual teachers. Most important in the use of pedagogical tests is that they cover all the kinds of learning teachers hope to have the students attain. To accomplish this end, teachers can choose among standardized tests, teacher-made tests, and systematic observation of pupils. A good teacher who is also informed about measurement blends teaching and testing and learning so smoothly that it is often impossible to tell where one stops and another starts. (HOD)",

Based on principles embodied in a computer simulation program previously reported (SPEL by Simon and Simon) the model proposed here has been expanded to try to account for many more kinds of student error than were possible with the original model. It explores the nature of the speller's internal representation of the word to be spelled, the information one must have in memory about the target word in order to produce a correct spelling, and the organization of the processes available to use the information to produce a spelling and to verify its accuracy. Examples of errors from children's spelling tests are used to discuss sources of errors in terms of the  model. Ways in which the model may be adapted to explain performance in other kinds of spelling tasks and some implications for instruction and curriculum design are suggested. (Author/HOD)",

The &quot;Linguistic Atlas of New England&quot; cites several examples of varying constructions which have the same meaning, e.g., 23 synonymous expressions for, &quot;He died.&quot; Another type of problematic structure unearthed by dialect geographers is that in which a single surface representation has two possible semantic interpretations, such as, &quot;He takes after his father.&quot; There are also many cases of synonymity or partial synonymity that dialect  geographers have discovered, such as the way informants distinguish &quot;stone&quot; from &quot;rock.&quot; In some instances, evidence shows informants not distinguishing words in meaning but in use as in the difference between &quot;sunset&quot; and &quot;sundown.&quot; The differing linguistic phenomena described by dialectologists will have to be considered by generative semanticists in their analysis of English.

        "author":["Mayhew, W. Laird"],
        "description":"Prospective theater teachers not only can be trained to develop self-actualization in high school students, but they must develop self-actualization in themselves. Self-actualization, as the cornerstone of humanism, emphasizes the achievable goal of being (rather than becoming) creative, spontaneous, curious, concerned about others, self-sufficient, and truthful. Since communication serves as the crux of developing self-actualization in young people, the drama/theater framework provides the logical set-up for leading adolescents toward self-actualization. Prospective theater teachers may be trained to do this through noncompetitive play and Gestalt awareness exercises. Thus, by playing at and reinventing games of their own design, prospective teachers both learn to adopt dramatic  techniques to fit classroom situations and therapeutically enrich their own lives.

There are seven areas of activity in which the behavior of governmental officials historically has been subject to possible indictment as irresponsible: falsification of information released to the public, classification of documents, attempts to manage the release of news, intimidation of the news media, interference with exercise of free speech, acts of political espionage, and communication disguised as something it is not. Each of the  seven areas of activity is discussed at length and for each a guideline is provided which is designed to aid in the recognition of irresponsible behavior by government officials. (RB)",

        "description":"Contrary to the popular theory that the proscenium type of playhouse was imported from France by the Court of Charles II in 1660, the Restoration playhouse in fact developed from Elizabethan theatres and court masques. These Elizabethan theatres were the private theatres, and were generally small, rectangular, roofed structures where aristocratic audiences watched performances by candlelight and received amenities not obtainable in the public theatres. Restoration playhouse characteristics derived from the costly masques in the courts of Kings James I and Charles I included the use of movable scenery, the raked stage, and the proscenium arch. The scenic Restoration playhouse was virtually complete in all its elements before the restoration of Charles II, but did not reach its  culmination until the building of the Dorset Garden Theatre in 1671 and the Drury Lane of 1673. As such, it endured for two centuries and became the accepted theatre model in both England and America. (JM)",

A social movement in conflict with the dominant society is labeled with easily identifiable stereotypes--bearded long hairs, bra burners, terrorists, bleeding hearts, uneducated rednecks. Traditional criticism has failed to say anything meaningful about social movements because it fails to recognize that these movements themselves are, by nature, rhetorical. It is only when the underlying purposes, goals, and intents of a movement are isolated that analysis of its rhetoric approaches reliability. The form of a movement is rhetorical because in order to exist movements must succeed in altering perceptions of the dominant society. The strength and most important dimension of a movement lies in its ability  to alter perceptual realities and to call persons to action on the basis of that alteration. In essence, revolutionary social movements force the formation of a new &quot;Gestalt,&quot; and the transactions between this movement and the old &quot;Gestalt&quot; form a counter synthesis.

Four phases constitute the mission orientation of speech as an academic field. Phase one consists of the relationship between intrapersonal communication and personal development in the first twelve years of life. Phase two encompasses social development as an emphasis of training in interpersonal communication. Phase three deals with civic development for the purpose of animating a participatory, technologically mediated  democracy. Phase four describes speech communication at the college level and its dedication to the professional development of the student.

First, debate evidence handbooks are useful because of the restrictive time element factor in summer workshops. The large number of debate resolutions and their interpretations contained in debate evidence handbooks frees the director of summer workshops from spending vast amounts of time in collecting debate evidence. Second, debate evidence handbooks supplement the library resources of host institutions during the workshop. Third, debate evidence handbooks are intrinsically useful in providing ideas for the formulation of possible case and in serving as positive precipitators of other research. The fact that a variety of material on one topic is contained in one  book often has a collective cognitive effect that generates other ideas in the minds of the workshop students. (TS)",

This shift to include such an agent(s) has been occasioned by the greater pervasiveness of the mass media in day-to-day affairs and by two processes that have accompanied this pervasiveness: (1) the status-conferral function, and (2) the accepted veracity of the news media as a result of its accountability and source identifiability. The paper also suggests that the use of these legitimizing agents is more extensive in the actual  transmission of a rumor than in the investigative or laboratory setting, and that the use of legitimizing agents may be more common in a rumor's early stages of transmission than in its later stages.

Each subject completed 25 semantic differential credibility scales for each of three arrival times: 15 minutes early, on time, and 15 minutes late. Data were analyzed with factor analysis, analyses of variance, and appropriate Scheffe tests. Results showed that: (1) the late arriver is perceived as less sociable and less competent than early or on-time arrivers; (2) the early arriver is perceived as less dynamic than the late or on-time  arrivers; and (3) the on-time arriver is perceived as most composed while the late arriver is perceived as least composed.

This definition implies three primary dimensions; argument is problematic, it is based on the perceptions and choices of people, and its rationality is grounded in a variable logic of more or less rather than a categorical logic of yes or no. Six characteristics of argument along this construct include (1) an inferential leap from existing beliefs to the adoption of a new belief or the reinforcement of an old one; (2) a perceived rationale to support that leap--an arguer must accept reasons why the claim leaped to is worthy at least of being entertained; (3) a choice among two or more competing options; (4) a regulation of uncertainty--if people have  too little uncertainty to regulate, they have no problems to solve and argument isn't necessary; (5) a willingness to risk confrontation of a claim with peers; and (6) a frame of reference shared optimally--arguers must share to an optimal degree elements of one another's world views.

Current literature on minority groups is limited almost entirely to discussion of blacks; the status of other racial minorities has been largely ignored. The role of blacks in administration has been severely limited by practices that exclude blacks from positions that involve supervision of white teachers or students. Women have been constrained by the belief that executive responsibilities conflict with the primary goal and responsibility of all women, which is to bear and raise children. Correcting the current situation will require the public schools to make an institutional commitment to the  implementation of new hiring practices. Discrimination against minorities and women in school administration will cease only when sex and race are irrelevant in hiring and promotion. (Author/JG)",

Organizational effectiveness can be defined as the extent to which a social system makes progress toward objectives based on the four phases of organizational development -- foundation, consolidation, operation, and achievement of goals. The four hypotheses tested were: 1) goal priority of the leadership will be positively associated with goal effectiveness; 2) leadership value and interest orientation will be positively, but differentially, associated with multiple goals; 3) goal priority and leadership value and interest orientations taken together will be more strongly associated with goal  effectiveness than they were when taken separately in the first two hypotheses; and 4) over time the leadership value orientation will become increasingly important in explaining goal effectiveness. Support is presented for all four hypotheses. The author concludes that of the four dimensions of organizational effectiveness, goal effectiveness is the most important. (DW)",

Two distinct approaches to the diffusion concept are identifiable. The first has been concerned with identifying the intrinsic characteristics of an innovation that influence its adoption; the second has considered factors not directly related to the innovation itself.

The conclusions reveal that competencies generally contribute to effective performance; are interrelated with behavior; exist in patterns; have affective, skill, and knowledge dimensions; and are defined in process terms. The various models generally agree on the identification of administrative tasks, the need for levels of attainment, and the similarity of competencies in various administrative positions.

Actions that might be considered legal or even desirable in one context might make an administrator liable to litigation in another context. A court's perception of the role an administrator is playing at a given moment often makes a crucial difference. A school administrator at various times plays such roles as school district employee, director of personnel, executive assistant to the school board, school business manager, and protector of students' rights. Because each of these roles is generally covered by a well-settled body of law, it is well worth an administrator's effort to study each of those roles  and its applicable legal standards. By doing so, an administrator may avoid inadvertantly depriving someone of his civil rights and may also avoid the embarassment and expense of unnecessary litigation. (JG)",

The 48 exogenous variables include pupil demographic and home characteristic measures, peer group characteristics, and teacher and school characteristics. The sample consists of over 14,000 pupils from the Equality of Educational Opportunity Survey (Coleman Report). The model is estimated by two stage least squares and ordinary least squares.

Provisions of the original Michigan statute were rather vague, and the State department of education was given considerable discretion in implementing and administering the program. Many of the rules developed by the State were quite innovative, such as an accountability provision first proposed in 1971. However, political pressures forced constant revision of the administrative rules and procedures developed by the State so that the compensatory education program underwent a gradual metamorphosis. In practice, administration of the program was negotiated between the State department of education and local school districts, and administrative  decisions invariably reflected the compromise between State and local interests. As a result, many of the department's more innovative policies, including the controversial accountability provision, were never actually put into practice. (Author/JG)",

Particularly important is the task of selecting an appropriate target group for initial introduction of the innovation. A variety of specific diffusion methods may be effective, depending on the nature of the target audience and the specific goal of the diffusion effort. Once a clearly defined goal has been selected and a desired target group for the diffusion effort has been specified, it is possible to methodically and objectively evaluate diffusion methods to identify the most effective strategy. If educational innovators proceed in this manner, their diffusion efforts are likely to yield much more positive  results than is currently the case. (Author/JG)",

        "description":"One major problem with designing a long-term evaluation strategy for administrator preparation programs is the difficulty of determining adequate measures of administrative success. The most practical approach to developing useful criteria seems to be to begin with job descriptions and analyses of actual administrative tasks. Of course, a university cannot train future administrators to handle every task that will confront them, but such an approach insures preparation for at least some of the major elements of most administrative positions. We can only build long-range evaluation into new models of administrator preparation if the models are based on careful analyses of inservice administrative behaviors with which the university is competent to deal. The content validity of the  preparation is then assured and long-range evaluation simply requires updating job analyses and comparing them with current training programs. (Author/JG)",

        "description":"This study was initiated because the author believed that the house system in the comprehensive schools of England has elements that could be adapted into many American schools to help personalize education for each student. The house system and its place in the comprehensive school is examined with reference to the general organization of the school, the need for pastoral care, and the physical requirements of a house system. Information on the operation of the house emphasizes the duties of the headmaster, head of houses, housemaster, and house tutor. In addition some aspects such as social, advising, disciplinary, and competitive functions of the house are shown. Information from many sources is used in an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the house system as they  are seen by authorities and experienced school personnel. The later sections of the document describe the design and administration of questionnaires used in surveying headmasters/mistresses and students. The final chapter sums up the data and draws some conclusions about the house system in comprehensive schools. The document contains a glossary of terms, sample questionnaires, and a bibliography.

        "description":"Policy, or program, analysis has the responsibility for providing policymakers with timely information about the consequences of alternative courses of action. In elementary and secondary education, however, the policymaking effort is complicated by the organizational gap often present between the policymaker and the practitioner or user. An educational demonstration program can help bridge this gap if analysis of the demonstration program serves as the communication link. This paper delineates an equitable way to develop cost measures, to assess achievement measures (as one outcome), and to compare alternatives using these measures. Brief examples illustrate a simple, analytically-sound way to make the most of cost and outcome data in comparing alternative programs. Because the  analysis is straightforward, the results are likely to be more credible to the policymaker. (Author)",

Such systems frequently turn out to be irrelevant to policy decisions, resisted by educational interest groups that fear unflattering comparisons and the misuse of results, and infeasible. This paper suggests several ways to analyze limited information that both improve the decisionmaking relevance of evaluation and decrease the adverse political consequences. The context for discussing these issues is a case study of an early stage in the design of a State accountability system for public schools. The paper discusses a series of theoretical and practical problems in assessing the effects of school policies  with imperfect achievement data and limited controls for nonschool factors that influence scores. Problems of the collection, analysis, and presentation of data are explored in the case study. Hypothetical regression equations and tables of policy-relevant results are provided as illustrations.

Despite intensive study, however, researchers have been unable to develop any meaningful list of leadership attributes. Empirical studies suggest that leadership is a dynamic process that varies with changes in leaders, followers, and situations. Analysis of leadership, then, should involve not only study of leaders as individuals but also of the circumstances and groups involved in a specific situation. Current literature seems to support this situational-functional approach to leadership study. Using this approach, a distinction can be made between leadership activities that contribute to the achievement of some specific group goal (the &quot;initiating structure&quot;  function) and those that maintain and strengthen the group itself (the &quot;consideration&quot; function). Initiating structure and consideration are separate and distinct dimensions of leadership, and the behavior of a leader can be described as any mix of these two functions. However, the behavior of the most effective leader usually can be described as high in both dimensions. (Author/JG)",

In a profession such as education, we should attempt to measure staff competence rather than staff effectiveness. There are three basic ways of assessing teaching: by using presage criteria (teacher characteristics), by using product criteria (pupil gain), or by using process criteria (teaching activities). Teacher characteristics can be identified (if not measured), but they do not differentiate teaching acts. Student gain can be measured, but we can't measure how much is a result of the teacher's efforts and how much is a result of variables the teacher can't control. Teaching activities can be  observed and recorded as data, and, by using a criterion-referenced assessment instrument (such as the Instrument for the Observation of Teaching Activities assessment program), these data can be related to a set of educational expectations. Assessment will not improve teaching by itself; what is done to improve the conditions revealed by the assessment is of major importance. (Author/JG)",

        "description":"Results of a 1971 New York study concerned with the role and status of teacher aides indicates that, in many instances, paraprofessionals exceed the limits of nonprofessional duties and heavily invade the professional domain. A 1971 Oregon study established that paraprofessionals were more involved in instruction than were teachers, including those without paraprofessional assistance. Even when they had paraprofessional assistance, teachers were more involved in detail and routine tasks than were paraprofessionals. The author speculates that good and poor practice in regard to the paraprofessional role may be presented in specific situation. The author concludes that the teacher's role, as classroom manager, is as overall instructional planner and controller, introductory or  redirectory agent for all learning, and supervisor of concomitant and supportive instruction. The role of the paraprofessional is always secondary to the teacher and, although \"partnership\" is present, it must be centered in supportive instruction. (Author/MLF)",

If the paraprofessional efforts, as written into job descriptions, are largely detail and subject to constant teacher supervision, either \"Educational Aide\" or \"Supervisory Aide\" would be the title designation. Should the job descriptions provide for leadership opportunities, some freedom of action, and responsibilities including involvement in instruction, counseling, and independent control of children, \"Educational Associate\" or \"Supervisory Associate\" is to be preferred.

Of the 324 New York State secondary principals contacted, 243 (75 percent) supplied information and opinion in response to questionnaires. High school principals believe that innovation is positively related to the presence of paraprofessionals. To develop new programs, paraprofessionals are needed, although the need is more pronounced in some programs than in others. In schools where principals support the need for paraprofessionals in innovation, greater numbers of new programs exist. A principal's positive attitude for the need of paraprofessionals in new programs parallel an increase in the number of paraprofessionals. A positive association exists  between the number of paraprofessionals employed in a school and the number of new programs in use. (Author/MLF)",

Frank Brown, chairman of the National Commission for the Reform of Secondary Schools, recommended that school attendance should not be compulsory beyond the eighth grade or age 14. Owen Kiernan, executive director of the National Association of Secondary School Principals, supported the present laws, which generally require school attendance through age 16. Mary Wilson, a 20-year-old ex-dropout now working as a professional pianist and apprentice carpenter, favored elimination of compulsory attendance laws but predicted that such a  change would have little real impact. LuVern Cunningham, codirector of the Detroit Education Task Force, suggested that every person should be entitled to a certain number of years of free public education to be used whenever he chooses. Joseph Featherstone, a Harvard University professor, argued that eliminating compulsory attendance laws without first creating alternative approaches or institutions to serve the needs of young people would not create any more freedom of choice than exists now.

Two dimensions of the family authority system are defined: number of rules at home and student involvement in family decisionmaking. Both few rules and high involvement have positive effects on self-reliance, but few rules has a negative effect and high involvement a positive effect on student satisfaction with school life. Interation effects between family and school authority structures failed to appear with consistency.

The emphasis of the paper is on the independent variables of structure (internal organization) and linkage (external organization) and their relationship to the dependent variable of diffusion. An eclectic theoretical approach, using major change models and social systems theory, guided the construction of a series of questions focusing on internal and external organizational factors related to diffusion. Using these questions, 33 respondents involved in IGE/MUS projects in three different States were interviewed. Analysis of the findings suggests that  intraorganizational structure and interorganizational linkage are interrelated and may be useful in explaining some of the variance in the adoption of educational innovations by different organizations.

In the long run, the language of evaluation must be shaped by the nature and intents of the audience and by the nature of what is being evaluated. It is the nature of what is being evaluated that must determine the methodologies, processes, and reporting formats of evaluation. To too many people, evaluation still means measurement. According to one authority, measurement basically involves the use of numerical values to represent attributes of objects; assessment includes measurement plus those judgemental activities that determine what and how to measure; and some aspects of evaluation are outside the realm of both measurement and assessment. The nature of what is  being examined and the purpose of the examination determine whether one is involved in measurement, assessment, or evaluation. The dissatisfaction with defining every evaluation problem as a measurement problem is plain. The recognition that the nature of the problem has an important bearing on the choice of method is encouraging. (Author/JG)",

An economical, manual MIS can be created to meet the needs of a single school. The CSE Formative Evaluation Kit operates as an MIS to provide a principal with information on a new program. Heavy emphasis is given to planning activities that relate directly to analysis of program performance and decisionmaking. The CSE kit users are directed to plan evaluation activities every time major  program components are changed. Pilot-test and field-test results suggest that the kit is useful with a variety of programs. The kit has the capability of making important planning activities a formal process. (Author)",

Actions pertinent to existing buildings and new buildings are considered separately. Regarding existing buildings, principal topics include summer cooling, winter heating, and other energy-related features such as insulation, fenestration, lighting, appliances, hot water, and human comfort. Suggested actions include those which can be accomplished voluntarily or without expense and those which require some modest effort or expense on the part of the building owner or occupant. Regarding new buildings, energy conservation actions that deal with building design and mechanical systems are described. The report concludes with a summary of mechanisms for  implementation of conservation methods and criteria for use in evaluation of them.

Data for the analysis were drawn from pupil histories of 627 students from 103 elementary schools, 553 students from 42 junior high schools, and 716 students from 5 senior high schools. Educational inputs examined included class size, school size, teacher experience, rating of teacher's college, headstart programs, school facilities, and experience and training of school principals. Factors of school climate, such as racial mixture, mixture of high- and low-achieving students, and school disruption were also considered. Findings of the study suggest that while some school resources are effective in improving  learning for all students, other inputs are beneficial mainly when targeted to a particular type of student. The study also shows that certain school inputs produce greater achievement growth than others, suggesting that a shift of resources toward the most productive inputs could generate greater achievement growth without increasing overall school expenditures.

The previous school finance plan, passed in 1969, and the problems school districts experienced under that plan are briefly described, followed by a discussion of the 1974 legislation. The new plan is a weighted-pupil formula based on the National Education Finance Project model. It provides distributional equity by defining school district &quot;need&quot; on a weighted-pupil basis, and it provides taxpayer equity by allocating State funds in inverse proportion to local revenue. The author suggests that the 1974 New Mexico plan meets the Serrano test of fiscal neutrality for operational funds but lacks a systematic provision for capital outlay and debt service.

Eight areas of concern were identified by that Commission. The &quot;most clamant&quot; was the recruitment and training of teachers. Second was the need for improvements in teachers' conditions of service. Third, the Commission sought ways of further involving laymen in the control and management of schools by restructuring administration at the district level. Maori education was the fourth area of concern. Fifth, the Commission wished to see instituted some regular system of national assessment in the basic subjects along with a system of checks at certain points in  children's progress throughout the system. Suggestions for a reorganization of the school system grew out of an examination of the sixth area of concern, while the seventh centered on obtaining a sounder legal basis for the admission of voluntary religious teachers into the schools and for daily religious observances. Finally, the Commission examined the important question of State aid to private schools. This report reviews the achievements of the last ten years. (Author/WM)",

The exploratory study was undertaken to determine the state of the art in cost-pricing of accountability components at the State and local educational levels and to enable the organizations to make recommendations about necessary, future research in this field. Four educational accountability components were identified: goal development and implementation, objective development and implementation, status surveying of student achievement, and program development. Based on these components, a survey instrument was constructed to obtain information from local school systems about the costs  involved in actually providing information to decisionmakers. The basic conclusion reached in the survey is that smaller school systems will require additional financial aid and technical assistance in establishing a comprehensive accountability program.

In two schools, the entire staff received a week or organization development consultation before attempting any structural change. In the other four schools, only a selected group of staff members received the initial consultation; they were expected to help their fellow staff members, with periodic assistance from outside consultants. Comparative data were also collected from two control schools that were trying to adopt multiunit structure but received no training or consultation. In their analysis, the authors combine a quantitative cross-site comparison with  detailed case studies of each of the six test schools. Data on staff interaction, decisionmaking, job satisfaction, and various indicators of multiunit structure were collected through direct observation during the first year of the study and through staff interviews and questionnaires administered before the initial consultation, at the end of the first year under the new program, and at the end of the second year.

The experimental laboratory studies of communication network groups have been the most rigorous attempts at understanding the effects of differential participation.

These are aspects of member participation. The present study used decision conferences incorporating either centralized or decentralized decision structures to investigate the resulting attitudinal consequences of these conferences for the members relative to their  performance, position, and participation in the group decision process.

Evidence indicates that a broader view of these problems and new opportunities for further development are emerging. Strategic management is offered as a label for these broader viewpoints. The central task of the strategic management process is the need to deal with the problems of adapting the total organization to its environment and to environmental changes. Advances will likely come from empirical research and from hypothesis testing of the constructs now developing around the concept of strategic management.

Data concerning the bases of influence in these organizations--especially data showing the importance of a person's stake in the decision--do not fit neatly into the well-known influence categories proposed by French and Raven. Disagreements among informants about who had most influence on each decision also raises questions about the general applicability of certain often-used measures of influence in organizations.

When individuals were asked to assess a hypothetical situation on the basis of various sequentially received data, a definite primacy effect was observed; individuals gave more weight to data they received first. This primacy effect, however, was vitiated by group interaction. The study also showed that after group discussion and consensus, individual opinions were closer to the group assessment than to the individual's original assessment. A tendency toward convergence within groups was also observed, although it was not statistically significant. Responses of the subjects were compared to the Bayesian norm and to utility and trustworthy data. A number of  statistical tables and graphs summarize the findings of the study. (Author/JG)",

Although Ss with identified auditory strengths had greater observed mean scores in listening  comprehension of rate-altered instruction than Ss with visual strengths, differences were not statistically significant.

In developing and evaluating the guidelines, the Tennessee School Planning Laboratory analyzed plans of other states for identifying handicapped students and for providing them with usable facilities, reviewed pertinent literature, and sought advice from experts on the special needs of the physically impaired. The ethical and legal rationale for including disabled students in regular schools is discussed by conference speakers, and general suggestions are offered in connection with vocational education and with options for conversion of  available buildings to maximize accessibility. Presented are guidelines for the construction of new facilities in regard to exterior site preparation, such as the provision of easily accessible building entrances and elevators, nonslip ramp surfaces equipped with handrails, walks and curbs that facilitate unhindered movement, and special parking facilities located near buildings. Considered among guidelines for building interiors are recommendations concerning corridor width, stairway design, elevators, drinking fountains and restrooms, and special areas such as cafeterias, gymnasiums, swimming pools, and libraries.

Forty-six teachers and school administrators experienced in working with minority populations were recruited as TTT Fellows. Described is the TTT training program consisting of three components: theoretical courses dealing with such topics as psychology and education of talented, creative students and sociocultural dynamics of minority groups; internships and practicum experiences in settings such as urban schools and community action agencies; and integrative experiences, including seminars on inner city problems, discussions with resource personnel, and  visits to programs for high-potential disadvantaged students. Reported are evaluation procedures and findings such as that TTT Fellows developed sensitivity to the needs of gifted disadvantaged students and that many felt that the field experience was the most valuable program component. Examples of the current impact of TTT Fellows as change agents include their attainment of leadership positions as teacher trainers and administrators, and their publication of over 50 articles on topics such as program planning and curricular materials. Dissertation titles are listed, and an appendix describes curricular packages developed by TTT Fellows. (LH)",

Twenty-six tables provide statistics on topics such as: number of special education pupils being served by Pennsylvania schools, number of special education teachers, prevalency rates by handicapping condition, average number of pupils per teacher by special education categories, hiring demand for special education teachers, age range of special education teachers by category, special education teacher supply from Pennsylvania teacher preparing institutions, teacher withdrawal rates, and projected hiring demand  for special education teachers by category to 1983. Among findings of the study given are that: (1) Pennsylvania currently produces about twice as many special education teachers annually as the public schools can hire with the surplus expected to increase until 1980; (2) about 2,000 teachers are working in special education assignments without full certification (particularly in the gifted area); and (3) the proportion of women in special education is greater than in regular teaching.

Ss were divided into two groups according to their high or low degree of visual function difficulties and were then randomly assigned to treatment groups utilizing Sullivan programed material augmented by tutoring and behavior modification, Sullivan material as directed in the teacher's guide, and Ginn basal reading materials augmented by a language experience approach. Results indicated that neither the instructional method nor the vision variable exerted significant influence on Ss' reading achievement during the 8-week period,  although mean improvements tended to be higher for programed materials than for the language experience approach to reading.

Failings of a previously used remedial-resource approach (which resulted in a high dropout rate) are recounted. Discussed briefly are the remedial-prevocational portions of the curriculum including students' participation in a programed instructional series geared to improve language and intellectual capacities and a program of vocational guidance and career exploration experiences. The major portion of the document explains creative-leisure arts activities and five two-week  personal experience modules titled \"You and Your Feelings\", \"You and Your Future Family\", \"A Personalized You\", \"You and the Drug Culture\", and \"You and Others.\" Aspects of the modules described include role playing emotional situations, multimedia presentations concerning human sexuality, and student visits to hospitalized persons. Successful results of the program such as decreases in aggressive behavior, increased school participation, and improved scores on a Person-Group Relationship Scale (which is appended) are noted. Also appended is a list of creative and leisure arts program components. (LS)",

        "description":"Evaluated in a 3-year project were the effects of three different classroom settings (a graded open classroom with a resource teacher, a multigrade open classroom emphasizing individualized instruction, and two self-contained special education classrooms) on achievement, self-concept, and classroom behavior of 30-38 educable mentally retarded children 8- to 13-years-old. Analysis of pre- and posttest measures of self-concept, achievement, attitudes, and classroom behavior did not demonstrate that one setting was clearly superior to another in producing meaningful gains in academics, self-concept, or attitudes toward schooling. Open classrooms promoted more peer interaction while the self-contained setting elicited more attending and teacher directed behavior. Teachers perceived  Ss in open settings less favorably than Ss in self-contained classrooms. Associated with academic success were the learning characteristics of attention and independence. Task-oriented peer interaction, sociodrama, role playing techniques, and the use of media programs to assist instruction in alternative settings were found to be positive program components. Seven appendixes provide such information as a listing of topics covered during the sociodrama sessions and a list of media productions. (CL)",

An overview discusses the purposes and dimensions of parent training (social and emotional support, exchange of information, opportunities for parent participation, and improvement of parent child interactions). The university-affiliated program at the University of Washington, an example of a center-based parent training model, offers short-term, individualized parent training emphasizing home carryover of data keeping and behavior modification programs. Reviewed are three variations of the  home-center parent training model: the carryover by parents of school instruction to the home, the teaching of new skills in the home, and the training of parents as volunteers in the center. Examples of parent lessons and child progress are included. Parent participation in a home-based program is exemplified in the Portage Project model which uses weekly prescriptions guaranteeing success for the parent and child. Finally, the parent implemented preschool model as seen in the Regional Intervention Program in Nashville, Tennessee is described in terms of the individual tutoring, generalization, and classroom training modules.

Literature which supports the mainstreaming of moderately handicapped children is reviewed briefly. Application of the behavioral model of education on the community level is considered in terms of the basic skills which comprise essential education and the accountability of professional educators. Handicapped children are viewed as those eligible for special services involving changes in the teaching/learning environment. Five assumptions (such as the accountability of the school and community for the child's acquisition of skills) which undergird the concept of minimum objectives are explained. Suggestions are given for developing systems of minimum objectives  for student progress within a school year and over a period of years. Use of intervention to accelerate rate of mastering minimum objectives is described, and its application with a 12-year-old girl deficient in math skills is explored. Pointed out is the usefulness of minimum objectives systems in determining eligibility for special education services, in evaluating the effectiveness of those services, and in determining when a child no longer requires special services. Attention is also given to the benefits of a minimum objectives system for gifted students and to the challenge of developing objectives for social behaviors. (LS)",

Focused on in the second example is a vocational teacher's use of self-paced instructional units to teach math skills necessary for completion of course projects to students who would otherwise have been denied entry into the class. The third example recounts a team effort (including four teachers, a  guidance counselor, and other personnel) to develop an individualized program for a 12-year-old boy with problems such as poor school attendance and disruptive behavior. Results of application of time out contingency for disruptive behavior, and free-time reinforcement for completed assignments are reported to include positive changes in the boy's attitude toward school, and improvement of reading skills by two grade levels in 65 days.

        "description":"Administrators of 166 California school districts were questioned regarding transition programs (mandated by legislative and court actions) for students previously classified as educable mentally retarded (EMR). Detailed program descriptions were obtained from the 10 administrators interviewed, while information from 156 districts was obtained through a mailed questionnaire. Sample districts included high Anglo, high black, and high Spanish surname districts as well as districts ranging from small to large and representing all parts of the state including both rural and urban schools. Findings indicated that all districts had implemented systematic procedures to review EMR pupils though specifics varied widely, and that ethnic characteristics of reclassified pupils reflected the  ethnic characteristics of the district. The most popular transition model was regular class placement with tutorial help from paraprofessional aides. Inservice training for staff serving transition pupils was conducted by approximately half the districts. Most programs were supported by state funds with some districts matching with local funds. Administrators agreed that previous inequities of placement were being corrected, though there was less confidence that transition programing was consistently beneficial to transition or regular class pupils. Recommendations included the development of comprehensive systems for program evaluation. Appended are texts of relevant legislation and Department of Education directives, the interview schedule and questionnaire, and a listing of  participating districts. (DB)",

Briefly explained are criteria  for assessing developmental level and the use of scoring sheets (attached). Provided with many of the behavioral items are examples and a space for teacher comments. Subscales are provided for the following abilities: postural control, locomotion, fine motor, and visual-motor (in the area of motor development); visual development, auditory development, and tactile development (in the area of perceptual abilities); undressing and dressing, personal hygiene, feeding skills, and toileting (in the area of daily living skills); receptive language, expressive language, and speech (in the area of language development); and socialization and development of self-concept (in the area of socialization).

It is explained that the scale is structured according to normal development and evolved out of the original Azusa scale with which it shares the following subscales: socialization, daily living skills, motor development, perceptual abilities, and language development. Results of a field test of the scale's pilot version with 70 teachers indicated that the scale was most effective when used to assess developmental level and measure developmental progress  in low functioning deaf-blind and multihandicapped children.

These reports fulfill the first objective, knowledge building, of a program that will culminate in the application of the knowledge about NFE in developing areas of the world through consultation, technical assistance, workshops, and information dissemination. Cross-disciplinary team working papers and semiweekly debates are the basis for delineating the future role of NFE in development planning as described in this series. This team report integrates the following generalizations that emerge in the individual studies. The concept of NFE is dependent on context and defined by the form of sponsorship and pedagogical format used. For national development, the impact of the concept of nonformal  education is the expansion of educational alternatives and a sharpened comprehension of the world of out-of-school learning. In practice NFE is a response to a demand originating with the learners, such as a need for occupational education or education designed for rural settings. Planning for NFE, within a concrete situation and specific demands, facilitates a systematic look at formal education and the development of more equitable formats for financing. (JH)",

Part 1 deals with the national allocation of resources to the educational processes. Gathering reliable empirical data on cost-benefit and/or rates of return for allocation decisions is a critical problem. Despite this problem the questions asked when deciding resource allocation, such as why invest in one activity rather than some other, must still be answered. Part 1 also looks closely at the shortcomings of cost analysis in nonformal education in which cost figures are often used to prove that nonformal education is less expensive than formal education. Suggestions are made for improving such cost comparison studies. A common format for collecting  cost data is proposed for testing. Part 2 begins with a state-of-the-art review of the economics of nonformal education. The underlying hypothesis of this review is that nonformal education can substitute for and/or complement formal education in both more and less developed countries. The way that nonformal education complements formal, the problems involved in investment criteria applied to nonformal education, and implications for planning the hypothesis are discussed. (JH)",

Chapter 6 examines  accomplishments of international assistance; identifies trends with respect to the purpose, channels of interaction, and specific programs; identifies shortcomings; and makes suggestions for overcoming limitations. Chapter 7 focuses on the reciprocity of international interaction in nonformal education. Chapter 8 assesses the assumptions underlying past strategies in international interaction and suggests more appropriate strategic approaches for the future. The concluding chapter sums up the strategies of international interaction in nonformal education and offers 69 hypotheses as useful guides to action and as aids to thinking. (DE)",

        "description":"Within the context of the total educational system of Ethiopia nonformal educational activities are described. These activities, undertaken by several government ministries and quasi-governmental and private organizations, are being conducted for the purpose of maintaining governmental services, improving living standards, and providing the educational/communication method for achieving developmental goals in agriculture and rural life. Conducted essentially for out-of-school youth and adults these varied activities have no coordinated policy or direction. These nonformal programs are, however, looked to as a major means for reaching developmental goals of critical importance to the Empire. The first chapter of this report provides observations on nonformal education derived from  the country study, or sector review, and presents major generalizations that would be of use in securing the participation of rural masses, rural workers, policy makers, and others in the development of a nonformal educational program. Chapter 2 describes the history of the Ethiopian Education Sector Review, which is the basis for the report. Chapters 3-6 describe ongoing or proposed forms of nonformal education in Ethiopia, including the modern sector and vocational schools, the rural sector, and literacy programs. Appendixes contain case studies of various programs and reports related to the sector review. This report is one in the series described in SO 008 058. (JH)",

Chapter 2 summarizes recent efforts to expand and reconstruct the concept of development. Chapter 3 examines the theoretical basis for historical patterns in educational history. Chapter 4 analyzes the impact of cultural evolution on educational formalization and includes the impact of elites, ideological uniformity, symbolization of behavior, and management of surplus energy. Chapter 5 discusses the relationship between ways in which  people are accustomed to learn and the ways in which teaching is conducted. The sixth chapter examines the work of Paul Goodman and the impact of civic and occupational life on educational arrangements. Chapter 7 analyzes the work of Marshall McLuhan and how patterns of perception form cognition and how cognitive styles determine cultural character. Chapter 8 reviews Ivan Illich's concept of \"deschooling\" or returning educational activities to their functional roots. The ninth chapter examines Paulo Friere's idea of using nonformal education to raise consciousness and free the oppressed.

Nonformal education, as defined for this application, is intentional and systematic, but unlike formal education, subordinates form to mission. Eight \"families\" of case studies represent a sample from a larger number of possibilities categorized according to the project's mission and its sponsorship. The eight categories include projects for agricultural development, family planning, literacy, health and sanitation, and projects sponsored by colleges, universities, voluntary associations, armed forces, and industry--all taking place in both  developed and developing nations. Chapter 1 provides the rationale and methodology used by the study team. Chapter 2 consists of a short listing of cases surveyed, along with abstracts. All of the cases are described more extensively in chapters 3-10. The final chapter synthesizes the families of case studies and makes generalizations that will provide practical lessons for the future of NFE. Appendixes carry supplementary reports. (JH)",

        "description":"A second-year biology class at Sedro-Woolley High School is part of an interdisciplinary program designed to develop a heightened awareness of environmental problems. A model for such a course is explained and evaluated. Students' awareness of values increases through the use of problem-solving techniques, audiovisual aids, articles and books, and school-community projects in pursuing environmental concerns. These learned values rest on sociological, psychological, emotional, spiritual, and philosophical bases that interrelate with the values of scientific and technological developments. Through this, the student becomes aware that an environmental situation is the result of the relationship of man to his world. In evaluating results of the study, two thoughts come to mind for  the teacher involved in an integrated academic program: (1) in keeping with the idea that all education is environmental education, one would conclude that ideas relative to environmental concerns should be interwoven into the total fabric of the educational process; and (2) a real challenge is presented to the teacher in preparing students to recognize our society's cultural attitudes and value systems and to provide a chance for the student to become adept at evaluating these attitudes and values, his own as well as those of society, and at developing his own perceptions.

Through the use of team-teaching, group activities, field trips, and community projects, students gain an awareness of important environmental concepts and become aware of their social environment. One problem encountered in this project is the advanced reading level of most of the materials on environmental education. However, many of the articles suitable for  class use can be reworded in order for students to comprehend them.

        "description":"Social scientists seeking relevance in their disciplines should search for the touchstone of this relevance in the cultural order instead of in their social science disciplines. Culture preserves the distilled wisdon of the past but it also encapsulates much that is harmful, and even fatal, to human existence. Such basic questions of culture such as who eats what, what do we do with waste products, who dominates whom, who marries whom, who invents what, who rationalizes what, and who teaches what to whom must be asked to get at what is relevant. A cross-cultural perspective can give us these vitally needed perspectives on current problems of social crisis and pollution. The implications of American passion for eating beef, our inhibitions toward intelligent policies for recycling  waste, the reality of dominance in social relationships, the decline in the family as a social institution, and the power of ideas to influence peoples' life styles have world-wide future significance. Yet the history of human development exhibits constant pressure toward ever larger groups, more complex modes of dominance, exploitation, technology, and rationalizations. A civilization cannot both grow and remain the same; therefore, humanity must learn to live under the curse of culture rather than die under it. Relevance comes in the attempt to modify this culture to avoid pitfalls and find positive solutions. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"In examining the role of values in the curriculum, the author raises four problems: (1) Can one justify trying to change student values at all? (2) Can one justify one particular set of values? (3) Can one demonstrate the occurrence of change in student values due to the educational factor? and (4) Can one measure student values? The goal, in value matters, is the discovery of the solution to problems of selection and rejection that require professional expertise and demonstration of the validity of these solutions. If a value is held and if it cannot be shown to be a derived value based on faulty reasoning or false premises or conflicting with other sound values, then acting to promote this value is justified. In teaching values a teacher should teach as facts only those  assertions which can be objectively established. Further, one should teach the development of skills with which students may arrive at and test conclusions, the idea that certain established conclusions can be reassessed in the light of new evidence and later be proved wrong, and the development of both cognitive and affective dimensions. In measuring the change in student values much research is needed to develop an adequate instrument. The author still considers the Hartshorne and May instrument, published in 1928, as the best for determining and measuring values. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"Core ideas in the discipline of social psychology are examined in this publication. Social psychology is the study of social behavior based upon individual psychological attributes or personality. An individual's personality can be thought of as inner states of readiness which predispose a person to respond in certain ways in social situations. A person's psychological attributes, which can be either fluctuating or stable, are made up of moods, beliefs, attitudes, values, motives, and skills. These attributes make up the essential features of an individual's self-concept. Personality develops through a process of individuation and socialization which includes the influence of physical characteristics, relationships with the family, school, peer groups, work groups, and the mass  media. The major mechanisms through which such social learning operates can be categorized as compliance learning, learning by identification, complementary role learning, and internationalization. An individual's social behavior then depends on how his personality interacts with the social situation. Subjective experiences, such as perceptions, thoughts, and feelings, also lead to and accompany social behavior. Once a person reacts in a social situation he changes and the social situation which produced his action changes. (DE)",

        "description":"Numerous criticisms of college social studies methods courses have generated various reform efforts. Three of these reforms are examined, including competency-based teacher education, the value analysis approach to teacher education, and the human relations approach to teacher education. Competency-based courses develop among future teachers precisely stated teaching skills, defined as observable, measureable performances that bring about student learning. They tend to underplay the development of personal charisma or of particular fundamental personality characteristics. The value analysis approach stresses the identification of issues and the appraisal of responses to pertinent central questions such as (1) What should be the goals of social studies instruction? (2) What  knowledge is of most worth? (3) How should lessons be organized and presented? and (4) What teaching strategies are of most worth? The human relations approach stresses personality development through the mastery of human relations techniques. Advocates of this approach believe that good teaching depends primarily upon good human relationships. Promising new techniques of instruction for implementing one or more of these approaches include (1) self-instructional learning packages; (2) protocol materials; (3) simulation; (4) prototype lessons; (5) curriculum materials analysis systems; (6) classroom interaction analysis systems; and (7) microteaching.

        "description":"System analysis offers the teacher a significant organizational device for studying society and social problems in the classroom. System analysis can be used directly to describe and understand the relationships and interactions between individuals, bridging the distance between learning conceptually and learning directly from personal experience. Another pedagogical advantage of the system approach is that it can be taught in its own right as subject matter, or it can be used as a vehicle for producing greater understanding of matter taught in history, sociology, etc. The fundamental characteristics of a system, representing the interaction of two or more parts, are goal- or non-goal-orientation; mechanical, social, and natural types; the functions of detecting, selecting, and  effecting; intrasystems; intersystems; communication and transaction capabilities; and change and equilibrium. These characteristics, diagrammed and applied to the concepts of family and poverty and to ecological problems illustrate use of the method. Numerous examples of elementary level classroom activities exploring the characteristics of system ideas and relating system concepts directly to student's daily lives are also included in this document.

This report, the result of that conference, offers a conceptual base of intercultural study by examining the nature of world society from the viewpoints of an economist, a geographer, a political scientist, and an anthropologist. Intercultural education is defined and seven goals for intercultural education are suggested. Focusing on programs already incorporating an intercultural dimension, the report describes the major existing  international/intercultural education models and analyzes them with the Curriculum Materials Analysis System (CMAS--produced by the SSEC). A model for intercultural education is suggested based on the definition and the seven goals developed for intercultural education. The last section lists areas of research that need further exploration and offers a model for evaluation of intercultural programs. (Author/JR)",

        "description":"In the sixties the crisis of the credibility and competence of schools resulted in the funding of programs to remedy school problems. The model for curriculum reform came from the university and, more particularly, from liberal arts departments having the capacity to improve curriculum content and teacher expertise. In a few instances attempts were made to require a marriage between the disciplinary specialists and personnel in the schools of education. Some of the effects of the reforms based on the university model included an emphasis on the disciplines and a lack of continued involvement in the school on the part of the specialists. Also, many teachers who were \"turned on\" by the new curricula and stimulating institutes were frustrated in the classroom because of inadequate  financial and administrative support. The new programs, for the most part, also failed to provide for individuality. The colleges, too, failed to change their own content in response to the new curricula. Change in the university model has now been effected because of student demands. This progress in democratization should improve the university and its influence on the schools. (JH)",

        "description":"The systems analysis of political life might be used as a basis for teaching about the political process in all grades, including elementary school. A political system is part of an intra-societal environment including ecological, biological, personality, economic, cultural, and other systems, all operating in society and bound by an extra-societal environment which is the sphere of relations among national societies. This system, emphasizing the relationship of the political system to its environment, is regulated by \"demands,\" one of the two major inputs from the environment; \"outputs,\" the decisions made by the authorities; \"support\" for the system, and other major input; and \"feedback,\" a concept which unifies the whole analysis. The three basic components of the system  unified by the feedback process are the political community, the regime, and the authorities. The concept of politics as a feedback system focuses on the cycle of inputs and outputs and presents the political system as a conversion process that regulates itself in order to persist. This cycle is the political function of allocating authoritatively the valued things of society, which is an order-maintaining role. This theory of the political system deals with fundamental processes and relationships rather than isolated facts. (JH)",

        "description":"The major concepts, structure, and methods of anthropology are presented for persons concerned with teaching or constructing new curriculum approaches. Man is a mammalian, social, and cultural animal, who has needs that are satisfied through social relationships. Because these relationships are repetitive, they form a structure. This social structure generates its own needs and operates in the medium of a cultural tradition which must be learned by each human being. In the process humans acquire a personality, become members of many social groups, and practitioners of one or more traditions. However, no tradition fullfills all of man's needs, because the very fact of fulfilling needs creates new needs. Therefore, at a faster or slower pace, every tradition is changing. This  process of change takes the form of innovation and borrowing, the latter sometimes called \"diffusion\" of culture traits and ideas. Changes in a tradition have two simultaneous effects of complication and simplification. Complication proceeds only so far before the chaotic quality of the complexity demands some sort of overriding generalizations of simplifying discoveries. Some of these simplifying features affect the way in which human beings interact such that doing without them becomes unthinkable. For example, man will never do without the use of fire, money, or agriculture. These simplifying discoveries affect the basic nature of man and, by adding to the total score of man's traditions, affect the cultural aspects of the human being. (Author/DE)",

Most economic studies currently being &quot;learned&quot; are wrong, however, and must be changed. A strong case for the teaching of basic analytical skills rather than a particular body of subject matter is presented. These skills enable students to study other special problems or concerns as well as economics. The study of economics can aid decision-making and analytical skills in real-world policy problems. Teacher training programs and summer institutes for inservice teachers were conducted to implement a new economics curriculum. The Pittsburgh Developmental Economics Education Project (DEEP) is analyzed and is  offered as a model for the successful implementation of economics into existing curriculum. (Author/JR)",

The school needs to become a multi-ethnic institution which accepts, encourages, and perpetuates values endemic to diverse ethnic communities. However, focus on ethnic and cultural variables must not divert attention from the role of individual and institutional racism in American society. Effective educational policy and programs must be based on research and theory which focus on both race and cultures and the complex interactions between these two major variables as well as related variables, such as  socioeconomic status, ethnicity, values, language, and behavioral patterns. Because of the immense complexity of the problem, there is a need to examine multiple variables in determining causes and to devise effective change programs related to race and education. Further research and analyses need to better clarify the relationship between cultures and race in explaining interracial problems and conflict. Concepts related to race and ethnicity can best guide the research and programmatic efforts in this field. (Author/JR)",

A differentiated and flexible teacher education program would take into account local, state, and regional teacher needs, which would necessitate the establishment of regional communications networks between the teacher training institutions and local school districts. A guided program of educational experiences with all types of children on all grade levels and with student interaction with inservice teachers, administrators, and members of the community would serve as a basis for area specialization or withdrawal from the program and would give the student a perspective on  the reality of children, teachers, and schools. If the student elects to continue, the last two years of his or her undergraduate program may be spent at a consortium institution of specialization. Area consortia composed of institutions that specialize in one or two areas would provide a differentiated pattern of teacher education that would allow consortium members to concentrate on excellence. Finally, this program would necessitate redefining the role of teacher trainer, changing it from one of a supplier of student teachers to one of an active participant in staff development. (PD)",

To implement the needed reform, the regents sanctioned 12 pilot programs in 1971. These projects are expected to mature and serve as resources for the development of a more complete reform of teacher preparation and practice. Accreditation of teacher preparation programs will be a two-step process--initial approval and registration. Initial approval will be based on the design of the program  demonstrable teaching competencies. Registration will be based on the ability of the program to give evidence that graduates can demonstrate competencies necessary for effective teaching. Certification procedures will be reformed to expand the opportunities for meeting permanent certification requirements, to base issuance on the demonstration of competency, and to include periodic testing of competency for the maintenance of certification. It is expected that by 1980 facilities and programs for the continuing education of school personnel will be available throughout the state.

Each study represents an attempt to apply direct observational techniques to the investigation of the instructional-learning processes and to use the observational data for evaluating and documenting a wide range of learning outcomes. The first two papers, each examining a different technique, focus on how observational techniques are used as an evaluative instrument to study classroom behaviors across diffuse geographical locations and/or across different educational programs. In the three succeeding papers, the authors  report studies designed to focus on certain instructional-learning behaviors for a particular purpose other than for the evaluation of classroom behavior in a summative sense. The last section contains two discussions that offer critical comments on the studies reported and suggest implications for further research.

        "description":"This paper discusses an approach to competency-based teacher education whose goal is the development of early childhood education teachers who have the requisite knowledge, attitudes, and skills for facilitating children's cognitive, affective, and psychomotor development and who are well-informed, creative, flexible, open to experience, responsible for themselves and others, and guided by positive goals. Toward this goal, 15 competencies are proposed. To provide students with opportunities for the development of these competencies, the following areas of study are recommended: (a) self-understanding for teachers, (b) child development, (c) the young child in his environment, (d) language arts, (e) literature for young children, (f) reading skills in early childhood education,  (g) the expressive arts in early childhood education, and (h) teacher/parent relationship. In conclusion, the author states that humanism is crucial to teacher effectiveness and that a good competency-based program must offer each student opportunities to become a whole person. (PD)",

        "description":"The smoking behavior and attitudes of public school teachers were studied to determine if the teachers' smoking behavior is related to their attitudes and behavior regarding students' smoking practice and smoking education in schools. The school system studied was in Northampton, Massachusetts, where 162 of the 194 teachers randomly selected from various schools in the district completed the close-ended questionnaires, administered and collected by the researcher. The study yielded a return rate of 83 percent. The results of the study showed that the general climate in school favored the establishment of a comprehensive smoking education program. It also indicated that the teachers' attitudes and behaviors towards smoking education were closely related to their smoking behavior.  The exsmokers were the most active group in attempting to initiate change in student smoking behavior, while the smokers were the least active in this respect. Furthermore, preservice and inservice teacher training programs in relation to smoking education were shown to have been extremely sparse and ineffective in the past. Teachers felt that they were ill equipped to deal with student smoking behavior and suggested that a health education specialist deal with this important health education issue at the classroom level.

        "description":"A qualitative evaluation of teacher training in Sweden has been in progress since 1969, covering all trainees admitted to schools of education that year and all directors active in teacher training. Questionnaires were distributed to all students on entry, after three semesters, after completion of the field-experience component, and at exit. The first questionnaire gathered demographic information, and the remaining three sought evaluative information. Data about resources of the school, matters connected with planning, recruitment, collaboration and influence, and information dissemination were gathered from directors of teacher training via questionnaire and interview. In general, students felt that: (a) training involved too large a proportion of time on subject studies, the  right amount of time on pedagogics, and too little time on methods and practice; (b) they exert too little influence on the program; (c) the program did not provide enough individualization; (d) they did not experience their studies as an integral unit; and (e) the field practicum was the most valuable component of training. Directors noted that there are great organizational difficulties involved in collaboration, that schools of education lack the openness to change required by the curriculum, and that trainees have insufficient experience of environments outside the school. They also expressed apprehension about the increasingly centralized direction of schools of education. (HMD)",

Three basic research methods were used--content analysis, content validation, and field testing. Variables comprising the resultant model were translated into the Parity Profile questionnaire, a 146-item instrument designed to yield a descriptive profile of parity among those collaborating to design, conduct, and evaluate a teacher education program. Basic findings showed that: (a) the Parity Profile questionnaire does yield  consortia policy-board descriptions of parity based on the 23 variables of the conceptual definition; (b) the questionnaire reveals widely different descriptions of parity among some consortia and more similar parity profiles among others; (c) subgroups reveal very different descriptions of parity within some consortia; (d) some subgroups reveal fairly similar parity profiles in other consortia; (e) no consistent patterns are apparent of one subgroup consistently yielding higher or lower profiles than those of another subgroup or the whole group.

It was hypothesized that participants in a preservice program would be judged more favorably in terms of general performance than would past students who had not had such an experience. Classroom supervisors of these individuals were asked to evaluate them in comparison to other student teachers from Western Illinois University that they had supervised. Fifteen supervisors were mailed questionnaires, which made no mention of the student's preservice experience, and were asked to rate the student teacher \"weaker than,\"\"same as,\" of \"better than\" previous student teachers. Results indicated that preservice programs  favorably affected performance in student teaching. Some positive characteristics of the students with preservice training included a greater speed of adjustment to the classroom routine and stronger classroom management and leadership skills. In conclusion, student teachers who had participated in a preservice program were judged significantly better than past student teachers on 7 out of 17 items, which supports the intuition that a preservice program can lead to a better-equipped graduate.

        "description":"This speech outlines the role of the teacher supervisor in public schools. After a review of the negative aspects faced by many student teachers, recommendations are made for a better working and learning relationship between the teacher supervisor and the student teacher. The integrated program at Lenoir Rhyne College includes the following college orientation for a supervising teacher: (a) reading the Supervising Teacher's Handbook, (b) briefing at a dinner meeting, (c) examining the student teacher's Guide to Secondary Student Teaching, (d) conferring daily with the student teacher, (e) periodically conferring with the college supervisor, and (f) learning from the experienced or certified supervising teachers in the school. Ways in which the supervisor can help the student  teacher include: (a) observing--help the student teacher decide what objectively to look for and explain why certain things happen; (b) participating--involve the student teacher in a variety of teaching activities; (c) teaching--gradually move from participation into the teaching process; (d) planning--gradually move the student into the planning stage; and (e) conferring--be constructive when criticizing and encourage self-appraisal. It is the job of teacher supervisors to share the knowledge gained from experience and to be receptive to the ideas of the student teacher, thereby improving the worth of the teacher and student.

Evaluation of this program was based on standardized interviews, a schedule of time spent, and assessment of student attitudes about the program. Results of the evaluation indicated that Dynamy is viewed favorably by its intern participants and that it creates an atmosphere for learning which differs sharply from other traditional or innovative atmospheres. The growth and  maturation of students through the year as evidenced in the standardized tests of their image as well as in their general self-assurance in interviews indicates that the experience has helped those involved to become more thoughtful about making decisions in their lives, to become more mature about handling themselves in a variety of situations, and to become better able to communicate with others in their program.

The students are also provided with a supervised teaching experience based on the theoretical framework they are learning. The evaluation focuses on the overall objectives of the program, which state that a student will be able to (a) list the strengths and weaknesses of any evaluation instrument, (b) assess children's needs through the administration of specific evaluation instruments, (c)  write behavioral objectives, (d) design an instructional strategy, and (e) identify himself as a member of a professional team. The control group consisted of students who had completed special education methodology courses prior to initiating the experimental integrated program. Tests were constructed to measure attainment of program objectives and were administered to experimental and control group participants. Results of the tests show no significant differences in the attainment of any objectives and suggest that when the experimental integrated program is refined, it will produce more capable special education teachers.

Recent research has also shown a correlation between body build and personality traits, and it appears that particular athletic activities attract certain types of individuals. For instance, two researchers in separate studies concluded that weight lifters were shy, lacked self-confidence, and were concerned about their appearance. Nonathletic games have also been studied, particularly chess and bridge. The two games are different in that chess is a logical and analytical game while bridge is psychological. This difference determines to some extent the type of persons who are likely to become experts at each of the games. The results of the Athletic Motivation  Inventory, distributed to 15,000 athletes, show that those who survive the high attrition rate associated with athletic competition are characterized by a great need for achievement, orderliness, respect for authority, a large capacity for trust, and great psychological endurance. The implications of research into games and personality for talent scouts and professional gamesters are obvious, but the implications for the remainder of the population are not so clear. There is a need for more study of the games and pastimes of the majority of Americans who do not engage in competitive athletic activity. (HMD)",

Thirty male students were given 20 trials on each of the tasks. A correlation matrix of task variables was computed and learning curves plotted. Results indicated that an individual's ability to perform one visual cue perceptual-motor task is relatively unrelated to performance on another task. Positive learning was demonstrated on the two-dimensional tasks (pursuit rotor and light panel), but the slight learning progress demonstrated during the early trials of the  coincidence-anticipation task was almost negated during the final five trials.

Sargent demonstrated a life-long commitment to two purposes: to prepare those to teach physical education to others and to promote exercises for all people and not just college students. His commitment to the profession was at the expense of his marriage, and it contributed to a separation from his wife and son. The cooperation of Dr. Sargent was shown by his service to various professional organizations, including four terms as president of the American Physical Education Association. Sargent saw some good in all programs in physical education and taught them all at his Normal School and at  Harvard Summer School. In the area of communication, Sargent was a fine speaker and expressed his views on many subjects in a forceful manner both through his speeches and his numerous writings. A fourth C that can be added to the life of Dr. Sargent stands for courage. Sargent was recognized for his willingness to stand up for views even though they might not be popular. His advocacy of the need for reform of college football cost him his faculty rank at Harvard. (Author/JA)",

Forty-four male college students were administered a series of lab and field tests of physical working capacity. Lab tests include a test of maximum oxygen uptake, the PWC 170 test, the Harvard Step Test, the Progressive Pulse Ratio Test, Margaria Test of Anaerobic Power, the Harvard Fitness Test, and Oxygen Debt following the Harvard Fitness Test. Field tests were the 10-yard dash; 50-yard dash; Sum 50's test; 300-yard, 600-yard, and 1-mile run; and the 12-minute run. Variables were intercorrelated using the Pearson product moment correlation method. Highly significant correlation was found between the maximum oxygen uptake expressed in m1/kg/min and the 12-minute run, 600-yard run,  1-mile run, Balke Test, and All-Out Treadmill Run. Moderate correlation was found between maximum oxygen uptake and the Harvard Fitness Test, the 300-yard run, the Astrand-Rhyming Test, Harvard Step Test, PWC 170, and the Progressive Pulse Test. Using Multiple Stepwise Regression, the following multiple correlation coefficients were found: from submaximal tests, .78; from maximal tests, .91; from field tests, .91; from other lab tests, .86; from all tests, .92. Within the limitations of the study, it was concluded that (a) maximal tests of greater than 1 minute in duration may be valid measures of aerobic capacity, and (b) maximal tests are better predictors of aerobic capacity than are submaximal tests.

First, any time a dogma is used to prescribe an educational process, the intellectual areana is truncated; many ideas will not be introduced and pursued because no one has found a way to measure their apprehension behaviorally. Secondly, although some skills can be behaviorally tested, many intellectual activities are not reducible to performance objectives. It is questionable whether it is possible to generate meaningful behavioral objectives for any intellectual  activity or course that requires (a) assimilation of broad reaches of abstract ideas, (b) cohesion of seemingly disjointed concepts, (c) sensitivity and insight, (d) techniques, and (e) new forms of expression. Thirdly, precise specification of the measurable classroom tasks that must be performed can destroy the challenge to excel. The preoccupation with measurable goals does nothing to arrest the predilection of man for pursuing short-term goals to the detriment of his long-term welfare. This is not to say that behaviorism has no place in the educational system; there are many topics that may be amenable to behaviorism--primarily those concerned with the transmission of skills.

        "description":"Selection Research Incorporated (SRI) assisted in the selection of teachers for two school districts in Polk County, Iowa by analyzing audiotaped interviews with the top three or four candidates for each position and matching the candidates with previously prepared profiles of the school districts. Candidates were labeled highly recommended, recommended, conditionally recommended, or not recommended. A 3-year evaluation study of the SRI process was conducted to determine its success by surveying the SRI teachers, their peers, administrators, and students. Data were collected using questionnaires consisting of items related to effective teaching. Using the data, the appraisals of SRI teachers by their peers, administrators, and students were compared with the recommendations of  the SRI psychologists. The following conclusions are warranted based on study results: (a) the SRI process of identifying teachers who are likely to be successful in a given school district is reasonably successful; (b) the SRI method appears to be most successful in identifying probable success in a district where the criterion of success is student rating; (c) SRI is not equally effective in every district; and (d) the SRI service is a useful process for teacher selection if it is used in the manner for which it was designed. When the SRI service is utilized, periodic evaluation is recommended. (HMD)",

The project consisted of a central TTT office; three programs located at City, Hunter, and Richmond Colleges; and 16 schools located in Harlem and Richmond. Of the 849 persons involved in CUNY-TTT who received questionnaires, only 300 returned them with a usable yield of 242 instruments. The sample included project directors and their staffs, public school administrators and teachers, college faculty, student teachers, and community participants. Professionalism was measured by nine items on level of professional activity and support for professional training.  Nine items measured respondents' commitment to the organization, and six Likert scale items measured perceived community participation in decision making. It should be noted that decisional equity, one of the major goals of CUNY-TTT, was not realized. Results of the study show that (a) there is no consistent relationship between professionalism and commitment to work; (b) professionals tend to support increased power for the community within existing hierarchical constraints; and (c) professionalism in CUNY-TTT was in effect neutralized as a factor that contributed to the success or failure of the program.

The purpose of the project is to acquire information about the training system and to use this knowledge as a base for reform of teacher preparation. The project began in 1970 and is expected to continue through 1975. The first year was devoted to gathering information about science and mathematics teachers. Successive years were devoted to modern language teachers, social science teachers, and Swedish teachers. The final year will consist of an evaluation of the teaching practice term and an evaluation of educational psychology studies. Seven instruments have been developed for utilization in the study. Three of these are questionnaires designed to furnish data about the  trainees. A fourth questionnaire examines the attitudes of headmasters toward teacher training. Of the remaining three instruments, two are attitude tests, and one is a test of trainees' knowledge and evaluation of educational psychology.

A common element in the training strategies was the objective of raising the cognitive level of teachers' questions. Although the studies reviewed represent breadth in terms of pupil characteristics and subject matter, elementary classrooms and  social studies instruction were the predominant settings. These studies varied from highly controlled ones to exploratory investigations and evaluated a variety of instructional procedures and materials, making it difficult to draw sharp conclusions. There is a tentative indication that strategies that employ model inputs accompanied by feedback and self-analysis are the most promising. Further research is needed in the areas of teacher training and the relationship between teacher questioning and pupil growth. Such knowledge can then be applied to the search for effective teacher training strategies. A 50-item bibliography is included. (PD)",

This instrument contains evaluative aspects, including the degree of acceptance or rejection of the quotations and evaluation of the professional importance of the problem, expressed by ratings on a 4-point scale. The questionnaire, based on  inventories of factors relevant to the teaching profession, concerns working conditions and job satisfaction in the profession. These instruments were administered after each school year for three years. Group discussions were also used to follow up on qualified teachers who have taken part in former studies.

The underlying rationale for the program is that observation of creative and well-planned lessons would be of invaluable service to trainees. The intravisitation schedule would evolve after informal discussion among team leaders, cooperating teachers, and other participants in the program. From this group, a planning committee for each host school should be selected and given responsibility for determination of curriculum sequence and schedules. The plan then calls for the determination of lesson procedures. Lessons taught by teacher interns are to be prepared and subsequently discussed with team leaders, cooperating teachers,  and principals. Copies of plans should then be distributed to participant observers. Every lesson should be discussed at the end of each demonstration by all observers, with the lesson teacher serving as discussion leader. After informal conferences with the teacher intern, the team leader should prepare a review of the lesson. This review, together with the lesson plan, can be used to assess intern competency in cognitive understanding and teaching behavior. The lesson plans should be compiled in a booklet to be used by per diem teachers, by new teachers, and as a means of modifying instructional activities at the university level. (HMD)",

The prime function of the lead teacher is instructional improvement, and his basic concerns center around the teaching team and children who comprise the unit. The lead teacher has responsibilities both as a member and leader of the team, and as a member of the entire instructional staff. The uniqueness of his position is such that he can and should be involved in the processes of instructional improvement and employment of new team members. While the principal consults and is aware of the decisions and practices of the teams in his building, he asserts more positive leadership in  connection with developing improved educational practices, managing the pre- and inservice teacher education activities of the school, and administering research and development projects. In a school involved in team teaching, a network grows with lead teachers consistently serving as linkage agents between the team and the principal. The effectiveness of a team-organized school depends on the ability of the principal and lead teachers to work together. In a multiunit school, provision for shared, school-wide decision making is made through the instructional improvement committee, consisting of the principal and the team leaders. (HMD)",

Specified competencies should be those understandings, skills, behaviors, and attitudes which facilitate the intellectual, social, emotional, and physical growth of children. In comparison with conventional programs, CBTE seems to offer many advantages: (a) a specific criterion level is established, and persons seeking certification must display competence at the acceptance level before certification; (b) program focus is on goals or exit characteristics rather than on means; and (c) a competency-based program is performance  rather than time based. A CBTE program is based on defined instructional and expressive objectives. Instructional objectives call for demonstration of specific competency and include conditions and criteria for its demonstration, while expressive objectives call for the student to experience a specific event with specification of the outcome. CBTE lends itself to a systematic model of instruction, and many programs use the instructional module which consists of statement of objectives, prerequisites, pre- and postassessment procedures, instructional activities, and remediation activities.

Outlined are activities to (a) develop physical and sensory readiness, (b) develop reading readiness, (c) develop social readiness, and (d) develop self-concept and pride in inner-city youngsters (such as a unit of Black History). Included also is the minimum achievement to be realized from these activities, suggested materials to be used, organization structure and recruitment, and methods  of evaluation. The second, The Development and Study of a Reading Center in an Inner City Elementary School, focuses on an experimental study of fourth and fifth graders with reading problems who are administered the Silvaroli Classroom Reading Inventory. Statistical data are included. The third, Together in Kansas City, Missouri, is a model program designed to bring together children from inner and outer Kansas City areas to enhance their academic, personal, and social experiences, and to demonstrate the value of cultural pluralism as an educational resource.

Experimental groups in both studies scored significantly higher on the posttest than the control group did, and the pre- and posttest group scored higher gains than the posttest only group did. To test user reaction, an instructor questionnaire consisting of 14 Likert scale items and a student questionnaire consisting of 20 items were developed. Instructors felt that: (a) the quality of the film was good; (b) the concepts stressed in the series were clearly defined and understandable;  and (c) the materials were applicable in a wide variety of instructional methods, groups, and settings. Analyses of student responses show that they felt that: (a) the films were worth the class time spent on them, (b) the purpose of the films was clear, and (c) the concepts emphasized in the film would be valuable to them in the classroom. Results of the study show that use of the film led to an overall gain in the ability of students to categorize classroom behavior in terms of a specified set of concepts.

The program runs for 16 weeks and is reality oriented and suburban based. The interdisciplinary staff of the program consists of a sociologist, mental health specialists, and teacher educators. Conceptualization of the SITE program activities was  based on thoroughly tested procedures drawn from the nationally recognized Cooperative Urban Teacher Education (CUTE) program.

Groups who had training were predicted to choose more cooperative rules for structuring an assigned task than untrained groups chose. Established groups were predicted to choose more cooperative rules and to be more cohesive than ad hoc groups. For each of three types of rules, trained groups more frequently selected the most cooperative rule options. Choice of rules was unrelated to the sex of the group or the type of training but was related to behavioral cohesiveness. Cohesiveness  was unrelated to type of training.

The present standardization of teacher classification, certification, and salary schedules does not acknowledge individual teacher differences. Teachers do not fear unemployment. They feel that, as professionals, they are not being paid competitive wages. A solution is a differentiated salary schedule. Professionals work hard because they want to achieve and also because they enjoy doing what they do. Therefore, the teacher who enjoys teaching the most will also have the opportunity for making the most money. If teachers are different in skills and in training, if there is recognition that they are better  teachers, and if there is mobility among the higher-paid teachers--assuming a differentiated staff--then there will be an equilibrium or a standard pattern of wage differential determined by the general supply and demand. In other words, those districts or local education agencies that run differentiated staffing programs will have identified the better teachers and adjusted their salary schedules accordingly. But once those better teachers are recognized by the rest of the educational community, their general pattern of wages will be determined by supply and demand. Since school systems do not slash teachers' salaries but freeze them, the ultimate weapon of the teacher in conjunction with the union is the strike. (JA)",

The first approach involved reorganizing teacher staffing by creating a career ladder to permit hierarchical staffing without freezing faculty in positions that would limit growth, fix rewards, and destroy morale. The career ladder allowed the use of teachers and paraprofessionals in teams organized to provide different services to students, with roles determined by the learning task at hand and the students' need for mastering that task. This approach tended to result in a rigid hierarchy, which assumed that certain teacher functions are always of greater importance than others. However, student needs shift constantly, and an effective teaching team should shift accordingly, which is the objective of the second  approach to differentiated staffing. The second approach involved performance contracting in which teachers, working in teams, submitted bids to the school board, thereby competing with colleagues for contracts to accomplish specified teaching tasks with results measurable in terms of student achievement.

The tenor of the literature reviewed ranged from confidence in the concept as a catalyst for rebirth in teacher education to widespread pessimism because of inadequate research to justify such a movement. This paper consists of five component parts: (a) \"An Overview of Teacher Education,\" which reveals the absence of any single best approach to teacher education; (b) \"Salient Features of CBTE,\" which describes the competency strategy, (c) \"Research and CBTE,\" which denotes the weak knowledge base associated with the movement; (d) \"Evaluation and CBTE,\" which divulges the rethinking needed in the evaluation phase; and (e) \"Other Issues and  Concerns.\" A sample list of teaching characteristics and behaviors, identified by a group of teacher trainers, concludes this papers. A 16-item bibliography is included. (Author)",

        "description":"This paper describes an experience that illustrates how change can be facilitated through the cooperation of elementary school principals, college supervisors, and interested classroom teachers. In the change strategy used, the elementary school principal and the college supervisor combined forces and served as change agents. The school principal recruited teachers and involved the college supervisor in testing the learning center model of instruction, while the teachers worked with the principal and supervisor to introduce learning centers in their class and to work with student teachers throughout the school year. The learning center model includes classroom interest centers that enable several activities to occur simultaneously. Teachers who were using learning centers were in  their own section of the building. The teachers were involved from the beginning and took an active part in determining how the learning centers could be adapted to their classrooms. Seminars were held with cooperating and student teachers and provided teachers with additional information to meet their needs and with a feeling of support. Classes were also held giving university credit and focused on problems outlined by teachers. According to the author, this experience indicates that with an interested principal and college personnel who are willing to work in the schools, new innovations can be effectively tested under the practical conditions of classroom teaching with benefit to both the public schools and the college.

Although the program was successful in that 31 beginning teachers were placed and modules were developed in three discipline areas, the fact that the program development specialist served less than half-time limited the achievements of the program. Within the time limitations, the major facets of the program specialist's role included serving as (a) module coordinator for reading and language arts, (b) demonstrator of desired teaching behaviors, and (c) manager of a feedback system designed to provide significant team members with information for use in strengthening the  program. The drawbacks to the program caused by underfunding of the program specialist's position were that (a) close affiliation with the staff was precluded; (b) development of an overall management system was severely hampered; and (c) field testing and evaluation of modules developed during the course of the project were inadequate.

STEM was designed to contribute toward a solution of the recruitment-retention problem, to utilize and maximize the talents of the students, and to build a more comprehensive teacher education program. The curriculum design is a totally modular, professional, laboratory- and field-oriented model encompassing a complete preservice screening device, cocurricular minimodular experiences, and an accountability instrument for evaluation purposes. The  objectives of the program can be placed in four goal categories: (a) providing diagnostic, laboratory, field, and clinical experiences for the pre-student teacher with emphasis on the practical aspects of teaching; (b) providing preservice experiences for the student teacher with emphasis on experimental and innovative programs; (c) encouraging personal enrichment through a series of intermittent miniclinical experiences; (d) following through in a program that consists of a component to help new teachers face and solve beginning teacher problems; and (e) providing a school services program for cooperating school systems emphasizing skill development for public school teachers.

Two specific objectives were sought. The first one was to determine to what degree the following groups of people, involved with teachers in different capacities and roles, may be in agreement on the stronger/weaker \"teachers\" viewed: (a) selected 9th-grade students, (b) a 9th-grade class, (c) a senior high school class, (d) masters-level students in a graduate education course, (e) full-time teachers in a graduate education course, and (f) doctoral students and professors in education. A second objective was to determine  if the evaluation of prospective teachers made by the group of five 9th-graders would correlate at a high level with the other groups and be reliable enough to serve as sufficient and representative in the evaluation process of prospective teachers. All six groups evaluated the videotaped performance of sophomores involved in a microteaching assignment. The results of the collected data showed significant correlations between evaluations made by five 9th-grade students and by students in both a 9th-grade class and a senior high school class from different schools within the same district. Low correlations were found between evaluations by the five 9th-graders and graduate students, public school teachers and professors. (JA)",

        "description":"Growing from an intense interest in community control of education in the mid-1960s, the National Teacher Corps indicated that its programs must reflect shared decision making at the local level. More specifically, guidelines for programs stipulated that parents, representatives of the local community, state educational personnel, higher education personnel, professional association representatives, teachers, and administrators be involved in collaborative decision making. The suggested vehicle for involvement was identified as the &quot;school-community council.&quot; Unfortunately, guidelines were vague with respect to the nature of the involvement at the local level. Time limitations, bureaucratic &quot;red tape,&quot; and the composition of the local steering committee to include individuals  whose needs are often at odds with each other have compounded the problem. What can be done to make these groups more effective? Collaboration seems to depend a great deal on the clarity with which each of the collaborators understands his or her own goals to program design. In addition, a firm resolution by communities and colleges not to sell their own opportunity to design effective programs for a few dollars will carry a message that real collaboration begins with people.

The 1971 follow-up study of the CUTE program collected employment data from the 295 CUTE and 231 comparison graduates. Data indicated that a significantly greater proportion of the female graduates of the CUTE program teach in inner-city schools and plan to teach in the inner-city schools in the future. A significantly greater proportion of male CUTE graduates remain in the inner-city school. Subjective comments indicate CUTE graduates consider the training program  to be a valuable teaching experience. (MJM)",

The first two observations provided baseline data since the teachers were not aware of the observational or training procedures. Training procedures, following the initial observations, taught 10 categories of positive action by means of setting specific goals, recording self behavior, observing a model, and using feedback from classroom observations. Results obtained from the Positive Reinforcement Observation Schedule indicated an increase of positive teacher actions from 30 to 50 percent.

The instrument, Teacher Affective Sensitivity Scale (TASS), consisted of videotaped excerpts of teacher-learner interactions from actual and simulated episodes. Each simulation excerpt was accompanied by two multiple-choice items. The subjects, preservice and in-service teachers and counseling practicum students, selected the answer from each multiple-choice that they believed most accurately described the affective state of the pupil viewed on the screen. Assessments of scale reliability; scale construct; and predictive, concurrent, and content validity were made. Based on the results of the tests of reliability, it was  concluded that the current form of the TASS can be used as a research tool but not as an instrument for individual appraisal. Because the subject groups employed to obtain validity assessments did not experience a treatment specifically designed to increase levels of affective sensitivity, it was recommended that further validation studies be made.

A more complete understanding of the role played by parental attitudes in the child's achievement, attitude toward school, self-concept, and social development is furnished. Finally, the study offers opportunities to investigate  the complex interactions among home, school, and student variables as they evolve through the elementary school years. Variables chosen for investigation were selected from a wide range of potential variables describing the child, his home, and the school. The 15 instruments which were selected or developed to measure the variables in the study are described, and some descriptive statistics are provided.

        "description":"Some complexities and difficulties in conducting educational research without an adequate systems view are indicated. Educational programs and problems can be differentiated into at least two main streams based on epistemological assumptions. Based on this differentiation, the researcher may apply different techniques and theories from several different disciplines in examining or explaining the behavior of the system. The &quot;closed&quot; systems approach is more closely identified with what the author calls &quot;traditional&quot; or content-oriented education. If, however, the educational program is characterized as &quot;humanistic&quot; the assumptions about &quot;closed&quot; systems behavior and traditional research appear to be contradictory and must give way to the more wholistic, &quot;open&quot; approach. This&quot;open&quot; approach first requires the researchers to examine the problem in terms of the values held or advocated by the program from several different perspectives. When the program can be characterized with respect to its inherent educational values based on an epistemological consideration, a research model which is congruent can be designed. Ideally, the basic program design will have incorporated a research process as an integrated, continuing aspect of the program. Such would be the case if educational administrators and innovators, as well as researchers, adopted an open systems view. (Author/RC)",

Different research contexts were identified in which researchers group observations though interested in relations among measurements on individuals. The consequences of estimating regression coefficients from grouped data were examined from a &quot;structural equations&quot; perspective. A simple linear regression model was hypothesized and then modified by the incorporation of a &quot;grouping variable.&quot; A taxonomy was generated from the modified model so that every possible grouping variable fit into one of four categories defined by the relations of the grouping criterion to other variables in the system. Each category was then examined for bias and efficiency of  estimation. General principles were determined for choosing a grouping method which minimizes loss of information. The complications that arose in the multiple regression case were also delineated. (Author/SM)",

Beginning with the most basic components of a CAS, the individual behavior pattern element is developed, and operational variations affecting alignment and configuration are considered. Five basic measures of a CAS size, density, eccentricity, orientation, and magnitude are calculated and employed to interpret the nature of and changes in a behavior pattern and the associated CAS of a group of 50 individual households during a five year period. The result of the application of CAS analysis to the study of these behavior pattern changes suggest that the concept of contact action space is a useful tool for  behavioral studies and has particular application to planning and potential land use research.

The types of arguments used in this test of transfer dealt with the contrapositive, converse, and transitive principles of conditional logic. The second type of transfer investigated was the ability of students to judge verbal simple deductive arguments written with familiar content which were examples of the principle of inversion, after instruction only on the  principles of contraposition, conversion, and transitivity.

A 20-hour driver improvement course was administered to 238 licensed drivers at Fort Lewis, Washington. Approximately half of the trainees received a program taught entirely by conventional methods, while the other half received a program of similar content but including eight hours of simulator instruction. Results of specially constructed tests indicated that simulators were superior to conventional media for developing good driving habits but were no more effective in teaching driving knowledges or influencing driver attitudes. It was concluded that, while simulation represents a potentially valuable means of improving driver habits and skills, substantial  modification of current simulator equipment and film is needed to attain this potential.

Scanning some Machiavellian works for items to tap the construct, a pool of 71 was constructed by Christie and an attempt is made here to investigate the factorial structure of Machiavellianism using the original 71 items. The questionnaire (Mach II) was administered to three student samples; each item scored by a seven point Likert type scale. The aim was on generalizing to a universe of items from a sample of items. An alpha factor analysis yielded a 24 factor solution. Only those  factors which accounted for 2 percent of the variance or more were retained; the others were assumed to be inconsequential. Data suggest that the dimensions which Christie assigned a priori to the items in Mach II are not factorially independent nor do the results of the present study approximate such a theoretical point of view. Reasons for the discrepancy in results are postulated. (RC)",

Temporal Numerosity is a measure obtained when a specific number of flashes are exposed at a given rate and the number reported is compared with the number presented. Spatial Numerosity involves estimates of the number of dots in a briefly exposed pattern. Word Recognition involves recognizing five letter words that are briefly exposed. Temporal Integration  involves presenting two halves of words or pictures in succession. The task is to combine them into a unitary whole. Eleven subjects were tested. Some subjects were consistently superior, others inferior, on these tasks. Some showed inconsistent results. Two correlations were significant at the .05 level: CFF versus Temporal Integration (rho .70) and Temporal Integration versus Temporal Numerosity (rho .63). All others were insignificant.

The number of tests administered by interns has decreased markedly. The existence of the laboratory changed training experiences and opportunities. Psychologists were free to spend more time talking with the patient and to order appropriate tests, thus their roles as consultants and problem solvers was emphasized. The psychologist was also in a better position to get his information into the system early while decisions were still being made. One side effect caused by the existence of the lab is that interns frequently do not consider it worthwhile to master projective testing techniques, but  see the testing role as one appropriate for technicians, not professionals. Training requirements have shifted, from demanding an intern to demonstrate ability in the use of tests to today's requirement that they be able to evaluate clinical problems and formulate appropriate intervention. This training model has met the needs of the interns and staff and the demands of the setting. (Author/SM)",

Attempts at assessing the creative process fall roughly into two categories: (1) attitudinal phenomena during the creative process and (2) creativity as ability. Attempts at assessing the creative person have relied on elaborate personality tests. Although not developed specifically for studying the creative person, they do present some consistent characteristics among creative persons. Past background and the current environment have been studied by other researchers. This approach has  implications for prediction of creative performance, but little use in evaluating school programs trying to promote creativity.

The subjects were those students enrolled in two sections of an individual intelligence testing course in the fall of 1973 at the University of New Mexico. The scores on two outcome measures--a cognitive examination and a performance examination--were compared and an analysis of covariance procedure indicated no significant differences between the groups on both measures. The range of scores on both examinations (cognitive and performance) was larger for the experimental,  or independent study, group. The number of WISC tests administered by the experimental group correlated significantly with both cognitive examination scores and performance examination averages. A significant correlation was obtained between the number of protocols handed in for evaluation and the cognitive examination scores of the experimental group. (Author)",

Although the CRRS showed general construct validity, the small amount of common variance accounted for by the factors and the low internal consistency reliability of the initial form of CRRS indicate a need for further development before nonresearch use. Because it is further developed than the CRRS, the CRSD showed greater construct validity, and a factor structure which accounts for more common variance. In addition, the CRSD has an acceptable internal consistency reliability of .86 and the general stability of its factors over time has been demonstrated.  However, the internal consistency reliability of the factors should be increased by adding related scales to permit diagnostic use of factor scores. Scale substitutions or modifications should be made, also, to further increase the independence of the factors before this instrument is used widely. (Author/SM)",

Instructions for scoring and appropriate conditions for administering TAMS to students with low reading skills and little experience with self-report measures are described. TAMS was tried out with approximately 280 students, of which 64, identified as leaders, were studied intensively. The validity of these 64 students' scores was tested by means of self-concept inventories, measures of power, teacher ratings of behavior, sociometrics, formal observations of behavior, and academic achievement scores. The 64 student leaders had been identified by  their teachers as either positive or negative in their attitudes toward school. TAMS results confirmed the reported differences. However, it appeared that conclusions about reliability and validity could not be made until the instrument has been used with samples from other populations. (Author)",

The system also provides a conceptual model linking cognitive, affective, and management dimensions of social studies inquiry. The SSOR contains seventeen categories, four realms, twelve sub-matrices, and six segments of &quot;wait time.&quot; Realm I contains five categories stressing verbal behaviors related to learning subject matter. Five other categories of verbal statements (Realm III) stress the meaning of  human experience, knowledge, values, thought, and behavior for man. A third set of five categories (Realm II) stresses verbal statements through which social inquiry can be influenced and managed. The sixteenth category provides for &quot;wait time&quot; and the seventeenth records descriptive noise. Together, these two categories comprise Realm IV of the SSOR. (Author/RC)",

The bipolar adjectives comprised: good-bad, sharp-dull, ugly-beautiful, strong-weak, slow-fast, shallow-deep, effective-ineffective, valuable-worthless, intelligent-stupid, and honest-dishonest. Tests were translated into Chinese, German, and Spanish; effort was made to preserve semantic equivalence. In perceptions of self, the German mean was lowest, and the Mexican mean was highest. This pattern was repeated in perception of school. Perception of the social  milieu showed that Anglos were lowest; the Mexican mean was highest. Perceptions of other groups was highest in the Mexican group; the Chinese students were low. Based upon an overall assessment, it was found that Mexican adolescents gave the most favorable perceptions, followed by Chicanos, Chinese, American Indians, Germans and Anglos at the bottom with the least favorable perceptions.

Even though selected variables discriminated, overall, the instrument failed to discriminate positive and negative student  attitude groups. (Author)",

California Achievement Test (CAT-70) Levels 2 and 3 subtests measuring Reading Comprehension, Mathematics Computations, and Mathematics Concepts along with a questionnaire describing  student background were administered to a nationally representative sample of ESAA-eligible students. A descriptive analysis of the resulting data is provided and the research conducted to investigate possible bias in the selected measures is documented. Appropriate measures of the debiased scales and the implications of their use are discussed. Finally, methodology employed for scaling the tests for use in interpreting performance within the ESAA-eligible population is presented. (RC)",

Once identified and found acceptable in terms of effectiveness, cost, availability, and replicability criteria, the projects were to be \"packaged\" in sufficient detail so that they could be easily adopted by other schools. Task 1 of the contract involved defining criteria and validation procedures for the selection of exemplary projects and is the research and development effort. It includes a design for a project model, specifications of the  content and media for a Project Information Package (PIP) conforming to the design, and a description of processes which lead to the development of the design and specifications. A design for a project model is a detailed outline delineating what the PIP model itself should contain. The purpose of developing the model design was to establish the media and content of the PIPs and to insure that the type and amount of information to be contained in each PIP model would be uniform, complete, and sufficient to constitute a true blueprint for development of PIPs.

        "description":"This paper examines, both theoretically and empirically, three measures of segregation, with the empirical focus on school segregation. The first measure is based on the absolute deviation of the racial composition of a school from that of the school district, the second is based on the square of that deviation, and the third is derived from information theory. The purpose of this paper is to examine and compare the properties of these three measures in terms of how useful they are both as descriptive devices and as indicators of appropriate policy actions. Separate discussions of the theoretical nature of each index are accompanied by summaries of their calculated values based on a sample of school districts. Several arguments are given for preferring the information theory  measure: it incorporates the notion of diminishing marginal payoff to desegregation; it depends on the entire distribution of students by race across schools; it may be interpreted as a measure of association between race and school assignment; it can be meaningfully aggregated; and, once aggregated, it can be decomposed into \"between\" and \"within\" components. Its main drawbacks are that it is somewhat more complicated to calculate and that its interpretation is not as easily grasped intuitively. The use of any of the three indexes presented here as a policy aid would be substantially better than subjective judgment. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"In a longitudinal study of a 1939-40 birth cohort of Michigan men, the educational, occupational, and earnings costs of discontinuous patterns of school attendance over the life cycle were examined. The intracohort analysis aimed to identify plausible causal antecedents and consequences of discontinuities in schooling in the context of the cohort's socioeconomic life cycle. Men who either had delayed postsecondary schooling after leaving high school or had interrupted postsecondary matriculation achieved fewer years of total schooling than those who experienced continuous enrollment, controlling for socioeconomic origins, educability, and aspirations. Moreover, men undertaking nonregular (noncollege) forms of postsecondary schooling completed fewer (certification) years of school  than did college enrollees, after taking into account differential periods of school attendance and the varying social origins, educabilities, and aspirations of these men. For men who completed equivalent levels of education, the college matriculant secured a more prestigious first full-time job than did the nonregular school graduate. While educational discontinuities had no net impact on within-occupation earnings differences, men who had been age-grade retarded in high school earned less annually ($2,440) than did their statistical counterparts.

        "description":"Too much of the debate over the five-year, 30 billion dollar program of State and Local Assistance has focussed on its presumed or theoretical impact. Too little has dealt with what actually happens when the quarterly Treasury checks arrive at the local level. Local-level studies that are under way concentrate heavily on the fiscal impact of revenue sharing, but at least three other issues are of major concern: the amount and quality of citizen involvement in GRS decision making; the efficacy of mandated protections against discrimination; and, the extent to which GRS is being used to meet the needs of the poor and near poor. In order to clarify such issues the National Revenue Sharing Project has conducted an intensive, 18-month survey of GRS in some 60 localities. The survey  was carried out by local members of three organizations. The citizen monitors worked from a very detailed, demanding survey instrument. They collected comprehensive demographic and budget data, looked into newspaper files and relevant documents, and conducted an average of 30 interviews with elected officials, department heads, media representatives, and community leaders. Their submissions enable us to make important judgments as to how the GRS program is working at the local level. The present report covers the results of the project survey of 26 medium and large cities and seven urban/suburban counties. (Author/JM)",

Moreover, the experience gained in these reviews stimulated the development of the minimum recommendations which the council worked to incorporate in current legislative initiatives. The council explored and discussed these mandates at meetings with parents, community leaders, teachers and administrators at all levels. In 1973, the  council brought all the State Title I coordinators together for the first time. The success of this meeting led to two subsequent meetings in 1974. The council also met with migrant coordinators, chief State school officers and representatives of school boards, administrators, teachers, and parents. In addition to exploring and discussing the legislative mandates, issues of importance relating to the following topics were addressed by the council after meeting with the individual groups: Title I formula, self-concept, staff development, school finance, bilingual programs focus, and technical assistance.

The government, consequently, was in a position to undertake far-reaching decisions concerning population redistribution. The instrument to accomplish population redistribution was to be a network of small and medium sized urban settlements, located away from the densely populated coastal plain, which have become known as &quot;development towns.&quot; They are, then, related to suburbanization in a peculiar way, in that their construction constitutes a governmental response to an unwelcome process of metropolitan growth and suburb proliferation. These new towns have been the focus of much concern. They are populated by recent immigrants, particularly from less developed lands. Many are  isolated, outside the main stream of Israeli society geographically as well as socially. For these reasons, the settlements constitute, in many respects, a second and inferior Israel. This paper considers how these settlements have influenced: (1) the areal distributions of different ethnic (country-of-origin) groups, (2) the tendency for each group to be concentrated in certain industries, and (3) the occupational opportunities available to the members of an ethnic population. In the concluding section, the relevance of these considerations for understanding the role of community in ethnic stratification in America is reviewed. (Author/JM)",

The aim was to create a school in which the ethnic mix of the student body was a microcosm of the ethnic mix of the larger community. In addition, a new organizational school system, modeled after the interest area format of informal British primary schools, was an integral part of the proposed educational plan. The school was funded as part of a larger federal project, Project UNIQUE, that was initiated by the Superintendent of the Rochester City Schools. The school was located in an inner city building in Rochester. The faculty was chosen for teaching skill, interest in innovative education, and for special knowledge and  skills such as art, science, and manual arts. In planning the school, rooms were set aside as interest areas devoted to art, science, crafts, etc., but contained many other materials and activities as well. Children were assigned to family rooms in the morning and were allowed to choose the interest area of their choice in the afternoon. A family room teacher is primarily responsible for the basic instruction in language arts skills and number skills. He individualizes instruction and keeps records of each pupil's progress in the major subject areas. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This book advocates that a teacher in a biracial setting examine his own attitudes toward members of other races so that he can develop satisfactory working relationships with them. Many stereotypes and distortions do disappear when black, red, brown, yellow, and white teachers--out of mutual concern for the education of all children--meet and discuss common problems. Having examined one's own beliefs, values, attitudes, and behaviors in a multiracial setting, and having proceeded to identify, examine, discuss, and discover new feelings about one's racial attitudes, the next important consideration is the teacher's relationship to his pupils in and out of the classroom. Effective teaching requires good teacher-pupil relationships. Teacher's attitudes toward their colleagues are  extremely important in the day-to-day routine. In attempting to integrate a desegregated teaching situation, black and white teachers should continue to develop an attitude of acceptance of each other as professional colleagues. A professional commitment to teaching begins with the teacher's acceptance of his share of responsibility by striving to establish wholesome teacher-parent relationships through open, honest, frequent, and pleasant (if possible) communications with parents, to the end that the children he teaches will be the chief beneficiaries.

        "description":"Since the 1950's a number of large-scale intervention programs have been created to promote equality of educational opportunity among diverse social groups through the provision of additonal resources to the educational environments of selected students from disadvantaged backgrounds. At the secondary and postsecondary levels, such programs have usaully sought to raise the academic achievements and motivation of selected students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and increase the numbers of such persons graduating from high school, enrolling in college, and graduating from college. Although these intervention efforts have been in operation for many years, little is known about their collective impact on the targeted populations. The present report attempts to alter this  situation by reviewing and synthesiging the available literature as to the effects of intervention programs at the secondary and higher education levels. Making such a synthesis is a difficult and hazardous enterprise. Problems arise because many of the studies have looked at different outcomes, for different populations, at different points in time, in different educational settings, using different measures and different research designs. In addition, there is the difficulty of determining the reliability and validity of a study's findings. On the whole, virtually all of the evaluations are seriously flawed. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Research was conducted in a rural Hawaiian school and community among kindergarten Polynesian-American children and their families in order to determine what situational attributes and home environments were associated with better school performance. Classroom behavioral observations were conducted, the teacher was asked to evaluate the student, each child was individually interviewed, and other family information was collected using ethnographic fieldwork methods. Upon evaluating the data, differences were found in the frequency of task or work oriented behavior which varied according to the number of siblings in the family. That is, children from smaller families attended to the teacher more closely and they were more frequently found to be &quot;on-task&quot; during the behavioral  observations. Some Sex differences in behavior were also noted. Girls were more likely to use their verbal communication channels to meet the demands of the classroom setting than boys were. Hawaiian children are expected to learn through the combined processes of close observation, social imitation, trial and error and without the benefit of indulgent or encouraging parental reinforcement for academic work at home. So it seems obvious that problems arise when they enter a school system based on principles of intentional instruction. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The American Revolution transformed the American colonies into republics, which meant that ordinary people were no longer to be considered &quot;subjects&quot; to be ruled as they were under a monarchy. They were thereafter to be citizens--participants themselves in the ruling process. Because the process of creating of a republican citizenry seemed so simple for us, we have believed it ought to be simple for others. It seems to us to be merely a matter of allowing the people to vote. Because voting is the most obvious means by which the people participate in politics, we have tended to emphasize the right to vote as the necessary and sufficient criterion of democratic politics. But this is a mistake. The suffrage is clearly a prerequiste for democratic politics, but it is hardly all there  is to it. It is important for us in our bicentennial celebrations to examine our Revolution and its heritage and to seek to understand the sources of our political practice and values. Only with knowledge of the conditions that underlie the principle of consent in our polity can we confront the world and the future. Voting is in fact only the exposed tip of an incredibly complicated political and social process. How this progress came about and how the people became involved in politics are questions that lie at the heart of the American Revolution. (Author/JM)",

The projects took three main directions: (1) training of minority journalists; (2) opening broadcasting to more and better coverage of minority affairs by means of advocacy in the administration and interpretation of broadcast law; and, (3) supporting organizations committed to produce material about minorities and matters that concern them. This report summarizes the experience. Since 1967 a far greater number  of nonwhites have had bylines in the press (though the American Society of Newspaper Editors reported in 1974 that probably no more than one per cent of the professional newsroom staff come from minority groups) and there are more minority-group members on television working as both journalists and entertainers. The communications industry may not become substantially more sensitive to the minority experience until members of the minorities attain policy-making positions, and so far very few have made it to the executive suites of the mass media.

This paper focuses on the mechanisms that produce discrepancies between men's skills and the requirements of jobs, and discrepancies between men's aspirations for status and income and the wages and prestige a job provides. The paper outlines a number of concepts relevant for the analysis of the occurrence of such discrepancies: characteristics of the production of skills and aspirations, characteristics of jobs such as the nature of competition they generate and the  flexibility of tasks, and characteristics of the labor market such as the rate of change in job content, employment levels, and the distribution of information about job opportunities. Finally the paper attempts to specify some of the organizational characteristics that determine the strength of the relationship between actual discrepancies between job and men and job attitudes.

The introduction discusses the trend away from programs and facilities designed around the use of cars as the sole educational system to the planning of more flexible-use spaces for free-standing engines, transmissions, chassis assemblies, and hydraulic systems, whether they are for automobiles, airplanes, or snowmobiles. In the new mechanics programs the mechanics simulator, trainer, and mock-up areas of the  laboratory should represent as much as 70 percent of the student stations to provide skills required to tune-up and repair all types of engines.

The basic objective is to determine whether they are perfect substitutes, especially whether ADN graduates can adequately replace diploma graduates as the base of the profession. The measurement of the performance of the RNs is indirect. The job market outcomes for RNs of different educational backgrounds reveal the implicit evaluations by employers of RNs. Regressions of the probability of employment in various nursing jobs as a function of RN education, work experience, and various personal characteristics are used for this analysis. The RN wage  structure is also examined to determine whether there is consistent wage differentiation between the various RN preparations. The data were developed through a mail survey of a random sample of California resident RNs. A response rate of about 80 percent was obtained with three mailings, yielding 942 employed RNs for the analysis. Conclusions are that ADN graduate and diploma graduate RNs are indistinguishable; they are paid the same wage, and their job distribution is the same when work experience is controlled. However, diploma graduate RNs cannot substitute for BSN graduate RNs. They are paid similar wages when job area is controlled, but their distribution among job areas is markedly different. (Author)",

Two types of earnings and wage rate equations were estimated by ordinary least squares for all Federal and all private workers and eight race-sex groups of Federal and private workers. The data came from the 1960 and 1970 Public Use Samples. Ronald Oaxaca's technique for analyzing differentials was employed to decompose the estimated differentials into a part attributable to differences in characteristics between the two types of workers and a part ascribed to economic rent paid to Federal workers. These results  indicated that Federal earnings and wage rates exceeded private in both years for every group examined. The largest proportion of the differentials, over 70 percent in most cases, for most race-sex groups consisted of economic rent paid to Federal workers. It was concluded that the source of this is the Federal career employees system. It was recommended that the number of applicants at each Federal job level be weighted in considerations of Federal pay raises.

The first section explores the revival of interest in old occupations and crafts of earlier times, resulting in the development of an appreciation for modern methods of production. Also featured are craft fairs sponsored by various organizations, which can be used by teachers. Contact persons are listed. Twelve of New Jersey's historic sites and museums are described with such relevant information as the hours the sites are open, when tours are scheduled, and a description of the special features of each historic site. Also listed are 75 craftsmen willing to give demonstrations  which can be seen at craft fairs, historic sites, or their own workshops. Additional resource materials are cited, including information on some models to make and things to do related to early New Jersey life, and printed resources helpful for understanding New Jersey's historic occupations.

        "description":"The personnel function in industrial society has been marked by crisis, reappraisals, struggles for power, and guilty conscience. The profession is again under pressure; company management often questions its contribution to the solution of strategic personnel matters, while employees and their unions question its values, and wish to place its actions under the control of the employees. The description of the present situation must be based on tendencies toward change which have already had effect. Some of the tendencies which we may observe in action at present and which will influence personnel work in the future include: (1) movement toward a postindustrial society, with industry's principal branch being services and the basic conflict between the capital owner and the worker  giving way to conflict between the professional and the layman; (2) movement toward a realignment of power, between the company and society and within companies, prompting considerable personal development on the part of employees and necessitating new company organization; (3) movement toward a more humane technology; and (4) movement toward a more open and more flexible company organization. Personnel officers must become realistic specialists in people, able to analyze values and processes of change in different situations. (Author/AJ)",

Recruitment from outside seems necessary to satisfy demands, but migration creates at least as many problems as it solves. The consumption of theoretical training through the university level (a consequence of affluence), produces young people who face a working world with no use for their qualifications. More serious is the number of people waiting to enter working life without being admitted: women, older people, the handicapped, the very young. We must use a different approach to meet a different situation. Working conditions, broadly speaking, job content, and participation become more important and influence turnover and  recruitment. The (government) employment service has to adapt itself to conditions on the labor market: consistently surveying available potentials, to give reliable advice to industry; providing entry-level training; and offering vocational guidance, training, and intervention for women. Inplant rehabilitation for the handicapped is an employer responsibility, but the employment service should devise other training programs for the handicapped who have never been employed. Education and job requirements must be linked. Results depend on employers, actively supported by trade unions. (Author/AJ)",

        "description":"Organization Development (OD), conceived by behavioral scientists to humanize psychological aspects of working conditions which deprive employees of opportunities to develop and utilize their inherent resources, is based on the assumption that human resources can be released if people are given other conditions for work and cooperation. There is no uniform theory or practice, but five areas must be considered for perfect OD, presupposing economic and political conditions encouraging to optimal terms for the organization's internal conditions: (1) Human relationships, or, the cooperation mission. It is naive to start cooperation training without changing the methods by which the leaders have been selected and trained to be competitive and ruthless. (2) Production technology, or,  tool modification--largely a question of manipulating &quot;the world of things.&quot; An entire industrial culture will have to be eradicated first. (3) Organizational structure, or, flexible work divisions. This issue is inevitably ideological and political. (4) Organizational ideology. For OD, the underlying ideology is person-oriented, the welfare state's breakthrough in the working life. (5) Relationship with external environment. Many believe OD is impossible without extensive changes in society. OD means action which secures for all members of an organization adequate terms for sound and all-round cooperation (participation). (Author/AJ)",

The central problems, therefore, have been to build up involvement, commitment, and competence in the work-force, so that the responsibility or &quot;ownership&quot; of the project is taken over by those affected by the changes. The strategy has been to work through the existing (management and union) power structure, to set up a limited (in time and space) experiment or demonstration in a shielded area, and let the &quot;force of the example&quot; be the dynamic factor in the diffusion process in the  whole plant. To make the first step toward experimenting with new forms of work organization and job design, establishing autonomous work groups has been quite effective. (Before dealing with implications, the speaker describes fairly concretely two cases from projects in which IDP has been involved.) The autonomous work group system has to be combined with training and supported by a system of resource persons or departments able to contribute in joint problem solving. (Author/AJ)",

Nevertheless, many youths in industrialized Europe leave school for work at 16; losers in the generalized school, they resist further learning. Schools should provide a variety of learning situations, and work experience should be given equal competence with academic learning. Where learning has been pleasant, adult education can be effective in achieving greater democratization and equality--whose forms must be decided by political authorities, not educationalists. For adults, the closer the connection between learning and living or working, the more effective the education. The trainer's task is arranging a work situation which makes  informal learning go on all the time. A close cooperation between the school and the world of work will be necessary for both, and their integration must be carried out at the local level. Adult education will necessitate changes in work organization, to offer sufficient scope for learning and personal development. Co-determination, however, will have to take place within the general aim and framework of the management process. Equal opportunities can only be achieved within a total system which is a common responsibility, supported by the whole nation's financial resources. (AuthorAJ)",

Major problems include the number of large, highly centralized organizations; people's changing values; work-education and industrial-welfare gaps; the absence of forms to replace unacceptable authoritarian control; the effects of electronic information and communications systems; the bureaucratization of trade unions and professional associations; and the development of &quot;specialist power.&quot; We face the colossal task of redesigning major parts of the industrialized world, to set in motion the learning and development process that may spring us from our self-created trap. First, one technology cannot any more be taken as given; second, we must debureaucratize the work organizations and  their interrelated institutions. Modern technology makes possible much smaller, simpler, and efficient factories, superior in social terms; they require changes in our basic ideas of work and education. To prevent technological and economic planning from taking precedence over social criteria, a participative design process must take place, in which the roles of specialists are changed. It is possible to choose between basically different forms of work organization. (Author/AJ)",

Section 1, briefly considers adult education laws in Texas, definitions used in adult and continuing education, enrollment eligibility, teacher preparation, and the organizational structure of adult education, and outlines required report forms and their completion. The longest section of the document, Section 2, is intended to help the new teacher understand the needs, learning habits, and attitudes of new learners and his responsibilities as their teacher. Characteristics of adult learners, behaviors affecting black-white relationships, and methods of  assessing the needs and evaluating the progress of adult learners are described. Methods of motivating the adult learner and qualities inherent in the good adult education teacher are discussed. Questions that teachers should ask their director; procedures and a checklist for evaluating materials; the Gunning Formula to determine adult reading grade level; the learning environment; General Educational Development Program; and teaching English as a second language are also discussed. A 12-item bibliography is appended. (NH)",

        "description":"The Continuing Education Unit (CEU) has come into the American higher educational scene as a relevant response to public needs. The need for some kind of measurement for noncredit continuing education was established at a nationwide conference. The CEU--10 contact hours of participation in an organized continuing education experience under responsible sponsorship, capable direction, and qualified instruction--can be used in many ways in many areas, from measurement to participation recognition and from adult liberal education to professional continuing education. Administrative standards need to be established to ensure discriminating use of the CEU. The National Task Force on the CEU detailed such requirements, and the College Commission of the Southern Association of Colleges  and Schools' adoption of the CEU furthered the establishment of standards. (Some workshop materials and organizational models are included in the paper to facilitate understanding of the CEU's proper application.) Implementation of the CEU while acknowledging its strengths and weaknesses is one response higher education can make to the need for ensuring quality of results and equality of access. (AG)",

It was established by a national task force from the National University Extension Association following a national planning conference and may be used in a variety of ways: measurement, recording, and verification of adult participation in programs, among others. Administrative concerns regarding the CEU focus on the number of units to be granted, the educational merit of the program, the evaluation of the participant's performance in the program, and the maintenance of relevant records. There are many possible applications of the CEU,  and some areas in which its application is not appropriate. Discrimination in its use must be employed. Implementation of the CEU was facilitated by its adoption by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in December 1971. The association has developed guidelines for use and implementation of the CEU for institutional membership. Large potential users of the CEU are professional societies and associations, business, industry, labor, and government. (AG)",

        "description":"The requirements of career education hit practicing teachers in Florida long before universities began to indicate an interest in their dilemma. Since career education is a concept that can potentially alter teaching strategies and emphases, the study proposed to assess the present attitude toward career education concepts of a group of public school teachers and of a sample of university students in the process of being trained for public teaching positions. The results indicate a significant difference in the two populations. Undergraduate students were more favorable toward career education than the public school teachers. This difference raises questions about attitudinal changes of teachers and about occupational awarenes before entering the teaching field. An investigation  of these questions by education departments within universities is needed due to the trend toward continual, life-long education in our present society. Data for this study were obtained through administration of the &quot;Career Education Survey&quot; and were analyzed by multivariance, the survey instrument and a table representing the component analysis are appended to the document.

In each group of 48, 40 received questionnaires, 3 were interviewed, and 5 comprised a replacement pool. A questionnaire survey and an interview schedule were constructed. The data from those instruments determined that most occupation education instructors have bachelor's degrees; about half have taught in the field five years or less. The instructors define the major goal of their programs to be the transmission of job related skills and consider the goal is generally  being achieved. Enrollment in their programs is increasing, materials and equipment provided are adequate, and local program directors were sources of greatest support. Safety practices were emphasized more, and citizen advisory groups were more commonly employed at the community college/technical institute level. A majority of both levels of instructors felt a need for program changes and professional development programs. Barriers to program development were felt to be finances and administration/organization. (The questionnaire and the interview schedule are appended.) (AG)",

Professional nursing appeared to be the area of greatest need and served as the project's focus. Data were gathered from questionnaires received from 63 percent of the total sample population of 11,490 licensed, inactive professional nurses in New Jersey. Common blocks to employment were low salaries, lack of part-time employment opportunities, need for refresher courses, and  lack of child care facilities. Most of the respondents indicated a preference for part-time work in a hospital setting. Twelve recommendations were made toward solving the problems cited by the inactive nurses, expanding the data collection subjects, and initiating programs. A variety of activities followed: conferences, meetings, and additional surveys.

To document these abilities and skills that minimally performing adults must have and to identify characteristics distinguishing the successful from the nonsuccessful functioning adult, field interviews were conducted with 49 individuals in 25 State and Federal agencies and foundations whose work related to minimally performing adults. A nationwide field test was conducted which, together with the earlier interviews and a literature search, enabled project personnel to  identify nine general areas in which minimally performing adults must be able to function. Objectives and tasks were assigned to each of the nine areas. The general knowledge areas are: occupational knowledge, consumer economics, health, community resources, government and law, and transportation. Basic skill areas are: communication skills, problem solving techniques, and interpersonal dynamics. (A 10-page bibliography is included.) (AG)",

        "description":"The goal of the POR FIN research design was to develop a language-based curriculum emphasizing the audiolingual approach and integrating academic and social-functioning subject matter. The modular curriculum is designed so that each lesson is independent and complete in itself, and provides a high degree of motivation, retention, and achievement for the undereducated bilingual adult. The document is divided into three major sections. The first section describes the research methodology employed, the structure of each lesson, and the measurement and statistical devices utilized in the study. The analysis and presentation of the controlled experiment's test results are offered in part 2. Four student performance measurement devices and other variables are described and analyzed to  evaluate the POR FIN curriculum. They comprise a passive language and math test, a self-concept rating scale, a language proficiency rating scale, and a social-functioning test. Data from administrator, teacher, and student questionnaires are analyzed. In part 3, results of the study are interpreted. Conclusions reached were that the experimental group achieved better results in the following areas: (1) retention was higher, (2) testing recorded greater achievement, and (3) questionnaires recorded significantly positive reactions. The appendix offers over 100 pages of data analysis and the testing instruments utilized. (MW)",

The guidelines first present the rationale for career education, (defining it and distinguishing it from occupational, vocational, and technical education) and present the rationale for involvement of guidance staff in its implementation. The second section reviews some of the basic theoretical concepts of career development: trait-factor theory, sociological model, developmental theories, personality style, and psychological needs. Nine basic assumptions incorporated into the State guidelines are presented. Five phases describing the  framework which may be used to develop a career education program over a period of time are itemized: readiness, awareness, exploration, reality-testing, and confirmation. The third section presents general and specific objectives as they relate to self, world of work, and career planning. Guidance services, discussed in part 4, include counseling, assessment, placement, providing occupational information, curriculum development, and research and evaluation projects. The final section presents implementation strategies in relation to influencing factors. A general bibliography (4 pages) and a list of selected readings (two and a half pages) conclude the document.

Predicted around two major concepts, completion and success, the program was flexibly constructed and based on the modular concept. During the two-year grant period the following objectives were attempted: (1) to integrate the educational program with the Thresholds rehabilitation program, (2) to develop and test techniques and methodologies, and (3) to establish ties with the  community. Problems related to the hiring of qualified teachers and the changing nature of the population were encountered. Volunteer teachers contributed greatly to the program. A manual designed as a guide for structuring basic education programs for former mental patients and emotionally disturbed persons is appended.

The methods were: (1) a paraprofessional training program for six former ABE students in still photography, color film production, and television technique, (2) development and production of media materials by the paraprofessionals for a county broadcast enrollment campaign, and (3) exploring and experimenting with various approaches for an effective ABE television curriculum. Thirty-five television/radio community messages, mainly one minute long, were produced during the first year and are included in the appendixes. These messages, interviews with  students in ABE classes, reflected student opinion of the program. Eight half-hour documentary films were completed, three of which dealt with Mexican-American problems. Two major workshops were conducted for area ABE teachers and administrators, and the television curriculum approach resulted in the production, \"The Job Application.\" Types of project problems encountered during the first year are discussed. It was recommended that: the second-year program be expanded to 12 paraprofessional trainees; materials be tested for effectiveness; more television instructional programs be produced. Appendixes consist of approximately 100 pages. (EA)",

During the second year of the project, objectives were narrowed to a focus on the testing of the direct media production method as a promotion technique for ABE. The concept of direct media placed emphasis on real people telling their unrehearsed, true stories. Project Reach demonstrated that direct media materials produced by  paraprofessionals can be a highly effective promotional tool. In view of the significant enrollment increases made in South Bend, the project director recommends the establishment of a national bank of promotional ABE materials, with basic kits designed for specific parts of the country. Approximately half of the document consists of perspectives and interviews of the 14 project participants; another half is appendixes consisting of: enrollment campaign evaluation, participant observation data, interviews with ABE students, and issues of \"Reach.\" (EA)",

The first phase concentrated on recruitment, relying heavily on public service time available on radio and television for announcements to broadcast a toll-free phone number for further class schedule information for the area. Fewer than 80 calls resulted. Coordination of activities proved complex, and the statewide recruitment effort exceeded available funding. The second phase restricted the number of  announcements and the geographic area reached. The announcements gave general location, cost, sponsor, title of class, and the phone number. This procedure was more successful. An evaluation in the form of intake and exit interviews was conducted providing data on students' sex, marital status, level of education completed, race, and enrollment influences, but it did not adequately measure and evaluate project objectives. Using radio and television as recruitment and teaching devices proved ineffective. (Appended are raw data and announcement scripts.) (AG)",

In the summary report the development of police unions is discussed, and the sources and dimensions of union power are outlined. The report examines the impact of police unionism on labor relations, police professionalism, the authority of the chief, and the formulation of law enforcement policy. The growth of black officers' organizations, in both complementary and adversary relationships with existing police unions, is also explored. The study stresses the indirect impact of police unions on such areas as departmental policy-making, citing \"the  extent to which the police and other chief officials have failed to take action because of anticipated reactions from the union.\" The report concludes that, in the formulation of law enforcement policy, \"the union, regardless of motivation, was essentially a conservative, reactionary force.\" Appended to the document is a six-page bibliography.

Opening sections give background information on changes in the program and discuss, with examples, the need to redefine the target population for JOBS-type programs. Succeeding sections present in detail the need for improvement in the procedures for certifying eligibility of prospective trainees and the need to discontinue the use of occupational skill levels for determining length of training. The report recommends that the Department  of Labor ensure that prime sponsors who carry out JOBS-type programs under CETA (Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973) limit training to disadvantaged individuals who require costly on-the-job training and supportive services; and provide payments to employers only for the costs of training and supportive services to program enrollees which are over and above those normally provided by the employer. Also, a copy of the report should be sent to all prime sponsors as a case study of problems to be avoided in JOBS-type programs. (Author/NH)",

        "description":"There are real opportunities for women in engineering, reflecting demands created by the dramatic rate of change in society. Increasingly complex technology, fast response time, the demands of production and managerial positions, increased levels of education and sophistication of employees, shifts in motivational needs, and new organizational structures are all factors in the rapidly expanding need for engineers. Women provide a previously untapped resource but are in short supply. Women need to make changes in the areas of: goal setting, competition, and job application skills; men in adjustment to working, or more successful wives. Couples should prepare to resolve conflicts over relocation, travel, and the role of the working mother. Industry needs to change in the areas of:  stereotyped attitudes, traditional social conditioning, application of motivational factors, minimizing separations from the industrial climate, participation in more co-op programs, flexibility toward married career couples, closer relationships with universities, and broadened career paths for women. There probably will not be enough qualified women engineers for opportunities existing in the 1970's. Dramatic change in industry and educational institutions must occur if we are to respond realistically to the tremendous opportunities for women engineers. (Author/NH)",

Major emphasis was placed on nonlearning problems of the urban poor. Problems examined were: (1) the economic, sociological, psychological, and environmental conditions of poor whites; (2) planning and organizing flexible adult education programs; (3) developing successful and innovative adult programs; (4) counseling the urban poor, especially the counseling role of the ABE teacher; (5) curriculum directions emphasizing student needs that go beyond the classroom; and (6) professional growth of adult education teachers. Poor white \"grass  roots\" community workers were a major learning experience for participants; other speakers were recognized experts in particular problems of the urban poor. Lecturers were followed up with small group seminars and self-study groups. The major need of institute participants was to better understand the life style, needs, and aspirations of their students so that ABE training can proceed. Three-fourths of the participants found the institute valuable. Approximately 80 pages consist of speaker bibliographies, annotated curriculum materials, and institute agenda and forms. (Author/EA)",

The institute was directed to 100 teachers and supervisors of Adult Basic Education (ABE) in Regions 8, 9, and 10 to acquaint them with the needs and problems of black urban adults. The two-week program was composed of two parts: (1) field trips, short lectures, and presentations to the group as a whole and (2) small group workshops. Since not all participants worked with urban blacks, general methods were presented which, it was hoped, could be used with other ethnic or cultural minorities. Various data were collected in pre- and posttests, followup mail evaluation, and personal in-depth interviews with institute participants to determine the validity of institute assumptions, aims, and goals. The data  indicated it is possible, at least in the short run, to effect a positive change in the attitudes of ABE teachers toward their students. The value of presenting this kind of institute early in an ABE teacher's career was demonstrated, and it was recognized that a combination of cognitive and behavioral input is needed to orient ABE teachers toward teaching adults.

The guidelines are, therefore, written in a conversational mode, as a dialog between the author and an imaginary naive and skeptical manager. General in nature, the guidelines require analysis and interpretation before they can be applied. An introductory chapter on the role of work measurement in performance measurement  is followed by an explication of the need for quality work measurement standards in the planning and control of budget, manpower, and workload. The steps to be taken in establishing a work measurement system are then laid out, from preliminary considerations to staffing and training, and cost and disincentives are discussed. Maintaining performance is the topic of the final chapter. The book is heavily illustrated with graphs and tables; the appendixes include a breakdown of work measurement techniques. (AJ)",

A review of the literature on the lecture method of instruction, the independent study method of instruction, and individual differences included findings in education and psychology, since studies generated by the health professions are not abundant. The study, in determining the effects of the two methods of instruction, the effects of personality (group dependency vs. self-sufficiency, need achievement), and the interaction effects between them, employed  134 first-year undergraduate dental students as subjects. They were administered a standard battery of psychological tests and were classified in the two personality groups and as high or low need achievers on the basis of the results. Achievement test score was the study's dependent variable. It was concluded that instructional methodology, personality type, and need achievement produced no significant differences in performance.

The program revolved around three needs: (1) trained nurses; (2) eliminating the notion that jobs were dead-end; and (3) achieving upward mobility for hospital staff. Curriculum development, selection of students, the counseling program, funding, and methodology are described. The succeeding section reviews program results from three points of view: a detailed evaluation of academic results, showing that the 20 LPN to RN students compare satisfactorily with many students educated in diploma or baccalaureate programs and all 20 passed their State Boards with better than average scores; the students'  evaluation of their experience; and an examination of financial data to identify benefits to the individual, the institution, and the community at large. Student success reinforced belief that a specialized but accelerated program does not adversely affect training. Students' future plans and followup of the program are discussed. Seven conclusions regarding the successful program's elements, students, and upward career mobility end the report. Appendixes include: other LPN to RN programs; career ladder programs; and the Research and Nursing Skills Inventory Questionnaires. (Author/NH)",

A questionnaire was developed and sent to the directors of Title III programs in cities over 100,000 population. After review of the data obtained, four practices were selected for further study: (1) the utilization of paid and volunteer paraprofessionals in ABE, (2) the use of learning laboratories for ABE instruction, (3) co-sponsorship of classes with employers and other organizations, and (4) use of community liaison personnel. During the  project's second year a second national survey of 1,900 teachers in 59 sample cities was undertaken. The second survey examined the perspectives of public school ABE teachers. The findings were then disseminated in four regional workshops. Recommendations are discussed at length in the areas of: differentiating the target population, differentiating recruitment effort, differentiating class types, co-sponsoring with employers, improving instruction, planning short term objectives, analyzing qualitative factors, improving mentor role relationships, planning staff development, and using program innovations.

Training was conducted in 10-week cycles, with 100 trainees at each of two training centers for the two-year period of the grant. The Human Resources Development component was job readiness training conducted by group leaders in informal seminar sessions where trainees were encouraged to identify their skills and resources and to air and explore their attitudes toward work, supervisors, coworkers, family, and society at large. Of 660 previously unemployed graduates with whom contact could be made in the 30 and 90  day followup, 505 were employed. Of previously employed graduates reached, 50 percent had moved to better jobs, been promoted, or received salary increases. The retention rate of program graduates was higher than among regular gate hires. An independent evaluation concluded that the program successfully demonstrated its achievement of educational and employment objectives. A cost-effectiveness system evaluated the effect of training on earnings and the relationship between public investment and the return on investment through increased taxes and reduced welfare.

Various predictor display design configurations were presented to subjects during training trials on an aircraft approach to landing task. Subsequently, subjects were tested on trials devoid of the predictor instrument to determine transfer effects. Each of the predictor display configurations was contrasted with a control or baseline display which did not include the predictor. Results of the study indicated that transfer from a predictor to a nonpredictor display was dramatic; learning was greatly accelerated, and the difference between predictor trained and nonpredictor trained subjects appeared permanent, in view of a rather stable  asymptotes observed during the last 24 test trials. It was concluded that the predictor display accelerated learning through its ability to provide immediate feedback to operators regarding the unique response of the system to control actions. Such feedback enabled operators to learn the complex dynamics of the vehicle much more rapidly than was possible without it. Implications for use of the predictor instrument in wide variety of operational and training applications are discussed.

To achieve a society in which each person can realize his potential requires competent leadership and wise planning. The concept of postsecondary education should be broadened to include post-high school opportunities for all people. It is expected that students will be able to attend the institutions, public or private, which offer programs suited to their particular interests and needs. An all-inclusive educational system, embracing all of education in the State, would provide for continuous learning in  skills and knowledge. The number of students who can benefit from instruction in private vocational schools is expected to continue to increase. Some areas of concern in meeting this need are: veterans' education, degree granting privileges, proposed legislation, accreditation, student loans, and manpower training programs. Private vocational schools are expected to become more involved in a comprehensive system of occupational education, a subpattern within a total system. Regional planning is required for specific objectives. (Author/AG)",

Fifteen cognitive vocational maturity areas were identified; the present form of the test consists of 120 multiple choice items, whose reading grade levels range from 1.4 to 2.2, comprising subtests for six of these areas: fields of work; job selection, work conditions, education required, attributes required, and duties. The CVMT was administered to a standardization sample of 7,367 North Carolina students in grades 6-9. Relatively high Kuder-Richardson coefficients for each grade on each of the six area subtests, and the standard errors of measurement, indicate a high level of reliability. Validity is  indicated by the higher mean scores on all subtests obtained by students who chose occupations in agreement with their field of interest and aptitude level. Mean scores on all area subtests increased across grade levels, thus providing support for the claim that cognitive vocational maturity behaviors are developmental ones. The CVMT itself and an examiner's manual are included in the document. Also appended are the supportive data from the item analysis and reliability testing phases of the development of the test.

Its major purpose was to combine in lessons the teaching of reflective skills with the teaching of ordinary ABE skills. To implement the Tussman model, three experimental groups and three control groups of teachers were formed. Problems were encountered with the development of reflective materials, and several inservice meetings were conducted to help teachers prepare reflective materials. Results indicated that: (1) the Tussman model could be implemented in and adjusted to an ABE program; (2) ABE students could deal with reflective materials adapted to suit their education levels and interests; and (3) the  fact that four types of ABE students were identified in the study suggested a need for the development of alternative routes to ABE. Recommendations are made based on experience gained during the experiment, particularly a recommendation for a four-track program geared to the needs of: slow learners, skill oriented students, combined reflective and skill-oriented students, and nonskill students. Educational materials and student evaluations are appended. (Author/BP)",

        "description":"The Urban Adult Education Institute (UAEI) directed activities in five major areas: professional and continuing education, adult basic education, systems analysis, employment, and community involvement. Because of a time lapse between activities and evaluation, professional and continuing education objectives and systems analysis objectives could not be effectively judged. The evaluation focused primarily on student outcomes and based its data analysis on 62 student questionnaires. The document offers a detailed analysis of the responses related to: (1) demographic information; (2) reasons for attending UAEI; (3) education, skill, and employment levels on entering the institute; (4) organization membership; (5) voter registration; (6) social involvement; (7) the effectiveness of  the institute's job training; and (8) student views of activities, facilities, and outcomes at the institute. It was concluded that, in the area of adult basic education, the program was moderately successful. Mathematics, consumer education, home and family living, and social studies were considered useful areas of study. Staff effectiveness, facilities, and course content all scored high ratings. Reviewing responses related to the institute's effectiveness in job training and retraining, results indicated moderate success. Responses also indicated that participants were active in social, political, and community affairs. (MW)",

For each area the discussion is organized according to a common format: proposed objectives, methodology, and recommendations. The topics discussed in the academic areas are presented in brief outline form. Guidance and counseling services are  emphasized. This aspect of the program has undergone several changes in developing a paraprofessional-oriented teaching and recruiting staff. The need for additional professional supportive help was indicated. Avenues for the recruitment of students were investigated. Funding is necessary for the institute's continuation.

He commented on the Special Experimental Demonstration Projects in Adult Education and Teacher Training Projects in Adult Education and stressed the importance of cooperation between the Arizona State Department of Education and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in selecting institute participants. Three of 22 institutes are targeted specifically for the American Indian. Administrative problems in assigning participant status were  considered in the discussion portion. The Role of the BIA Concerning ABE, was presented by Ed Lentz. He viewed the adult educator as an advocate for Indian interests, in the BIA and in other government agencies as well. He considered the necessary program foci to be ABE and high school equivalency programs (GED) and defended this choice in the discussion segment of the program. Frankie Paul offered supportive comments. Discussion of the final paper, The Role of the Tribal Administration Concerning ABE, is included. (AG)",

Only 10 percent of the participants had prior training or experience in the area. The Institute's purpose was to acquaint teachers with the characteristics and motivational patterns of traditional American Indian culture and its relationship to the dominant Anglo-American society. A participants' evaluation indicates on the basis of 42 responses that the institute was quite successful. The institute introduced problems of adult education for the disadvantaged and emphasized the development of motivational skills. Such topics as use of native materials, curricular materials, ABE and the reservation  resources were examined through lectures, discussions, and field trips. The directions and needs of these ethnic groups, social and economic conditions inhibiting educational opportunity, and the goals of Indian activists are discussed. R.E. Stake's evaluation model to assist ABE directors in systematic information collection and decision-making is described at length. Recommendations are made for continued work among urban Indians, increased ABE programs in Alaska, and publication of Indian curricular materials. (Author/NH)",

The bulk of the document consists of graphs showing pre- and posttest responses for each of the items, presented as raw scores. When changes to a more open-minded attitude were made on the posttest by the Anglo-Americans and Eskimos, they were relatiely large changes, or a change on several items. Changes to a more closed-minded attitude for  these groups were smaller or on fewer numbers of items. Changes made by the American Indians were opposite to the changes made by the Anglo-Americans and Eskimos. Results on approximately 70 percent of the items indicated open-minded attitudes for all groups. The fifth edition of the Rokeach D-Scale is appended. (Author/NH)",

Curriculum materials were provided by the project, but each of the five sites where the project was carried out developed its own strategies. On-site visits determined that the emphasis in the English as a second language segment was on oral skills. Curriculum changes are planned. The physical facilities at the five sites ranged from poor to excellent, and three of the companies involved provided incentives for student enrollment. Students completing a questionnaire at the end of the school  year exhibited a positive reaction to the program. Students who did not complete the program were not surveyed. Teacher responses to a questionnaire were also positive. Interviews with employers demonstrated the importance of their support in the program's outcome. Insufficient data were gathered from standardized tests in one step of the evaluation involving the Ilyin Oral Interview.

With a headquarters at Morehead, Kentucky, and with 13 demonstration or research field stations, the center has already exerted strong influence on adult basic education throughout the Appalachian States. A national impact is also evident. In the evaluation, answers were sought to four questions, stated first in evaluative and then in developmental form. Briefly stated, the questions revolved around the social worth of the center projects; the effectiveness of the organization and operation of the headquarters office; the  effectiveness of the origin, development, and supervision of the field projects; and the success of the field projects in attaining their objectives. A three-phase inquiry conducted by the evaluation team included a library-social analysis (compiled from publications referring to Appalachia), a two-day &quot;specialists' conference,&quot; and visits to the center's headquarters and to each of the field projects.

        "description":"The project was conceived to create a permanent regional staff development system for education of adults. Staff needs were determined by each State in the region (District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia) through a survey. The survey also provided information about unique resources and approaches that could be shared effectively throughout the region, avoiding inefficient duplication. The most significant result of the needs survey was the development of an on-going process for identifying ideal staff roles, the functions to be performed in each role, and the specification of the competencies and criteria levels required for acceptable performance. The project has gone through two phases, a portion of which involved an analysis of participants in  staff development activities. The third phase is to begin in July 1975, and is perceived in terms of factors which would indicate to planners that a permanent staff development system does exist. The regional office provides services and activities to the project in administration, technical assistance, program and staff development activities, and project evaluation. Regional programs for each State outline State objectives and list State staff. (The 100-page appendix provides guidelines, models, and project-related material.) (AG)",

The program was committed to demonstrate an effective and imaginative effort in the Model Cities area for recruiting and instructing hard-core functionally illiterate adults and for teaching English as a Second Language (ESL) to non-English-speaking adults. One hundred adult students enrolled in the program. The most innovative element of the program was the home class method of delivery of ESL instruction, with 30 home study groups of five or more students. The transient nature of the population and subculture conflicts, however, affected attendance and student retention in the program.  Problems related to student evaluation, followup of inactive students, and record keeping are noted. A 100-page appendix includes promotional materials, contact letters, mailing lists, radio and television public service announcements, and press releases.

The main goal was accomplished through the instruction related to the institute's program objectives; (1) how to write and utilize behavioral objectives which will improve their teaching; (2) instruction in the techniques of microteaching; (3) to aid in the understanding and appreciation of the sociopsychological realities and problems of the Spanish-speaking adult; (4) instruction in the most effective methods of  teaching English as a second language and teaching reading skills in an integrated program; and (5) the utilization of the personal growth curriculum in order to meet individual needs. To attain these objectives the institute's program concentrated on the subject areas of cultural awareness, personal growth curriculum, English as a second language, reading and guidance and counseling. One of the most important by-products of the institute was the development of a reading kit for beginning ABE teachers, which is briefly outlined at the conclusion. (BP)",

The skill page set is organized to provide resources, develop understanding, and provide practice or application. A typical set includes review pages, student activity and practice pages, teacher pages, a summary practice page, skill tests, and supplementary resources. Active learner participation and the implementation of individualized  instruction were viewed as favorable outcomes of the revision, but recommendations were made for further changes prior to field testing the materials.

With a view to developing his subordinates' leadership ability and initiative, and permitting them an active role in managing the battalion, he emphasized particularly the principles of \"contingency management\" (motivation by incentives), \"participative management\" (group problem-solving and decision-making), and \"performance counseling.\" Despite some initial resistance by other officers, the experiment paid off in terms of battalion morale, which was rated high, responsiveness, and esprit de corps. Although emphasis was on self-motivation rather than the threat of punishment as a motivating force, there was no breakdown in discipline. Future  development and field-testing will be needed to provide additional information for evaluating the use of such leadership techniques in the Army. (Author)",

Answers were received from 640 or 60.5 percent of the graduates. Selection of participating graduates was made by unrestricted sampling. Questions covered past and present employment, adequacy of high school experience in relation to work or study, factors affecting remaining in school to graduate, and satisfaction with guidance services. An analysis of data indicated that 70 percent of the respondents were satisfied  with the educational program, that no drastic educational program changes were needed, and that a large number of graduates remained in the local area for further education and employment. Business education, science, and mathematics courses were reported as most beneficial. Guidance counseling and teacher performance were considered the weakest part of the program.

Decisions involving 17,752 recruits (2,413 black) and 46 classifiers (eight black) were investigated. Criteria designed to reflect type of assignment and quality of assignment were analyzed to determine if various combinations of recruit and classifier race could account for criterion variance. The nature of the classification procedure resulted in the essentially random assignment of black and white recruits to black and white classifiers. This permits a number of interesting comparisons and obviates  numerous problems inherent in racial bias studies. The major hypothesis that black and white classifiers would be differentially biased in their treatment of black and white recruits was not supported. A second hypothesis that classifiers within either racial group world be differentially biased was also not supported. Sample sizes were so large that classifier bias accounting for as little as one percent of the criterion variance would have been detected as significant. Thus, there was neither statistically significant nor practically significant bias detected among classification specialists. (Author/SA)",

Enrollment for 1973-74 in the engineering technologies is  4,780, representing about 12 percent of the enrollments in all technical education curriculums. Equipment lists are used to meet State standards. Most of the institutions have common administrative hierarchies, but no two institutions are alike, and no curriculum is exactly alike in any two institutions. Accreditation is a continuing process. Present emphasis is on program improvement and development of new programs. Some work is being done on program articulation with four-year institutions. Inservice education activities are conducted to promote quality programs. (AG)",

Aydelotte, which presented an overview of nurse staffing research, 10 papers were presented on variables considered to be significant in influencing the quantitative and qualitative demand for nurse staffing. These included patients' requirements for nursing services, architectural design of the hospital, administrative and cost factors, and social-psychological factors. In addition, papers were presented on the evaluation of quality of nursing care and the impact of computerized information systems on staffing. The papers were followed by presentations by discussion leaders who addressed themselves to points raised in the papers. These  presentaions, the opening remarks of Jessie M. Scott, and a summary and synthesis of the entire conference are also included in the publication. Appended are four task force reports offering recommendations on future directions for research.

The document contains: (1) An examination of the policies and activities of the U.S. Office of Education's (USOE) Division of Adult Education Programs (DAEP); (2) An analysis of the effectiveness of the 309(b) system based on field studies of seven projects and survey findings; (3) An examination and multiple regression analysis of the organizational characteristics of local ABE programs as users of innovations; and (4) A summary of major findings and policy implications. Concluding the document,  recommendations emphasize that a major objective of the 309(b) program is to improve existing State grant ABE programs, and that to achieve this objective, local ABE programs must become more aware of 309(b) outcomes and utilize them. An epilogue offers an overview of Project IDEA (Innovation Dissemination for the Education of Adults), launched in 1973 as the first step toward a national dissemination system. Appended are: a local program questionnaire, USOE DAEP staff questionnaire, State ABE director questionnaire, and the construction of indices of innovativeness, 309(b) adoption, program security, and professionalism.

The evaluation of the project attempts to illustrate how the project was interphased with a total adult education program to achieve its objectives, and to improve the total program. The evaluators visited the project four times during the year for program observation and review, and consultation with the project staff. The program description provided is detailed and comprehensive; the evaluators  have placed the program in context with many tables of relevant statistical data. Evaluation is made with reference to each of the project's specific objectives. Nearly 5,000 adult learners were served during the year, at a total cost slightly exceeding $200,000. The economic level of a majority of the learners did not rise during the project's duration, but the program paved the way for future improvement through the educational progress made. (Author/AJ)",

And, finally, it teaches the traditional three R's as an outgrowth of the participants' environment and personal experience. The program has been refined to the point that it can teach and help every adult on the reservation, of whatever educational background, who is not a victim of brain damage or of personality disorganization. Organizational, enrollment, and inservice training information is  contained in the report, introduced by a 15-page recounting of the history of Hispano-Anglo-Navajo relations. A curriculum overview, an instructor-by-instructor summary of \"special interest\" subjects covered in each classroom, a progress report, and an account of achievements constitute the heart of the document.

Focus was on building a multi-regional teacher capability in ABE through teacher training models. Phase one involved program planning and pre-conference orientation of participants and resource personnel. A three-week on-campus workshop, phase two, centered on an in-depth study of learning modules selected by the participants. Modules selected pertained to: the nature of the undereducated urban adult learner, communication, fostering positive self-perception of urban ABE students, micro-teaching, methods and diagnosis of ABE teaching, teaching  English as a second language (ESL), and diagnosis of local needs and program development. Phase three, designed to actualize the urban teacher training developed during the previous phase, proved to be the most significant part of the project. Through a task team capability delivery system, programs were launched in: Bridgeport; Raleigh, North Carolina; Amherst, Massachusetts; Glenmont, New York. An important outcome of the project was model dissemination at local, State, regional, and national levels.

Chapter 5 considers the crucial problem of communicating and interacting with the deprived. Chapters 6 and 7 attempt to make Chapter 2 more extensive, intensive, and protensive by setting forth  curriculum practices and suggesting techniques, tools, and trends in ABE. Chapter 7 indicates how the total program in adult education may be improved, unified, and made more continuous through the coordinated efforts of administrators and supervisors in the field.

The data generated by the study consisted of the types of recommendations and disposition made for the 65 clients at followup intervals of 3 and 18 months after completion. The model-based system was more productive in developing vocational recommendations and a higher percentage of clients attained and maintained gainful employment over a more extended time interval. Use of the JEVS System produced more  non-vocational recommendations, was more effective in enabling disadvantaged clients to attain immediate employment, and was significantly more capable of rendering consistency between vocational recommendations and vocational status over a short time. Eight conclusions are offered relating to the applicability and limitations of the two systems with respect to culturally disadvantaged clients. Three recommendations are made, based upon the results of the study. A bibliography, and the biographical, evaluation, and followup forms used in the study are appended. (Author/SA)",

Education for adults is the font we must draw on to make possible the new environment in education that we call lifetime learning and recurrent education. Following the lead of Europe in planning broad-based adult education programs, the United States has begun to fund and operate diversified programs. The Adult Education Division of the Office of Education, in a recent study, has identified the minimal needs in all literacy areas for an American adult. Acknowledging that the average reading and computational ability of adults was found to be at the five-year level, we must begin to address the special problems of the functionally undereducated. We must understand the adult student's goals, supply the basic tools within the  specific work and cultural setting, and create habits of life-long learning. If we are to make life-long learning and recurrent education more than a token, American education institutions must become open-ended, built around competency based modules or units of learning. We must include coping skills as well as job skills, the humanities as well as vocational training. All facets of learning are necessary to make the whole person and the whole life. (Author/MH)",

Today, the national organization of resources for career education is receiving a new thrust. The vocational and educational needs of today's students are growing national concerns. The lack of emotional preparation for work as well as goal-centered plans on the part of the young call for new planning from the business-industry community as well as from centers of education. Career education programs have gained support throughout the nation and with Federal and State legislative support have begun to meet these needs. Cooperation of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and the Office of Education with the Department of Commerce and Labor can be seen as Federal  leadership to hasten the collaboration of business, labor, the home, and the school or colleges to give Americans a sense of what work means, how to decide on a field of work and prepare for it, and then, finally, how to find a job.

Generally, the summer programs demonstrated that: (1) school personnel working as teams are better able to solve problems and implement programs; (2) demonstrations and practice with children produce positive attitude changes toward unfamiliar techniques, principles, and programs; (3) when feedback concerning competencies demonstrated during practice with children is provided, personnel are more  willing to implement new techniques and programs in schools; (4) additional instruction and practice concerning weaknesses during practice with children provides workshop participants with a sense of closure.

        "description":"This paper reports on a successful attempt to understand success avoidant motivation and behavior by the development of an empirically sophisticated scoring system of success avoidant motivation and the observation of its behavioral correlates and situational determinants. Like most of the work on achievement motivation, the study was carried out within the conceptual framework of an Expectancy-Value theory of motivation. Within this context, motivation or goal-directed tendencies are considered the result of an interaction between stable motives that characterize the individual personality and other more immediate situational factors, with particular emphasis given to the person's expectations about the consequences of his actions in a particular situation. The scoring system  does not depend on reaction to any one specific cue and avoids most of the major problems encountered in earlier research. It can be used with any number of cues and can be applied to a variety of neutral cues. In addition to the original population sample, a sample of females was used to cross-validate the scoring system by writing TAT stories under neutral conditions and later performing in a competitive mixed sex situation similar to the original study. This cross-validation adds credibility that the system can be applied to a variety of cues. Suggestions for further analysis and study are presented. (Author/PC)",

        "description":"The use of reciprocal behavior contracts with families of behavior-problem adolescents was investigated. Most family contracting to date has involved one-way contracts; that is, the child agrees to certain responsibilities for which he will be reinforced by the parents. A reciprocal contract requires the parents, in addition to the child, to agree to certain responsibilities (or behaviors) in exchange for which the child offers reinforcers to the parents. This novel form of contracting has arisen from serious consideration of the interaction process as analyzed by Thibaut and Kelly (1959) and Patterson (Neuringer & Michael, 1971). The theoretical frame of Thibaut and Kelly suggests that dyadic interactions are reciprocal and that the rewards of the interactions are based upon the  responses of both persons not just one. Patterson's theory also stresses this reciprocity; in addition, his clinical work notes that to maintain parent behavior of reinforcing children for positive behavior, the parent in turn needs reinforcement from the children. In addition to presenting this theoretical framework for a new orientation to contracting with families of adolescents, the paper presents three pilot case studies. Problems with this procedure and suggestions for implementation are discussed. (Author)",

The study focuses on their occupational and educational aspirations and experiences, and the determinants of these. Of the initial sample of 200 women, 152 were relocated and equally distributed among the three groups: Role-Innovators, Traditionals and Moderates. Statistics show that many of the women have married and are taking advanced courses or are studying full-time, and about one-fifth are full-time mothers and housewives. There has been a general shift toward more traditional activities, but aspirations in 1970 indicate a second and larger shift in the future toward more innovative activities. There has been a  significant increase in conflict felt between marriage and a career, an increase in commitment to working, and a significant decrease in the number of children desired. The best predictor in Innovation in 1970 is the occupational aspiration in 1967. Several of the new measures developed in the original study remain strong predictors of 1970 Innovativeness, including \"Demand Character of the Future Husband\" and \"Implied Demand Character of the Wife's Future.\" (Author/PC)",

The clearest formal explication of this view is contained in subjective expected utility models (SEU), in which individuals are assumed to scale their subjective likelihood estimates of decisional consequences and the personalistic worth or utility of each outcome in a choice set. In this study, subjects were trained on assumptionally satisfactory probability and utility scales, and asked to play a central actor in a number of uncertain decision situations modified to include numerical estimates of decisional components. Response format (probability or utility estimation), sex of subjects, order of items, and sex role of items (male or female) were varied in a repeated measures  design. Results indicated subjects made SEU-consistent rational decisions over items, but that males responding to female-appropriate decision situations did not. The results supported the validity of SEU models as a base for social theory and replicated two earlier experiments. (Author/PC)",

The couples noted the benefits and problems of such an alternative parenting system, and offered throughts on how society could change to accommodate such patterns. Thoughts on how professionals in health and behavioral sciences can be of service to couples interested in beginning or maintaining such  a child-rearing style are presented. (Author)",

        "description":"Much of the research on the topic of altruism reads as though the principal developmental problems which face the child are those of acquiring a repertoire of benevolent acts, and deciding under which circumstances those acts are to be put in play. The author suggests that any full inquiry into the developmental course of altruistic behavior must include attention to the processes by which children come to recognize and identify other people's needs, and frame responses which reflect this understanding. He further argues that altruism cannot be defined in exclusively behavioral terms, but must consider the intentions which underlie, as well as the consequences which follow upon, responses to the distress of others. The overly insular approach by other writers to the study of  altruism leads the author of this paper to express the criticisms, concerns and counter suggestions described. By contriving assessment situation which tend to remove from subjects the obligation of recognizing the need for some altruistic gesture, and often relieving them of the responsibility of determining the particular type of help that might be required, research in this area has served artificially to separate altruism from the remainder of the child's socio-cognitive development.

        "description":"Despite its significance, the field of informal peer counseling remains relatively unexplored. This study focused on the therapeutic responses that laymen give to and desire from their peers. In two separate studies, S's indicated their reactions to scripts presented in booklets or on tapes. S's were instructed to respond to these scripts as if the problem were being presented by \"a friend\". As expected, females tended to be more receptive and nurturing than males. These results were consistent with a view of females as more other-oriented than males. Males did not indicate greater usage of any category of response compared with females in either experiment; thus, they did not appear to be more rejecting overtly than females, although they seemed less actively helpful. The  stimulus person's emotions had a major impact on therapeutic responses. Sadness elicited more nurturing responses and more positive evaluations than anger. Sex-of-target effects in both studies provided very weak support for the view that specific emotions would be responded to differentially, depending upon the target sex. The authors discuss implications of these results for peer counseling as a form of preventive therapy. (Author/PC)",

This project compared attitudes of employers toward epilepsy in the early 1960's with their attitudes in the current decade. As a control for possible generalized shifts in employer attitudes toward worker's with any type of handicap, employer attitudes toward workers with two other types of potentially handicapping conditions were also measured. There was a marked improvement in employer attitudes toward workers with epilepsy between 1962 and 1972 with statistically significant improvement in overall attitudes, and in views of epileptic workers' need for supervision and ability to adjust to changing work situations.  Employer attitudes toward workers with emotional disturbances or with a history of juvenile delinquency did show slight improvement, but it was not significant. (Author/PC)",

From a recent review of the research on social cognitive development (Schantz, in press), this paper responds to three specific questions: (1) What is empathy? (2) Under what conditions is empathy likely to occur? and (3) What types of judgements appear to be involved in an empathic response? The difficulty in conceptualizing empathy as something different from sympathy and projection, and the issue of empathy as a process or product, suggests that a more systematic \"nomological network\" is needed for the construct. That such a model has not evolved may be related to the fact that very little is known about the relationship of empathy to the ability to  infer another's thoughts, capabilities, intentions, and perceptions. Given the importance in our society of prosocial behavioral development, it is particularly critical that more systematic investigation occur on the interrelationship between cognitive development and social behavior.

It was noted that the  black females and males studied, unlike the whites, did not differ in their evaluations of women.

Some of these generalizations are: (1) the medical model still reigns supreme, with people in control of community mental health centers interested in little more than treating people in the community--this service means outpatient psychotherapy and inpatient ward management; (2) the caretaker and the advocate differ in how they resolve one of the basic problems of community intervention, setting limits of responsibility; (3) the advocate tends to engage in social action that is potentially disruptive to the social system, while the caretaker usually  designs programs that are therapeutic for society as a whole; and (4) caretakers are often problem-oriented while advocates are people-oriented. Although the impression is given that community workers are divided into two camps--caretakers and advocates--in reality people are inconsistent and situational factors will often determine what stance a worker assumes. Students need to make a choice between the two camps to prevent compromising both positions and ending up working only for their own interests. (Author/PC)",

Individuals rated the importance or utility of each value and the subjective probability that each value would be realized if the couple were to elect to have a (another) child in the next two years. The subjective expected utilities were computed and compared between husbands and wives within the same parity between husbands across parities, and between wives across parities. Husbands and wives were remarkably homogeneous with respect to subjective expected utilities associated with  birth planning decisions in all of the three parity groups.

        "description":"The authors' investigations of the antecedents and consequences of the empathy response have been guided by a three-component model of empathy. Two of these components are cognitive: the ability to discriminate and label affective states in others, and the ability to assume the perspective and role of another person. Emotional capacity and responsiveness constitute the third component. One implication of this model is that social understanding is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the occurence of the empathy response. While the authors review several studies on empathy they stress results accruing from the investigation of the relationship between social comprehension and empathy (Kuchenbecker, Feshbach, and Pletcher, 1974). As the child grown older, the ability to  comprehend social situations increases, as does the tendency to share the affective state of individuals in these social situations. The social comprehension factor becomes associated with the remedial progress in achievement of the child, while empathy becomes more strongly associated with social behavior. The authors predict that those programs which attend to the affective as well as the cognitive aspects of social interaction will prove to be the most successful in enhancing pro-social behaviors.

        "description":"In a variable distance 10-trial ringtoss, it was found that success required that a subject exceed his expected score. Therefore, the probability of success was the probability of exceeding the expected score on the 10 throws (Ps10); and this is shown to be different from the probability of scoring a ringer in a single throw (Ps1) from the same distance. Earlier results presented in support of Atkinson's theory of risk-taking behavior used the same experimental method but tested the theory against Ps1. The same data do not support the theory when analyzed against Ps10. It is suggested that in a multiple trial task, Ps1 represents not a probability of success, but a long term performance level, and that success or failure in any one trial is of small importance. Because these  conditions do not meet the explicit assumptions of Atkinson's theory, a new approach is required to explain the reported motive-related differences in preference for moderate probability of success in multiple trial tasks.

The treatment procedures of specific focus was a skills training package using modeling, behavioral rehearsal, feedback, and in vivo practice as major components. The data from two studies indicates the skills training package effective in reducing dating anxiety and increasing interpersonal skills. The study indicates no significant effect due to the skills training package, but the result may be confounded by the selection of less phobic subjects and less sensitive assessment procedures.

In 53 volumes on various aspects of child-rearing, there is a noticeable lack of discussion on who should bear the direct responsibility for raising children, with only two books covering the topic. About half the books do not have any discussion at all of sex roles in parenting. The remaining half can be arbitrarily placed on a contimuum from those which unquestionable validate the usefulness of strict sex-role delineation in parenting, to those which assume its usefulness and do not even bother to discuss the issue, to those which openly question the value and basis for assuming differences between the behaviors of mothers and fathers. The author offers his own conclusion on  parenting which, abbreviated, is that \"children are not a mother's responsibility, nor a father's... they are parents' responsibility.\" He notes that enough energy has been consumed in the search for the differences between men and women, and fathers and mothers; it is time to search for similarities.

This paper presents the findings of the recently completed evaluation of Army DEP. The study surveyed 1,716 enlisted men at 16 posts about exposure to the DEP and their present and former drug use. In addition, an experiment was performed at one post where the reported drug use patterns of a sample of enlisted men were measured before and after initiation of a formal DEP. Results of the study showed that drug education provided to adolescent and postadolescent Army enlisted men did not affect their drug use. The report postulates that the impact of DEP might have been different had the audience  consisted of young schoolchildren who had not yet tried drugs. Reasons for the failure of the DEP are suggested. (Author/PC)",

Parents of elementary-age school children were asked to read a student progress report for a child whose conduct ratings were good or poor. Attached to the report was a color photograph of a child who had been previously judged to be of high or low physical attractiveness. After reading the student progress report, parents were asked to rate the child on a number of academic, social, and childrearing measures. Conduct of the child significantly influenced parental expectancies on most measures.  Physical attractiveness was a factor in ratings on certain social factors and sex of the child seemed to bias ratings on vocational attainment. The results were discussed in terms of sociocultural expectancies. (Author)",

Subjects were randomly paired with confederates of low or high facial attractiveness who interacted with the subject in a cold-unfriendly or warm-friendly manner. The imitation task involved the confederate lighting a specified colored light on the subject's panel in response to a noun. The subject then indicated his color choice on the confederate's panel. The summed score for 20 trials of match or mismatch was used as the measure of imitation. Results indicated that physical attractiveness influences imitation when combined with other variables, but when compared with a salient, interpersonal attraction variable such as warmth, the  effects of physical attractiveness are greatly reduced. The data suggests that the effects of physical attractiveness may be substantially altered when subjects have an opportunity to interact with persons of differential attractiveness; thus, one needs to exercise caution in making inferences from the literature on physical attractiveness.

A counselor has a responsibility to educate himself about the history and culture of the Mexican-American and to take an active part in helping students resolve their identity crises.

Intimate relationships are characterized by revelation of one's innermost thoughts and feelings as well as one's physical body. The development of intimate relationships is creating new kinds of problems. For example, the shock caused be expressing previously unstated feelings to a spouse may lead to separation. The unexpected but honest answers of children create conflict between generations. Intimacy also provides opportunities for new kinds of experiences which can intensify and deepen relationships.  Counselors and educators need to adjust their concerns and assumptions to the reality of the new sufficiency.

Specifically, we have focused on Melvin Kohn's suggestive hypothesis that white collar parents stress the development of internal standards of conduct in their children and thus are more likely to discipline the child on the basis of their interpretation of the child's motives for a particular act, while blue collar parents are more likely to react on the basis of the consequences of the child's behavior. Our findings, based on a sample of 210 Washington State couples, support this hypothesis. We found a greater difference in the responses of white collar parents toward their child when he \"accidentally breaks something\" versus when he \"intentionally disobeys\" than  there was for blue collar parents. Other class and sex differences in parental response to the child were also explored. (Author)",

Subjects were randomly assigned to one of five groups: two structured therapy groups, two unstructured therapy groups, and a no-treatment control group. The Personal Orientation Inventory, the Adjective Check List, and a measure of self-ideal congruence were selected as the dependent variables. Results showed that marathon participants, when compared with the control subjects, became more interested in their obligations (i.e., &quot;Self-control&quot;) and made greater efforts to be more successful (i.e., &quot;Achievement). Because narcotic addicts have difficulty in impulse control and lack of persistence in working on their problems, it seems reasonable to assume that  the addicts who participated in the marathon groups experienced therapeutic change. The results of the comparison between the structured and unstructured treatment conditions did not produce any significant results. Highly positive verbal feedback was received from the marathon participants directly after the postmeasures were administered. (Author/PC)",

The review of the literature is organized into several categories: (1) hyperactive child syndrome, (2) the child's behavior, (3) treatment for the syndrome, and (4) the role of schools and school personnel. Suggestions pertaining to administration of drugs to treat hyperkinesis and to appropriate responses of school personnel are offered. The author concludes that hyperkinetic child syndrome is a complex condition whose problems persist long after the hyperactivity cases. Examples of these lingering problems are low self-esteem, despair, parental rejection, socially inappropriate behavior, and a bad reputation. The author suggests a team, consisting  of physician, parent, teacher, and siblings, organized to respond to these problems. Situations can be organized in the school, for example, to raise self-esteem, to alleviate despair and anger, and to provide attention to the hyperkinetic child for appropriate, socially-acceptable behavior.

One hundred twenty-seven students selected from grades 3-5 in two schools served as subjects. One school was designated as the experimental school, and subjects were taught cause and effect and direct description context clues using the teaching activities outlined in the Wisconsin Design's \"Teachers' Resource File: Comprehension.\" The other school served as the control and offered no special instruction in context clues. The period of instruction consisted of 10 school days. Significant differences were found favoring the experimental school. Through an analysis of variance on the experimental school only,  significant differences were found between grade levels and across all three grade levels. One implication was that certain instruction in context clues could begin at least by third grade--or perhaps sooner with material of appropriate difficulty. (WR)",

The six chapters in the document address key steps in the diffusion process: setting objectives for the diffusion effort, selecting sites where the packaged programs will succeed, getting information about these programs to potential users, finding out what sites need to implement the programs, supplying what the sites need when they need it, and evaluating the effectiveness of the diffusion effort. Each chapter summarizes field experience and literature on a specific step in the diffusion  process. This information comes from interviews and researchers who have introduced or studied educational change. Based on these experiences, implications for use of the Right to Read packages are listed at the end of each chapter to provide specifications for developing a sound diffusion strategy--whether for a field test of the packaged programs or for a limited dissemination effort.

To be eligible for participation in the program, the student must be a resident of New York City and reside in one of the designated poverty areas, must possess a high school diploma or its equivalent, and must not have attended college previously unless a veteran. Since these students are in need of remedial and supportive services, the SEEK Program was designed with three components to serve those needs: remedial and supportive instructional services, counseling services, and financial assistance. Because of the institution of the SEEK Program and  the Open Admission Policy, Bernard M. Baruch College of CUNY established the Department of Compensatory Programs in 1970. The department is responsible for providing remedial and supportive instructional services to any student who, by virtue of a a placement examination, requires these services to successfully meet degree requirements for graduation.

As expected, significant age differences in recall were found; analysis of rehearsal strategies showed that fifth and eighth graders tended to repeat stimulus words immediately after presentation and not to enter items into subsequent rehearsal sets. Adults, in contrast, tended to re-enter items for additional rehearsal and had larger rehearsal buffers. Immediate repetition may have served as additional massed presentation trials, which are less consequential for learning than later re-entry of items (spaced trials). It was inferred that children engaged primarily in maintenance rehearsal, and adults in both maintenance  and elaborative rehearsal. (Author)",

This helps to determine both common vocabulary and the problem issues around which the processes of reflection could develop. The second phase involves the selection of words from the common vocabulary. Three criteria govern this choice: the words should include the basic sounds of the language; the vocabulary, when organized, should enable the pupil to move from simple letters and sounds to more complex ones; and the words should be chosen for their potential capacity to confront the social, cultural, and political reality. The third phase of the method develops teaching materials of two types. One type is a set of cards or slides which  break down the words into parts for careful analysis. The second type is a set of cards of pictorial situations, related to the words, which are designed to impress on the pupils images of the words and also to stimulate his thinking about the situation that the word implies. The key to the successful implementation of the method is the coordinator, who does not teach but tries to promote self discovery in the other participants through exploring the dimensions of the pictures.

Subjects were 626 young adults enrolled in four Job Corps residential centers. R/EAL (Reading/Everyday Activities in Life), a new test of functional literacy, was administered to subjects under one of three conditions: English-taped, English-printed, or Spanish-taped. Results indicated that under each of the conditions, R/EAL proved to be a reliable and valid measure of literacy. Significant relationships were found between literacy performance and number of years of school  completed and between literacy and traditional reading for each condition. No significant relationships were found between sex or length of stay in program and literacy. Conclusions are that literacy measurement on practical reading tasks can be accomplished, that test administration conditions do not significantly affect test performance for groups at comparable reading levels, and that a number of factors appear to be associated with such measurement.

The study focused on the predictive accuracy of a developmental-neuropsychological test battery which was given to a total population of white boys during kindergarten (1970) in order to forecast their reading achievement in subsequent years. The predictive accuracy of the test battery was determined by assessing reading in this population at the end of grades one, two, and three. The results revealed that  performance on these tests during kindergarten was extremely predictive of the child's reading group membership in later grades, particularly with those children destined to become severely disabled or superior readers. These findings lend substantial support to the validity and utility of an early detection or warning system that could be administered economically before the child begins formal reading and at a time when he is less subject to the effects of academic failure.

Eighty first-grade and 84 second-grade children from a metropolitan school system served as subjects. Subjects in each grade were randomly assigned to each of four experimental conditions: picture-word, no picture-word, picture-sentence, and no picture-sentence. Test stimuli for all four conditions were identical. Four index cards each contained a single word, either \"cup,\"\"cat,\"\"bat,\" or \"bed,\" printed in an artificial alphabet. The procedure of testing consisted of a warm-up period, a training period, and a testing period, all completed at one sitting. Subjects were told to look at the word, put a finger under it, and state what the word was. No feedback was given on the test trials. The  results indicated that the word-alone treatment required significantly fewer trials to criterion. Furthermore, more correct responses were given with this treatment when compared with all other conditions. (WR)",

In the first experiment, second-grade children were exposed to 15 line drawings cross-classified to represent four taxonomic categories and four shape categories, with four instances per category. In the second experiment, first graders freely sorted the pictures and were classified as semantic or physical processors based on their predominant bases of sorting. Following exposure (experiment 1) or sorting (experiment 2), the subjects were asked to recall the picture names. Results of both experiments  showed that semantic activity yields greater recall than physical activity. The second experiment also showed that semantic activity yields greater semantic clustering in recall and that physical activity yields greater physical clustering. (Author/RB)",

Some of the conclusions were that in a large number of learning tasks children seem to learn better when the materials are presented in pictures than when the materials are presented in words; there appear to be limitations on the effectiveness of pictures in terms of both learner and task differences; subject-generated organizational strategies (visual imagery in particular) greatly facilitate associative learning; and the benefits from an imagery strategy have also been obtained on tasks  requiring comprehension of a passage.

What classroom experiences did teachers provide that were designed to improve students' reading skills? To evaluate the program the following questions were asked: What were the student outcomes? Did reading skills improve significantly? Which characteristics of the project are worthy of replication and which ones are to be avoided in similar programs? The results indicated that the general unity of staff effort and an increase in teachers' skills in the  teaching of reading were shown. In classes where the program was not operational, students did not show significant gains.

The evaluation process was concerned with surveying the reading methods, materials, and types of reading skills being used and/or developed in first through fifth grade. The instrument used was a questionnaire which was administered to teachers in 70 elementary schools and 14 fifth-year centers. The criteria for the instrument to evaluate the elementary reading program were based on the Oklahoma City School District's philosophy for the teaching of reading. Some of the results were: there may be  a strong relationship between the drop in achievement scores at the fourth-grade level and the fact that only half of the fourth-grade teachers felt it their responsibility to provide formal reading instruction; teachers voiced a desire for further inservice training; first- and fourth-year teachers were attempting to cover all the basal reading materials for their grade level each year; and teachers spent almost as much time planning for each day as they did on actual reading instruction.

Experiment 1 tested for immediate spatial order memory of letters by giving children four or six consonants and having them place the letters in the order in which they had appeared in a just-viewed stimulus. The consonants composing the strings were either positionally redundant (R) or nonredundant (NR) based on positional frequencies of letters in printed English. Poor readers were equal to good readers on four-letter strings, but inferior to good readers on both R and NR six-letter strings. Both reader groups were better in retrieving spatial order for R strings than for NR strings. Experiment 2 tested for immediate spatial order memory and immediate item memory for strings of eight digits and strings of eight consonants.  Good readers were better than poor readers on all tasks. Performance on digits was better than performance with litters in both the order and the recall tasks for the two groups. The importance to the reading process of the poor reader short-term memory deficit for spatial order information is discussed in terms of recent evidence that positional redundancy is used to augment visual feature information in the identification of single letters.

In most cases, CAI measures of progress were better indications of spring test performance than was the pretest given in the fall. Rates of progress in the parts or strands of the CAI program were highly correlated with each other, but certain strands proved to be better predictors of spring test scores than an overall rate measure. Regression models were developed to relate spring test scores to amount of time spent in CAI; results from these models were in accord with data from an earlier experimental study designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the CAI program. Using a stepwise regression, which  included both pretests and rates of progress in the strands, multiple correlations were obtained of .79 for the Cooperative Primary Test and .84 for the Metropolitan Achievement Test.

The display size of the second stimulus was one, two, and four letters. Reaction time was a linear function of display size. Response type (positive and negative) affected both the intercept and the slope of reaction time function. These results were explained by response bias and rechecking operations. Finally, the reaction time function for physical match was faster in intercept and slower in slope than for name match. Differential encoding processes and parallel matches were  suggested.

On each trial subjects were asked to memorize two, four, or six pictures and were then presented with a single picture probe. The subject made a key-pressing response to indicate whether the probe was in the memory set or not. Older subjects respond more rapidly than younger subjects in all conditions. The results strongly suggest that the memory sets are encoded visually and that the search for the probe is a high speed, exhaustive scan, although, due to difficulty of the task, the outcome is unclear for younger subjects at memory set size 6. The children are scanning memory for the presence or  absence of a picture at the rate of 17-20 pictures per second. (Author)",

The broadcast material was gathered in a series of interviews done especially for this paper. The data in this case study is presented in both narrative and table form and the extent to which Canadian newscasts follow the American format and content when they are recorded for rebroadcast is examined. This news policy is especially  significant when news is translated into French, but contains an American perspective on world events.

The in-class administered questionnaire answered by 23 volunteer subjects consisted of 15 sections concerning students' contacts with magazines and newspapers, their reading of books, their reading preferences and habits, and the books they owned; a take-home questionnaire gave the same students a chance to check the lists of books they remembered reading and owning. The second  portion of the study involved a two-week activities log on which 20 students recorded their participation in television and movie viewing; radio, record player, and tape player listening; newspaper, magazine or journal, and other kinds of reading; and classwork not involving reading. Results showed that data obtained from the log sheets were more reliable than data obtained from questionnaires. Included are 58 tables of findings and materials related to the two test instruments.

Students spend the remainder of the class time in discussing their writing.

It is true that children have been exposed to drama of some kind--there is intense interest in creative drama (especially on the part of educationists), there are anthologies of children's plays which range from mediocre to poor in literary quality, and there is a widespread practice of adapting literary works for juvenile theatre audiences. However, good drama must become part of children's literature because (1) it belongs there as an accepted literary genre; (2) teachers should be able to deal  with it critically and practically on all levels; and (3) an art form needs an active and viable body of criticism in order to grow in stature.

A 156-frame program was developed, including procedures for: eliciting free written expression to serve as subject matter for poems; writing initial poems to fit Haiku and Tanka forms; revision of poems based on author and reader analysis; writing poetry using a variety of poetic devices; writing to fit various rhyme, meter, and stanza forms; and revising for greater poetic effect. A procedural guide for the development of programed materials is outlined in 11 steps including specification of objectives, assessment of performance, determination of causes of performance deficiencies, design of  appropriate systems (instructional, guidance, feedback, incentive, management) to eliminate deficiencies, and validation of those systems. Developmental and validational testing resulted in significant changes in program design. Recommendations are made for further work including determination of multiple cutoff scores for predicting mastery in the program and use of the computer as an aid in poetic composition.

        "description":"Though a general study of transformational grammar does not improve writing ability, students can learn to use transformational operations which combine and reduce clauses to make better sentences. Since students already know intuitively how to do the operations, transformational theory in the classroom is largely limited to sentence-combining exercises and makes no use of detailed analytical procedures. This paper demonstrates the varying complexity of typical combining exercises and then discusses their actual classroom use. In two 11th grade high school English classes, the same assignments were given, but the experimental class received instruction in sentence combining while the control class was taught in the traditional manner. A comparison of the compositions written by  members of each class reveals a dramatic increase in syntactic fluency by the experimental group after only one semester of instruction. (Author)",

Three suggestions related to increasing the effectiveness of inservice and staff development programs are given: (1) inservice and staff sessions do not need to be limited to the needs expressed by the teachers involved, but should be based on these needs; (2) when supervisors are involved  in inservice sessions, the administrators who work with the teachers involved should be part of the group and be advised in advance of the specific plans for the session; and (3) plans should be made in advance for follow-through on inservice and staff development sessions.

The four media utilized are talk-tapes, visual-aid cards (minireproductions of the overhead transparencies), vocabulary cards for optional drills and personal reference, and a flexible course of study allowing for individualization. Each unit has its objective clearly outlined in behavioral terms; at the end of each lesson there is a comprehensive self-assessment task; and at the completion of each unit another quiz is provided which includes previous unit skills and/or concepts, along with the current unit  objectives. Students who have any problems with the exercises, tasks, or quiz are directed to reread the material and confer with the instructor for supplemental material. Criterion-referenced grading is used to measure each objective. Vocabulary study in the first semester is based on vocabulary drawn from social institutions such as home and family, business, government, and education, while the lessons in the second semester are drawn from terminology and essays concerned with law, medicine, geology, biology, and physics.

Over 135,000 words of natural language were examined and a range fixed expressions were isolated and placed into the categories of interjection, circumlocution, quantification, emphasis, and officialese. The research shows that first-language speakers use a fixed expression once in every five words, which results in a comfortable familiarity with their own language in everyday speech. It is concluded in this report that fixed expressions must be taught to second-language learners to give them further self-assurance when speaking English. (TS)",

The purpose of these surveys was to obtain information on classroom practices in the teaching of literature electives in high schools today. Some of the questions asked in the surveys were: Can you give the names of three elective courses in literature that are particulary  popular with today's students? Is it still important to cover American literature or British literature per se in the high schools? Do you feel a literature program should attempt to teach reading skills? Can you name any good literary selections which you feel all high school students should meet somewhere in literature courses?

In the past, when statistical researchers have found they cannot meet criteria, they have devised a new set of test characteristics. For example, when validity cannot be measured, researchers measure reliability, despite the fact that reliability is interesting only because it is a necessary component of validity. Mass communication research needs to acquire some new directions, including the development of a library of case studies on human communication behavior and the development of more sophisticated descriptive measures than sex, age, education, and so on. Finally, researchers in mass communication need to declare a moratorium on the uses of semantic differential,  Likert-type scales, adjective check lists, shocking devices, and other measurement instruments which so poorly reflect reality.

Three groups were formed, each group generally composed of 30% Anglo, 30% Black, and 30% Chicano. The educational backgrounds of the individuals in the groups ranged from high school freshman to masters degree level. The ages ranged from 14 years to 52 years, and there was generally an equal number of women and men. Isolation of the ethnic communications problems unique to each class was obtained by use of open-ended discussions. The groups then chose one of the problems and fit it into a role playing scenario context using five criteria: (1) identify the nature of the problem; (2)  identify the basic symbolic processes operating within the problem; (3) arrange the problem and its symbolic functions into a scenario; (4) create roles which could be enacted; and (5) use an ethnic aide in creating communication strategies. The resultant data indicate that role playing is effective in creating more understanding of the feelings and needs of the ethnic peoples involved in inter-ethnic communication problems. (TS)",

The alternative-justification theory of debate is based on the assumption that any given question under debate has a number of affirmative plans and separate justifications. By contrast, a basic historical tenet of intercollegiate debate is that since any issue has two sides, the most effective decision making occurs after both positions are stated, argued, and evaluated. Following a statement and a discussion of each of the six assumptions on which the alternative-justification approach is based, it is concluded that academic debate theory should change but that analytical  weaknesses in the alternative-justification case do not justify its addition to debate theory.

        "description":"This paper discusses some of the central issues involved in philosophizing about rhetoric by raising two primary questions within the context of three traditional branches of philosophy: ontology, axiology, and epistemology. The two questions raised are: What are dialectical tensions in a philosophy of rhetoric? and How does a person try to cope with them? By using a construct of dialectic involving choice but not resolution, an ontological tension concerns the construction of reality through the interaction of certainty and uncertainty. An axiological tension concerns the conflict between polar opposites (i.e., the value of control vs. the value of choice, the conflict between security and freedom). An epistemological tension involves determining what data is acceptable in  pursuing reliable knowledge. A construct of argument is proposed as a method for coping with dialectical tensions. Six characteristics of the construct are: an inferential leap from one belief to the adoption of a new one; a perceived rationale for the leap; a choice among two or more competing claims; a regulation of uncertainty; the risk of confronting one's peers with one's choices; and a frame of reference shared optimally by those who argue.

The conclusions reached in this study were that few aspects of campaign rhetoric have undergone such massive change in recent years as the process of audience analysis; comparatively little attention has been focused on the persuasive practices of local candidates; precinct by precinct breakdowns of voter statistics are an essential tool of audience analysis for local candidates; voter statistics are  not as helpful to major candidates who do not operate at the precinct level; issue polls are an essential tool for audience analysis for major candidates; and issue polls are not as helpful to local candidates, who rarely speak on national or statewide issues.

        "description":"This study was designed to test the effect of a director's expectation of a good or bad performance by his actors on the judged effectiveness of their performances. Thirty-two actors were randomly chosen from volunteers in an introductory course in communication theory at the University of Wyoming. The eight directors were students in an upper level directing class. Each student directed two scenes: one in which he was led to believe his actors would perform well and one in which he was led to believe his actors would perform poorly. With dialogue, rehearsal time, properties, and talent held constant throughout the study, each scene was videotaped and judged by a panel composed of theatre faculty and graduate students. The results indicate that the director's expectancies  affected the performances given by the actors in the direction of those expectancies. It may be possible, therefore, that a director's expectations of an actor's potential talent may itself be, in part, a determinant of that talent. (TS)",

The purpose of this study was to gather and analyze data to provide information about the speech programs that community colleges created or expanded as a result of the sharp increase in enrollment. Specifically, several aspects of community college speech programs were surveyed: departmental organization, role and function of the chairman, staff, courses, activities, and rationale for the speech program in a community college. Analysis of the data indicates that speech programs are well established as integral parts of community colleges with courses similar to those offered in the first two  years of four-year institutions. However, most of these speech programs do not include courses other than those parallel to university courses for students in occupational, continuing education, or remedial curricula. Colleges with 5,000 or more students outranked the smaller colleges in almost every area in which significant differences emerged. Other results and comprehensive recommendations are provided, along with complete statistical data. (TO)",

Program content was investigated utilizing content analysis methodology and coding all broadcasts into one of 11 categories: entertainment, news, public affairs, informational, religious, instructional, sports, political, children's, miscellaneous, and experimental art. Program content was determined from a questionnaire which each producer was required to complete when submitting programing for the access channels. The results of the  program analysis indicated that (1) there has been a steady increase in both the amount of air time and in the number of programs cablecast on the channels; (2) much of the programing was community oriented; (3) most of the programing tried to present material which was unavailable to the audience via broadcast television; and (4) the growth pattern for the initial two years suggests that the channels can be a viable medium for communication on a neighborhood level.

One of the primary objectives of advertising is to communicate truthfully. The laws of the Federal Trade Commission exist to protect the public from wrong and misleading information, but the greatest protection is the hard light of constant exposure. Because of advertising, magazines can be distributed more cheaply and widely, informing people of changes and improvements in their fields of business or interest. Advertising is responsible to the public and can be valuable only when the public makes known its needs. (TS)",

To support this thesis, the author reviews several contemporary approaches which have dealt with the enthymeme and develops an analysis of the essential requirements of dialectic and rhetoric which affect the characteristics of their respective syllogisms. The author predicts four essential characteristics of the enthymeme based on an assumption made by Aristotle that the rhetorical respondent, while untrained in the assessment of arguments, still has an innate understanding and preference for logical reasoning. The four  characteristics are: (1) it must be short, simple, and to the point; (2) to accomplish this, the rhetorician must make use of common knowledge and draw obvious conclusions; (3) since one is arguing from propositions with which the auditor is already familiar, the enthymeme may be stylistically modified; (4) this modified argument has greater persuasive impact than the arguments developed by the educated man.

Contents of broadcasts on 80 days, 20 each from the first and last quarters of the two years, were coded and analyzed. Results showed that the intensity of negative assertions was greater during 1968 and that those from China were more intense.

Subjects were drawn from private industry, the Civil Service Commission, and the Department of the Navy. In the second investigation, 40 scale items were drawn from the original item pool and submitted to subjects across four organizations: private industry, Civil Service Commission, Navy Department, and  retail outlets.

A conceptualization of proximity which attempts to deal with these problems for use in large organizations is developed in this paper. Proximity is defined as the probability of people being in the same location at the same point in time, that is, as an opportunity for face-to-face communication made possible by time and space. It is operationalized as a mean joint probability among all people in the organization. A computer program,  PROXVAL, which was developed to calculate the required quantities, is described.

Twenty instructors and 417 students, representing 20 class sections of the basic speech communication course at a midwestern university, served as subjects. Nine instructional objectives based on three assigned  chapters in the required textbook were investigated over a period of three weeks, using two instruments to test the hypotheses of the study. A content test was devised by the researcher to measure overall student achievement, and subscales of this test were used to measure achievement at different levels of cognitive learning. The results of this study supported the contention that behavioral objectives have a positive, facilitative effect on student achievement. (TS)",

        "description":"This study is a quantitative descriptive survey of the character and scope of Maine high school curricular and cocurricular theatre education. A two-part questionnaire was mailed to the principal and the teacher most directly concerned with programs in theatre of all Maine public and private high schools in the fall of 1972. Sixty-one percent of all Maine high schools responded. The most notable findings of the study are that most of the high schools responding (96 percent) put on plays and that half offer at least one specific course in theatre. In addition, it was discovered that no more than one fourth of the teachers now teaching and/or directing theatre programs have earned more than 12 college credit hours in theatre subjects and that 40 percent have had no formal  preparation in production-oriented courses. Notable findings of the comparison between the Maine profile and the national profile (by J.L. Peluso) are that teacher training is only slightly better throughout the nation, more specific courses are offered per school in Maine, attitudes of Maine principals are more favorable toward theatre programs, plays produced in Maine are financially more independent, and one-act plays in Maine and full-length plays in the nation are most popular.

More than simple coping with conflict, an administrator needs to know how to channel conflict toward constructive ends. Conflict theory is given primary attention in this paper in order to provide school administrators with a conceptual framework within which to analyze the conflict-laden events and situations that arise in daily administration. It is essential that administrators be apprised of the complex nature of conflict and of its underlying dynamics, so that they come to see opponents not as enemies but as fellow human beings subject to the same forces that they themselves are subject to.

Each section of the bibliography provides a working set of references for one of the five major areas of research in which network analysis has been used. The first section deals primarily with specifying the physical structure of networks. Theoretical work describing various relationships between nodes and arcs are listed as well as more empirical work that has utilized and extended this initial body of theory. The second section presents material dealing with the general problem of optimizing flows through a given network. The third section considers theoretical work that has been done to enumerate the total number of  possible graphs of a system, given a set of nodes and a set of arcs. The fourth section looks at applied studies that use the theory of graphs in an attempt to derive &quot;optimal&quot; networks. Finally, the last section presents a series of studies that deal with the problem of seeking optimal routes through a network. (Author/DN)",

It begins with a review of some relationships between the property tax and land use planning. Then, the role of the property tax as one of several devices employed in fiscally-oriented planning is examined. The third section surveys references providing a background to the real property tax exemption. The fourth section examines aspects of the property tax exemption debate, especially the notion that exemptions place a financial burden on the community.

Project teams developed educational specifications after citizens, students, teachers, and staff members were surveyed to gain their concerns and suggestions regarding the new schools. The teams continued to work with architects to see that the educational specifications were accurately represented in the architectural drawings. Environmental impact studies were made to assess the effect the new schools would have on the environment. By the end of 1974, the Board of  Education and the State had accepted the preliminary plans for the new schools. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"Many alternative schools established in the late 1960's and early 1970's eventually dissolved or became as traditional as their predecessors. This paper offers an organizational explanation of the failure of alternative schools. The author discusses criteria for identifying alternative schools and suggests a three-stage developmental model describing the school's progression from euphoria to psychic upheaval to dissatisfaction. The dissatisfaction stage evenutally results in one of three possible outcomes for an alternative school: dissolution, movement toward more traditional forms, or resolution of dissatisfactions and retention of the alternative character. Anecdotal evidence from two case studies is presented to support the developmental model. The author suggests that  successful alternative schools have developed a well-integrated and formalized, yet pluralistic and individualistic, structure capable of supporting a complex instructional program.

        "description":"This study examines the relationship of organizational variables to teacher motivation. It seeks to determine what differences, if any, exist between the organizational structures of multiunit (MUS) and non-multiunit (NMUS) individually guided education (IGE) elementary schools. The unit of analysis consists of MUS and NMUS elementary schools in the State of Wisconsin that employed ten or more staff members during 1971-72. Organizational structure was defined in terms of Hage's axiomatic theory of organizations. School means of complexity, centralization, formalization, and stratification were used, along with school size, to describe the organizational structure of the schools. Teacher motivation was defined in terms of the organization's reward systems as measured by expectancy  theory as delineated by Vroom and Porter and Lawler. Major findings indicate no significant differences between MUSs and NMUSs in school size, complexity, and formalization, but MUSs were less centralized, less stratified, and had more highly motivated teachers than NMUSs. Results of this study suggest that administrators interested in developing higher levels of teacher motivation should make every effort to involve teachers in the decisionmaking process and that they should attempt to distribute rewards to teachers fairly and justly.

An effort was made, first, to determine if community resources were available, sufficiently sophisticated, and receptive to provide meaningful exploratory experiences related to careers and, second, to determine to what extent, if any, positive career exploration experience could widen horizons and develop and enhance positive attitudes toward the world of work in eighth grade students. A model plan was developed and field  tested; community agencies were responsive and demonstrated expertise in providing exploratory experiences for students; and an analysis of the pre- and post-attitudinal survey and tests revealed that the experience did widen horizons and develop and enhance positive attitudes toward the world of work in the participants.

        "description":"The Institute for Responsive Education and its study team are looking at ways to widen the scope of collective bargaining to provide room for communities to participate in policy formulation in their schools. The traditional management-labor approach was designed to resolve differences about wages, fringe benefits, and the rules, rights, and responsibilities of employers and employees, not to resolve differences about the rights of children, parents, and taxpayers involved in the educational process. As more and more educational decisions are made in bilateral, behind-closed-door negotiations, there will be even less opportunity for constructive ideas from students, parents, and others in the community than there are now. Furthermore, collective bargaining seems to be moving  toward greater centralization in large school districts, making it even more difficult for the people concerned about an individual school--teachers, staff, parents, students, and community residents--to be adequately represented. We need to break out of the confines of the narrow, bilateral approaches to educational decisionmaking in general, and the closed-door collective bargaining patterns in particular. (Author/WM)",

The program is now in its third year of operation. The program was instituted to help broaden the scope of the curriculum, to give students and teachers more time for preparation and interaction, to give students greater opportunity for decisionmaking, and to allow teachers to experiment with new teaching techniques. Under the program the number of course offerings increased from approximately 100 to approximately 250, and resource centers for students and teachers have been  created.

Often, yesterday's top priorities are suddenly replaced by others more relevant to constantly shifting educational demands. In order to manage school improvements, administrators face the continuous need for acquiring new abilities. To perpetuate effective leadership a school district must provide a program whereby each of its administrators has an opportunity to participate in an individualized and continuous program of self-renewal. This paper reports the results of an individualized continuing education, and school climate improvement program for school administrators. It is addressed to superintendents, principals, area superintendents,  coordinators, assistant superintendents, and others interested in self-, and school improvement processes. It is also designed for school administrators responsible for developing inservice education or administrative renewal programs for school district leadership personnel. (Author/WM)",

A packaged computer program was used to analyze the data and calculate chi-square and lambda measures. Results of the study showed that education association presidents favored enactment of a collective negotiations statute in Kentucky, while a strong majority of school board chairmen opposed such legislation.

        "description":"This study probes the influences behind recent trends in State-local finance and attempts to ferret out the dominant influences that will prevail during the remainder of the seventies. It presents projections of State-local finance for fiscal years 1975 and 1980 that indicate general spending and revenues will grow at a pace that will tend to generate surpluses of some $13 billion in 1975 and $9 billion in 1980. The major element tending to mitigate the rise in spending is the expected leveling in enrollments in educational institutions and in the number of welfare recipients. The outlook for a somewhat higher rate of inflation in the seventies than in the sixties tends to narrow the full savings that might otherwise result. The publication suggests that the ability of States and  localities to achieve a lasting state of financial balance is predicated on policy decisions on how potential surpluses will be used, future federal policy with respect to grant-in-aid programs, the manner in which the current controversy over local public school finance is resolved, and the willingness of State-local units to cut back from recent accelerated rates of expenditure growth to increases that are more in line with longer-term averages.

The trimester schedule divides the regular school year into three equal 60 day periods. The option of a summer quarter can be added as the need arises. Under the plan, school periods are 70 minutes long in the junior high school and 80 minutes long in the high schools. Class periods are divided into smaller blocks of time to better accomodate new teaching methods within a class. The program also utilizes some team teaching, open space classrooms, and resource labs. The trimester plan enables students to concentrate on fewer courses at a given time and to have more school resources available. It also allows students who do not make adequate progress the opportunity to catch  up within the school year without any loss of normal course offerings. The schedule gives teachers a longer planning period, the opportunity to teach more in their fields of interest, increased student contact, and the opportunity to work with each student in his prime learning time of day.

The school is a campus arrangement, and each house is a separate building.

The report also provides a comparison of reported uses since the January 1, 1972 initiation of the GRS program. Findings indicate that more than $6.7 billion of GRS funds were spent by States and recipient local governments during the 1974 fiscal year. It is estimated that this figure represents approximately 3 percent of the total expenditures of these governments during the same period. An analysis of the reported actual uses of general revenue sharing during the 1973-74 period reveals the following major uses of GRS monies by States and local governments: public safety services, 23 percent; educational services and  facilities, 21 percent; public transportation, 15 percent; and multipurpose and general government, 10 percent. Sixty percent of the States were able to reduce taxes by virtue of GRS funds, and 20 percent were able to prevent new taxes. At the local level, 35 percent reported GRS receipts had enabled them to prevent new taxes while 34 percent reported local taxes had been kept at prior levels. (Author/DN)",

The study is based on data from five questionnaires distributed to a selected national sample of over 2,000 unit teachers, unit leaders, principals, district coordinators, and superintendents in multiunit schools and school districts. Factor analysis was used to identify those change variables that clustered together to form distinct factors affecting institutionalization. The key variables identified related to open and supportive environments, user attitudes, user's  cost-benefit decision, the use of open communication channels, supportive services and resources, and flexibility of the change process. Item and multiple regression analysis were used together to identify those global change variables that directly related to the institutionalization of MUS-E. Important variables of change were: the perceived relative advantage, observability, and simplicity of MUS-E; the degree to which the individual was informed, involved, and supported in the change process; the way and degree to which the individual communicated with others; and the way and degree to which the school organization was complex and less formalized.

Recent widespread unrest among students suggests the need to thoroughly re-evaluate the twelfth grade program in order to investigate the causes for the unrest and to suggest workable alternatives capable of alleviating the problems that plague twelfth grade programs today. This limited study has produced three conclusions regarding twelfth grade unrest: (1) the problems are both serious and widespread, (2) the complexity of the problems prevents the identification of single causes and solutions, and (3) secondary school principals are acutely aware of the need for change and for rigorous questioning of the high school  program. Alternatives to the traditional high school program are being developed all across the country. While some districts are forming alternative schools and attempting major restructuring efforts, other districts are developing promising programs within the basic framework of the traditional school.

Under the direction of the teacher, who acts as an advisor, each student works at his or her own pace through various sequences in each of nine areas of learning. If students and their teacher-advisors are to know where everyone stands in such a system, sophisticated monitoring systems are in order. The Pius X solution was to use the money previously spent on computerized scheduling to monitor student progress. Teacher-advisors working with students themselves assumed responsibility for  scheduling while the computer took over the progress-monitoring function. (Author/WM)",

The report is both a summary and an update of information contained in four earlier studies that analyzed the economics of education in Massachusetts and the State's new equalizing education aid formula. The report recommends that the State adopt an unrestricted percentage equalizing plan coupled with a new program of local educational accounting. It suggests that since education is a State responsibility, at least 50 percent of school funding should come from State-levied resources, but not to the exclusion of substantial local support or without the expectation of a large Federal contribution in the future. The report also suggests that the method of State funding should itself contribute  to the development of local initiative and public participation. (Author/DN)",

The study also considers school transportation in Indiana, school facilities funding, fiscal ability and effort of Indiana school corporations, and compensatory education programs. Problems with Indiana's current school finance program are varied and complex: the basic formula for State aid has not been revised for several years; the recently enacted supplemental grant to aid low assessed valuation districts is very limited; special education and vocational education need sharp increases in funding if equal opportunity is to be provided; and the impact of inflation and the State-imposed levy freeze, coupled with the  demand for additional or expanded educational programs, negate traditional school finance reform problem-solving approaches in searching for constructive alternatives. The study recommends a program that would not reduce funds for the high spending districts but would provide increased funds to the low spending districts. The study recommendations suggest a State school support program that will recognize the variations in educational needs among school corporations and at the same time will provide sufficient funds for each pupil in the State.

At this turning point in education, planning must contribute to needed mutation and reform. Vector planning seems likely to supplement target planning as a means of identifying and programing needed reorientations and as a means of helping to learn experientially through feedback. Target planning is programing of activities to meet specified quantitative levels at specified times. Vector planning is the art of designing educational programs and innovations oriented toward desired directions of improvement and of incorporating feedback for correcting activities and, if necessary, goal structures. Planners have to  accept responsibility for their potential political role; they must help in the formation of coalitions of clients, implementers, and beneficiaries to adopt and propagate innovations along desirable vectors. The technique of simulation may assist in vector planning and in broadening participation in it. (Author/DN)",

Examined is a mobile van program in which the employment potentials of tenth grade special education students in Baltimore, Maryland, are assessed by means of psychometric tests, work samples, and observation of work behavior. Also noted is Project SERVE in St. Paul, Minnesota, in which approximately 437 educable mentally handicapped students (grades 10-12) spend half of each day either at the school or in community-based job  training programs. Project Worker of Fullerton, California, is characterized as a program in which teenaged job seekers learn to locate jobs and interview, develop job skills, and train in settings both on and off campus. The Technical Vocational Program for Deaf Students is reported to include a 12-week preparatory program designed to help postsecondary deaf students in social, vocational, and academic adjustment as well as courses in industrial, technical, business, distributive, health, and service areas. The Vocational Village of Portland, Oregon, is said to offer personalized career education to young persons (14 to 21 years old) who have dropped out of high school, been referred by penal institutions and the courts, or transferred from regular high schools due to physical, mental,  or emotional problems.

In the two phases of the first study, a battery of screening tests was evaluated with a total of approximately 8,400 elementary grade children. Results led to the recommendation of the LD Screen-Pupil Behavior and LD Screen-Syllabication instruments as efficient screening tests. In the second study, on intervention models, the effectiveness with 210 LD children in 18 classrooms of the following three models was compared: Alphabetic, Phonetic, Structured Linguistic (APSL); Programed Instruction; and Individually Prescribed  Program. Results indicated that the APSL approach was slightly more effective with low achieving students and that students in all three programs had positive attitudes. In the final study, a performance based staff development program was evaluated with 14 resource teachers and three regular teachers. Results showed that LD children taught by the teachers in the experimental staff development program demonstrated higher academic achievement and more positive attitudes than students of teachers in the control group.

Findings and recommendations of a previous conference (West Point, 1970) are noted. Common themes of conference papers are given such as the need for change in the procedures used to prepare teachers in COHI programs and the need for procedures based on well defined behavioral objectives. The four-step process used by the conferees in developing behavioral objectives is described, applied to two competencies, and evaluated. Detailed are 27 objectives and performance criteria developed by conference work groups for training teachers in the areas of assessment, instructional approaches, and  coordination of services. A 3-year plan for improving teacher education through the identification of teacher competencies with behavioral objectives is outlined from phase 1 (describing competencies) to phase 5 (implementation in regular classrooms). Listed are nine final conference recommendations such as the need for review of competencies by state and regional panels. Four general session presentations (covering topics such as implementation and evaluation of competency-based models), a list of institute personnel, and a brief explanation of the working format of the institute are appended.

Ss showed strengths in such skill areas as mobility, self-care, and personal adjustment while weaknesses were usually in specific abilities including shopping, reading, and the use of money. Identified were the following needs: systematic analysis and  development of local small group homes, coordinated planning between home and public school with greater emphasis on instructional carryover into adulthood, increased parent education, and augmented day care services.

There were three main goals: (1) to compare two different amplification systems to determine if the addition of frequencies in the 20 to 200 hertz range could facilitate the acquisition of speech perception and speech production skills in young deaf children; (2) to evaluate if severely impaired children could be trained auditorily by using aural/oral procedures such as the Verbo-tonal method; and (3) to evaluate filtered-speech testing for young deaf children. There was no significant difference between the speech reception/production scores  of the two groups. Both groups showed significant improvement, indicating that the verbo-tonal method was effective in the auditory training of severely hearing-impaired children. The filtered speech testing produced similar detection thresholds to those of pure-tone audiometry.

Administered was the Equilateral Triangle Test Battery, with subtests measuring concrete, identity, and classificatory concept attainment. Analysis of test scores indicated the following findings: (1) as hypothesized, boys of higher mental age  performed better than boys with lower mental age; (2) as hypothesized, there was no significant difference in the mean scores of the educable retardates and normal Ss; (3) the hypothesized treatment effect was found only for the vocabulary measure of the formal level subtest; and (4) the normal boys performed at the classificatory level while the retardates did not.

        "description":"Presented are reports of individual site visits and results of questionnaires describing nine child abuse and child neglect health-based programs located in Chicago, Denver, El Paso, Honolulu, Iowa City, Los Angeles, New York, Pittsburgh, and St. Paul. Included is information on funding, patient statistics, composition of teams, patient flow, cost of care, community resources, and treatment and rehabilitation services. Among similarities noted among programs are that all use a multidisciplinary approach, all offer medical and surgical care, and most have written guidelines for diagnosis and procedure. Also pointed out are areas of difference among programs such as in the pattern of intake sources, the role of nurses, and relationships with the legal profession. Summarized are  overall impressions and conclusions of site visitors such as that a child abuse team cannot deal effectively with a community larger than half a million people and that major federal investments are needed in child abuse treatment and prevention.

        "description":"Telecommunications devices for the deaf were evaluated in social communications, business uses, and educational and general data systems uses. Approximately 80 TV Phones placed in the homes of deaf adults were evaluated in such areas as equipment utility and reliability, and user reaction, through collection instruments such as user questionnaires and electronic devices for recording cumulative time for calls. Business installation of the TV Phone was done at a Montgomery Ward's Catalog Sales Office and use by approximately 412 deaf persons in the area who were informed of the service was evaluated. Exploratory applications of the communications equipment in educational/systems utilization was done through the media departments of two schools for the deaf, and a university  instructional technology department which examined its use as an on-line computer terminal for handicapped individuals confined to home. Users in the social setting reported advantages of the TV Phone such as compactness and portability and disadvantages such as the lack of hard paper copies of conversations (which TTYs provide). Utilization of the telephone catalog ordering service increased during the study period from approximately 3 orders per week to 8 to 12 orders per week. Educational uses for the TV Phone identified included continuing educational programing for deaf adults. (LS)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to obtain quantitative nonevaluative data about verbal behavior used by instructor and students in the foreign language classroom. Two beginner and two intermediate German classes were tape-recorded for two weeks, then coded according to patterns. Frequencies of various verbal behavior patterns were analyzed. A reduction process was applied, resulting in patterns which were the basis for further analysis. The main conclusion is that instructor and student classroom utterances can be called \"verbal behavior\" because they can be grouped into recurring patterns, the basic pattern being the initiate-respond-evaluate cycle. Observation categories and results of the statistical analyses are appended. (AM)",

        "description":"This publication is the result of a conference on foreign language teaching and European studies convened by the Centre for Information on Language Teaching and Research in February 1973. In the first chapter, which serves as an introduction to the volume, G. E. Perren summarizes current views about the relationship between foreign languages and European studies. In chapter 2 P. Freeman points out that European studies should more properly be called language area studies. The third chapter is divided into two parts. E. J. Neather supports the idea that the area studies curriculum is incomplete without a language element, and P. Whittington describes European studies courses at several British schools. Nonspecialist European studies programs in the sixth form are discussed by P.  Richardson in chapter 4. M. Brown writes about the Mill Hill French geography/history scheme in the fifth chapter, and German studies for the less able are recommended by A. F. Boxford in chapter 6. The seventh chapter treats the rationale behind area studies in the Schools Council Modern Language Project. T. Sirevag compares the educational role of foreign languages in Britain and Norway, and C. V. James presents six models of interrelationships between teaching languages and associated studies. Two papers prepared for but not discussed at the conference are printed as appendixes. (PMP)",
