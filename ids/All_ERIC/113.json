        "description":"In an effort to evaluate the effectiveness of the Georgia Life Skills for Mental Health Leader's Guides, a panel of 13 teachers who had used the materials was assembled. The panel members filled out extensive questionnaires assessing the educational value, communicability, motivational value, utility and format of the Guides, whose purpose is to help children from 5 to 18 cope with stress, handle major life decisions, and form more satisfying interpersonal relationships. In general, teacher's responses indicated that the Guides were very valuable as teaching instruments. Some of their suggestions for improvement were incorporating the Guides into a teacher training workshop; giving them a key topic index; and expanding the activities to include more appropriate ones for  kindergarten and first grade. The complete set of evaluative materials used, including tabulated results, comprises the bulk of the document. (Author/BP)",

        "description":"The newly-emerging phenomenon of dual-career marriages was investigated using four major life roles--Professional, Spouse, Parent, and Self as Self-Actualized Person. Six scales were constructed to measure potential conflict in areas represented by specific pairs of these roles (e.g., the area of Professional versus Parent). One major purpose of the study was to compare the degree of reported stress in these areas of potential interrole conflict. In addition to the prediction of gender differences, greater role conflict was anticipated for professional couples who are parents, in comparison to those who are not. Given the demanding nature of the Parent and Professional roles, higher stress was also expected in role-conflict areas involving these roles. Other purposes were to  investigate the correlates of role conflict, particularly in women who are members of dual-career marriages, and to investigate the influence of parenthood. The prediction of gender differences in regard to areas and correlates of interrole conflict was not supported, except for level of career aspiration, where high aspirations were negatively related to role conflict for men but positively related to role conflict for women. Strikingly different patterns of conflict, however, were found as a function of the presence or absence of children. (Author)",

        "description":"Promoting women into higher level organizational positions is vital as a social issue and a subject for organizational theory and research. Recently, Henning and Jardin have identified an internal factor that poses a problem to women and their job-related aspirations. The absence of long-term career commitment has been found to inhibit the sucessful transition from supervisory to managerial positions for women. Also, in contrast to men who see problems of upward job mobility as centering on people around them, women perceive them as centered on themselves. Women's inward preoccupation dulls their ability to assess other people objectively. As a result, they find it difficult to move from the role of supervisor-specialist to that of manager-generalist.

Utilizing sex, socioeconomic status and locus of control as independent variables, a significant interaction between sex and type of achievement was noted.

This point is questioned, and the posit that scientific knowledge does not answer the question of what makes a person either female or male is explored. Biological, psychological, and sociological differences overlap genders, and the inconsistencies are discussed. The biological attempts at differentiation of sex are unsuccessful, whether through hormones, chromosomes, sexual organs, or whatever. The constancy of gender identity is evident in the discussion of transexualism. The example of biological attribution of gender is considered, while the \"ultimate\" criteria remains elusive. Gender, in all of its  manifestations, including the physical, must be seen as a social construction. (LS)",

A sample of 300 older men and women in community settings provides an alternative perspective. For a number of daily living activities as well as personal and interpersonal attitudes and orientations, comparisons between older adults currently living with spouse and those alone make it apparent that sex of the subject importantly affects outcome. For older women in the lone status, life is far from unpleasant--in fact, they fare better not only than their single male counterparts but also than still-coupled women of comparable age. For men, on the other hand, the stereotypic views seem to have more  substance. Results are interpreted in the light of previous history of traditional role enactment and its differential impact during aging for men and women. (Author)",

        "author":["Anderson, Elaine A."],
        "description":"The rise in the American divorce rate since the early 1960's emphasizes the need to examine the factors associated with adjustment to marital separation. The impact of the legal system upon post-separation adjustment in Pennsylvania, which has adversary divorce statutes, is explored with 205 individuals, separated 26 months or less. Satisfaction with the legal system is significantly greater when either the reported relationship between the lawyer and the separated individual or the reported feelings toward the decisions in the settlement problems index, the economic issues, are more positive. Those respondents most highly satisfied with the legal system were more likely to report better adjustment to the separation if they had not been encouraged by the lawyer to create an  adversary relationship with their former spouse than if they had been encouraged to create an adversary relationship. Also, the fewer the number of instrumental functions, such as child issues, with which the respondent is involved, the better the reported adjustment to the separation. Divorce statutes based on an adversary model encourage collusion and do not enhance adjustment to a new life situation. Therefore, the present adversary divorce statutes may not reflect the current custody, economic, or property issues of marriage and divorce. (Author)",

The sample (N=580) was stratified by sex, household status (living alone or with spouse), and age, employing three age groupings: 25-34 (young), 65-74 (younger-old), and 75 and up (older-old). Paired similarity comparisons, attribute ratings, and preference rankings of products were obtained, as well as reactions to the decision task.

The focus is on how officers make their decisions--whether they handle such requests themselves, direct them elsewhere in the department, or refer citizens to other agencies. In their assessment of the literature on referral practices, the authors point out the major hypotheses that recur, and the data that supports or contradicts those theories. Their evaluation of the literature highlights several key issues: the clarity and consistency of definitions of police referral, the lack of theoretical constructs and empirical data, and the inadequacy of evaluative criteria. In addition to tracing the history of the police role in providing social services or referring citizens to appropriate  agencies, the report also offers suggestions for future research in this area. Also included are abstracts of 80 articles on the subject of referral practices, and a 32-page bibliography. (Author)",

Maintaining that there is an important function for such interactions in learning to read, the paper analyzes one learning process in these interactions--attention to errors--and argues that in oral reading instruction, attention to errors will function along with attention to appropriate reading responses. An analysis of error attention in terms of direct and indirect influences is then presented, with specific emphasis on the timing of attention, a strong determinant of self-behavior and accuracy. The paper concludes with the comment that it not only matters that early and remedial readers have one-to-one interactions, but it also matters how these interactions are  conducted. (FL)",

No longer can the developed and underdeveloped worlds relate as mentor and learner; the United States has much to learn from the great work in literacy and basic education performed in lesser developed areas. Mass literacy is necessary for modern technology and modern nations; the quest for universal literacy is inextricably linked to such values as equality of social and economic opportunity, self-determination in the political sphere, and the development of a critical intellectual spirit. In addition to functional or basic literacy, there exists the concept of \"social literacy,\" which recognizes that certain skills and capacities are  necessary for one to become a part of society and to transcend one's own heritage and gain some sense of oneself as a citizen of the world. Beyond the transmission of technical information and insight, literacy has a purpose in expressing the interpretations of human experience. (DF)",

        "description":"To determine reasons for the difficulties reading disabled boys commonly have with memory tasks, an investigation of the use of category organization in free recall of such children was undertaken. The performance of 45 nine- to eleven-year-old normal and 45 reading disabled boys was compared on a free recall task in which stimulus items were arranged in a fixed order for presentation prior to recall. Subsequently, subjects experienced one of three manipulations, all involving the active sorting of the materials. Two of these manipulations attempted through instructions to affect the child's level of processing of items, while the third allowed the child to sort freely in preparation for recall. Poor readers recalled fewer items and tended to show less organization of recall than  normal children during the baseline trial. On the experimental trial, recall and category clustering were highest for both groups following a manipulation designed to produce semantic encoding and grouping of items, and lowest when the children were required to focus on the color of the items. In the absence of instructions to guide the nature of their sorting of items for study, the reading disabled children failed to organize or study as effectively as normal readers did. Rather than lacking the ability to use semantic relations as a strategy for grouping items, the reading disabled children had difficulty in spontaneously generating an effective grouping strategy to aid recall.

In all story variations, the semantic content of the information was held constant. All children completed three tasks: a moral judgment concerning the goodness or badness of the protagonist's behavior, recall of the entire story, and a series of probe questions about the story events. The results indicated that information related to motives was recalled equally well independently of where it occurred in the story or in what category it was placed. Similar results were found when moral judgment scores were analyzed. The form or location of information did not alter moral evaluations.  The data suggest that prior findings on differential recall of story categories depend on uncontrolled content and the relation among statements to the main goal rather than the form or location of the category.

Four points are discussed as especially relevant to children's problems in reading comprehension: (1) reading differs from early language experiences, and an analysis of these differences can indicate likely sources of reading difficulty; (2) reading is a process that involves constructing hypotheses based on prior knowledge, while a lack of such knowledge can lead to incorrect hypotheses; (3) the emphases on decoding skills in early grades often engages children in essentially meaningless reading activities, giving the impression that reading has no purpose; and (4) an entirely new set of strategic skills is needed for functional reading tasks such as reading textbooks  or following instructions, tasks for which no foundation has been laid. Implications for testing are discussed, including the use of an individualized approach that embeds testing in the ongoing reading and writing activities in which the student is engaged. (DF)",

Excerpts from one of the written passages and excerpts and analysis of one teacher's presentation suggest four general advantages that teachers have over textbooks in getting children to understand and remember the material presented: they can tailor their messages to the background and level of understanding of the children in their classes; they can remind students of relevant information they already know and help them to see how new information is related to prior knowledge; they can focus students' attention  on a passage as a whole or on selected parts of a passage; and they can monitor comprehension. The results of the study point to ways that textbook authors may modify written passages so as to minimize their limitations, as well as to ways that teachers can optimize their classroom presentations and their reading comprehension instruction.

The four language functions are eliciting, informing, directing, and boundary marking (marking the divisions of discourse units). The three language sequences are moves (the basic units of classroom language, including opening, answer, and followup), exchanges (related moves taken in turns), and transactions (strings of exchanges). Data that examine these functions and sequences were collected for 11 beginning English teachers by coding the audiotapes of three classes per teacher. The patterns observed in these tapes suggest that the training of English teachers should contain a middle  ground between the behavioralist approach that argues for microscopic modifications of teaching behaviors (because they correlate with affective or cognitive outcomes) and a gestalt approach that advocates a generalized student attitude as the goal of a holistic approach to teaching.

Interaction has recently occurred between the two disciplines in \"poetics,\"\"structuralism,\" and the study of \"story grammars.\" Discourse analysis can be useful in literary study, particularly in the analysis of literature's mostly unconscious \"codes,\" the aspect of literature studied by the new \"poetics.\" Discourse analysis delineates the structural elements and the relationships between them in various types of discourse. To judge the validity of a given discourse analysis theory, a discourse must be seen as a  reaction to human experience, and analysis of discourse should be an attempt to explain the relationship between the discourse and the experience. The relationship is part of the continuum between actual world, experience, discourse, and analysis. As an application to the teaching of literature, a useful method might be one in which the teacher begins with showing the structure of \"simple stories\" and builds to more sophisticated texts, isolating elements to be taught.

Similarly, the college students usually received the same score regardless of the scale  used, while the professionals received consistently higher analytic ratings. The main difference between the two groups' writing styles seemed to be \"register,\" in that students did school writing for a grade by the teacher, and the professionals were not concerned about grades and wrote in a world writing register, aiming at a diverse audience.

The teacher wants the students to conceive of a writer as a process within a process engaging in a process. A metaphor that helps define the role a teacher can play to achieve that is Teacher-as-Artist who deliberately creates disorder by disorienting the audience. However, teaching within that metaphor is likely to create considerable anxiety among students. This anxiety can be reduced by making the classroom into a  playground where students can rehearse failure in a protected situation. Some techniques to help create this atmosphere include using group work as much as possible, stopping the use of syllabi, digressing a great deal, avoiding the assignment of one-shot papers, reading student journals and asking questions that lead to another entry, and assigning papers that grow out of each other.

Unknown today, Dodge wrote on politics, religion, and contemporary issues for newspapers and magazines and commented prolifically on the role of women in society. After feminist leanings as a young woman, she became increasingly conservative as she grew older. Her most celebrated articles appeared in the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; in 1877 and 1878 and attacked the efforts at civil service reform attempted under the administration of President Rutherford B. Hayes. Throughout her 40-year career, Dodge insisted on writing under the pseudonym, &quot;Gail Hamilton.&quot; Dividing her life into two totally different spheres, she  remained &quot;Abby&quot; to her family and refused to acknowledge in public that she was also &quot;Gail,&quot; the famous literary figure. Well-known as a brilliant and witty conversationalist, she had wide-ranging contacts in literary and political circles. Her career illustrates that an able woman could carve a place for herself in Victorian journalism, but it also illuminates the self-doubts and insecurities of a woman trying to function in a man's occupation.

Since students participate in a great deal of television viewing, it is as important for them to learn critical viewing skills as it is for them to learn critical reading skills. Teachers can mesh lessons in literary appreciation and visual literacy through examining how authors create characters, actions, and descriptions. As has been illustrated by author Richard Peck, students can examine adolescent novels in the light of considerations that might be made in filming them. In novels such as those of Paul Zindel, chapters can be  analyzed in terms of camera shots, images, and scenes. Filmed versions of novels can be compared with students' prior envisioning of filmed versions of those books. Teachers can also help students to explore the film technique of montage and to consider such topics as the cinematic qualities of the dialogue and opening scenes of Zindel's novels. (GT)",

Behind the myths are varied, complex, and flexible community colleges. The university English department can be responsible to the community college English department by keeping the lines of communication open, by having training and internship programs for future community college  English teachers, by initiating an exchange program for the faculties, and by offering course work and inservice workshops for community college instructors. The community college can assist the university by sharing its expertise on how to help the \"new student\" who is almost solely career oriented and how to cope with the problem of motivation for such new students.

The English department should provide models of effective techniques for conducting a composition program for other departments to emulate in modified form; these techniques include the following: have every student write several pages each week,  either a new project or a revision of an earlier draft; have all students complete designated exercises in prewriting, drafting, shaping, and revising; direct students to duplicate preliminary drafts to share in small peer groups and sometimes with the instructor; and have students submit two essays at midterm for evaluation as finished products. The use of peer review procedures of early drafts of writing assignments is recommended to appeal to busy colleagues in other disciplines. (DF)",

Audience research is also discussed. Research results indicate the following:  national minority public broadcast programing is seriously deficient, minority programing being disproportionately scarce; and the scarcity of minority programs is directly attributable to the insufficient number of minority persons employed in public broadcasting, controlling stations with public broadcast licenses, or having access to traditional sources of funding support.

        "description":"The development of a sound theory of the arguing of policy questions in debate requires that the Affirmative be obligated to demonstrate the solvency of its plan, regardless of the paradigmatic origins of the case theory. While the specific degree of demonstration which is necessary to establish solvency remains a substantive issue within the context of a given round, the basis of such an obligation remains constant. The advocate of change in a proposition of policy has the responsibility to demonstrate that the effects claimed from the proposition are correlated to specific mechanisms within the plan. The prediction of alleged effects is a burden of affirmation, and need not follow from the failure of negation. Ultimately, the adequacy of a proposition is not measured in terms  of the effects claimed, but rather through the probability of the effects' occurrence; an explicit obligation exists on the part of the Affirmative to prove that the plan does in fact remedy the problem. The theoretical requirement for an advocate to predict the consequences of a proposition is best measured in practice by the correspondence between inherency dysfunctions which preclude status quo action with plan mechanisms which address these dysfunctions.

        "description":"The &quot;logos&quot; concept of Martin Heidegger's phenomenological philosophy refers to a perceptual attunement to &quot;Being,&quot; or reality as a whole, which is prior to language. Logos includes every way in which people interpret, constitute, and interact with their world. Language is seen as prior to our awareness of Being, as well as constitutive of it. Logos, language, and speech have a teleological meaning aside from their function in communication; they are the means by which we create a personal world in which we dwell. An implication of Heidegger's philosophy for a theory of intrapersonal communication emerges in the view of truth as &quot;aletheia,&quot; or the uncovering or disclosing of the world to the individual, rather than as a correspondence to reality. &quot;My truth&quot; is the result of the  way the world has disclosed itself to me; no one is &quot;wrong.&quot; A second implication arises from Heidegger's stress on language as constitutive of individual perception. Language is not merely a tool, it is a major influence on the way we perceive our world; perhaps by altering or expanding the equipment which the individual uses to shape his or her perception, the very nature of that perception might be changed.

Hymes. These speech events occur when someone seeks information from another for a formal purpose. The study analyzed one speech act within each speech event for each of two participants in a job-related legal controversy. Following Hymes' methodology, the following components of the speech acts were identified: situation, or setting and scene; participants; ends in view; act sequence, or message form and content; key, or tone; instrumentalities, or channels and forms of speech; norms of interaction and interpretation; and genres. Results indicated that once a speech act has  been identified as belonging to the &quot;giving testimony&quot; genre, all other speech act components can be predicted. Similarly, once a speech act has been identified as a member of the &quot;being interviewed&quot; genre, all components, with the exception of setting, can be predicted. The findings suggest that Hymes' methodology neglects the relationship of the speaker to the content of the speech act--a component that influences speech act form. (DF)",

The results showed the following: students believed in the existence of a \"correct grammar\"; most students had been exposed to grammar drill in secondary school; most believed that good grammar was a mark of an educated person; most felt that constant monitoring of one's language leads to self-consciousness; many felt that good grammar would not necessarily increase someone's opinion of  them but that bad grammar would definitely detract from someone's opinion of them, especially in job interviews; and a number of the students felt that teachers were purposely looking for mistakes in student work.

It outlines common misconceptions about the elderly, centering on their state of mind, health, capacity for work, interest in life and sexual activity, and financial condition, and it notes that despite television's capacity to serve a number of functions for the elderly, it reinforces such stereotypes in advertising and programing. The second part of the booklet provides exercises for use in a unit on communication and the elderly, designed to restructure patterns of communication that manifest or reinforce negative  stereotypes about older persons and the aging process. Exercises are grouped in the following four sections: diagnosing attitudes toward the elderly; examining the various media (television, magazines, and children's books) for positive and negative stereotypes toward the aging; encouraging empathy with the elderly regarding their communication difficulties; and encouraging intergenerational communication.

In the studies, expectations about group work procedures fell into two categories: high procedural order (HPO) and low procedural order (LPO). Each category consisted of four properties. For HPO the properties were use of planned, sequential patterns for organizing tasks; concern for time management; an emphasis on regular procedures; and an emphasis on clarifying procedures. The four LPO properties were use of chain-association patterns for developing ideas, flexibility in establishing and changing plans, oblivion to time constraints, and vacillation between task and socioemotional issues. Individual expectations  for group work climate were derived from scores on the Group Procedural Order Questionnaire (GPOQ). In the first study, analysis of interaction across six small-group meetings demonstrated that HPO subjects initiated HPO statements, while LPO subjects generated socioemotional ones. In the second study, HPO subjects surpassed LPO ones in their use of procedural clarification acts, their application of goal-related statements, and their reliance on general headings to introduce new topics. In the third study, LPO subjects employed a high frequency of interruptions, multiple-conversations, and topic changes, whereas HPO members produced messages that pertained to agendas, lists of alternatives, and task deadlines.

The acculturation process is a natural process of adaptation, occurring in and through communication; it is the process of acquiring the communication mode of the host society. The acculturation process is interactive and continuous, evolving in and through the communication of an immigrant with the new environment. The subsystems of the host society that are of direct and significant functional relevance to an immigrant's daily life are the most influential in the acculturation process. The role of mass media in this process is to provide  cultural information beyond the immigrant's immediate environment. The media role is dependent on the receptivity of the immigrant, and is more limited than are the roles of personal and interpersonal communication in regulating immigrant behavior. Mass media works with interpersonal communication to reinforce acculturation and its influence is particularly strong during the initial phase of that process. (DF)",

Robert McKay claims that adequate grievance procedures could alleviate the adversary relationship growing between students and schools. Paul Alphen discusses the concerns and roles of boards of education in grievance policies, including implementation and the effects of such policies on teacher  contracts, program costs, and costs of court litigation. William Clifton argues that it is the state's duty to develop effective statewide grievance policies and oversee their application. Staff members from the Center for Community Justice analyzed six grievance processes used in junior and senior high schools and found all lacking.

        "description":"This study, the third in a series of reports, is limited to an analysis of the energy use and cost implications of nine school calendars proposed by the New York State Department of Education. These calendars are characterized as (1) traditional; (2) ten-month school year; (3) mid-August start, two semesters; (4) four-day week; (5) four-day, 7.5 hours; (6) four- and five-day weeks; (7) twelve-month, multiple variations; (8) five eight-week learning periods; and (9) 45-15 rotation. The factors of daily weather, schedule of operation, and building characteristics were combined to simulate the actual operation of the typical school in each climate for each calendar. The magnitude of the variations was small with only the four-day, 7.5 hour calendar producing more than a 10 percent  change in all four climates. Given the slight differences between the various calendars observed, the study concludes that it would be difficult to make a strong case for one calendar over the others on the basis of its energy saving potential.

RBS reviewed the literature to extract future planning needs relevant to educational practitioners. These needs were assessed in a survey of 162 innovative educators and served as the basis for four independently created educational designs for the future. The only constraints on these designs were a requirement for implementation by 1985 and a consideration of cost effectiveness. This document discusses the planning needs found in the study and presents the four designs based on them: John A. Connolly's plan focusing on  mastery of basic cognitive, life, and career skills; Glen Heathers's design for training students to be adaptable to change in schools redefined as centers for guiding and coordinating instruction; Patricia Henning's design for a comprehensive integration of school and community; and David Helms's Comprehensive, Adaptive, and Responsive Educational System, an instructional management system with an inschool research and development component.

The aims of the study were to provide a national picture of secondary education and increase understanding of private secondary education in particular. For the private school study, 600 private schools were randomly selected from four regions of the country and three metropolitan areas. These schools were surveyed concerning curriculum, schedules, facilities, school structure, coordination mechanisms, and principals' goals, satisfactions, experience, and problems. The data from private and public schools were then utilized to  compare the two on the above characteristics as well as on grading systems, student goals and activities, and sex of principal. The study concluded that public and private schools differ in mission. Public schools provide a wide range of courses to a wide range of students, have more management problems, and are not dependent on maintaining a constituency. Private schools, on the other hand, have a narrower curriculum focused on academic subjects, have fewer management problems, and are more responsive to their clientele and staff. (Author/JM)",

Researchers relied heavily on current theoretical perspectives on the nature of educational systems, particularly those that emphasize the &quot;loosely coupled&quot; nature of educational organizations. Two hypotheses were tested. The first is that natural system change over a short period of time will exhibit characteristics of loose linkage and that change in one system characteristic will not be significantly associated with changes in other system characteristics. The second was that there will be negative relationships between the level of system change and the level of implementation of planned program change. The research was based on a secondary analysis of data previously collected to examine a  planned change program. Teachers in 45 schools located in 10 rural school districts completed questionnaires, and onsite ethnographers collected structured data about program implementation. Analysis revealed no evidence to suggest that changes in one part of the system reverberate throughout the system, but patterns of association among some parts were apparent. The data also indicated that it is reasonable to expect either changes in the characteristics of the organization or in the technology of the organization but to attempt both types simultaneously is unrealistic.

A five-year research project in California, the Beginning Teacher Evaluation Study (BTES), tried to avoid these problems through the use of nonstandardized testing, teacher questionnaires and interviews, and multiple objective behavioral observations of interaction between students and teachers. A wide range of classrooms and schools were sampled to allow for socioeconomic differences. The researchers found that students learned best when spending sufficient time deeply engaged in a task with a high success rate. Teachers were  most effective at creating such learning situations when they did a good job of diagnosing student needs, prescribing appropriate tasks, structuring presentation of the tasks, monitoring student progress, and providing adequate feedback. While BTES, despite its name, never directly addresses itself to teacher evaluation, its findings imply answers to the questions of what to measure when evaluating teachers and how to measure it. The study also points the way to future definitive research of a more immediately practical nature. (Author/PGD)",

Job queue and labor market segmentation theories argue that improved education merely drives up employment criteria and that the socioeconomic background of the employee is a more significant indicator of earning potential. Marxist theory claims that education is a training process for the capitalistic system, which uses disparate wages simply as a means to structure and control the work force. With these concepts as a background, the author of this document conducted a research project intended to produce a methodology for predicting the potential effects of various educational strategies on the equalization of earned income among males. The  method, described in this document, depends on obtaining accurate responses to survey questions concerning educational attainments, backgrounds, occupations, and earnings. A test of the method in El Salvador is described. The author concludes that the impact of education on wealth equalization is far less than has been traditionally supposed and that attempts to equalize wealth through educational strategies are doomed to failure unless those strategies and goals are appropriate to the political and economic structure of the country.

        "description":"Student absenteeism has been declining in the United States since records were first kept in the late nineteenth century. Even so, some districts, usually urban, have found absentee rates doubling or even tripling over the last ten years. The tendency of teacher absenteeism to rise in districts where student absenteeism has increased sharply merely adds to the problem. The absence of students affects not only the funding available to most schools (often dependent on average daily attendance figures) but the education of the truant students and the ability of the educational system to teach effectively those students who do attend. To date no major studies have focused successfully on the correlations between student and teacher absence rates or the specific root causes of  absenteeism. This document discusses the factors involved in this dilemma, including the rationales for attendance expectations; the intentions behind and alternatives to compulsory schooling; the characteristics of absentees; and the relationships of school size, school programs, and the educational environment to absence rates. The document concludes with brief descriptions of nine programs designed to reduce absenteeism in schools around the country. (Author/PGD)",

        "description":"Based on a review of literature on educational change, this study explored the fundamental dynamics of stability and change in public school systems. Five major factors were identified that affect and interact with innovation. These factors include leadership effectiveness, external funds, external linkage, conflict, and support for innovation. Support for innovation is a function of the relationship between the level of innovation and leader, professional, and community norms. A computer model was constructed that expressed mathematically the relationships among these factors that account for the change behavior of school systems over time. Computer runs demonstrated the ability of the model to reproduce the ebb and flow of innovation in school districts over time, both where  stability of community norms is assumed and where the community is seen in a state of transition. Findings indicated that a small number of fundamental structurally interconnected elements account for the basic stability of schools in the face of efforts to innovate. Also, incremental approaches to innovation seem to produce long-term effects superior to effects of dramatic attempts to bring about quick change. Finally, policies promoting networking among school people produce more positive impact on innovation than policies based on funding alone. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This paper deals with the events that led to a need for problem-solving measures in the Richmond, Virginia, Public Schools, and describes the planning strategies that have evolved since 1973. Events of the late 1960s and early 70s that had a major impact on the school system included three changes of superintendents (that brought three reorganizations), court-ordered desegregation plans, court-ordered annexation, and a court suit seeking consolidation of the metropolitan school systems. The fall of 1973 marked the beginning of the massive planning project. The development of the school system's educational planning capability can be viewed in two stages, each described in this report. Stage 1 was known as the Educational Services Priority Planning Program or ESP-3 and was based  almost entirely on a participatory planning strategy. Stage 2 of the development of planning capability was a more formalized approach and is considered in this paper as having begun with the formation of a department of planning and development.

        "description":"Rather than concentrating on similarities, it would seem far more profitable to search for ways in which schools are unlike other organizations or the models we have of these. It was suggested that we need to begin building images of schools that are congruent with their reality. This paper attempts the first stage in the task by identifying major generic characteristics of schools in general and public schools in particular. The generic characteristics of schools in general are pupils, classes, instruction, teachers, curriculum, and authorities external to the school itself, which is located on specialized premises. Ideal-type public schools are distinguished by external authorities that form part of a hierarchically organized administrative structure in a sovereign state and  compulsorily enrolled pupils that are permanently resident within the territorial jurisdiction of the state. Comments are restricted to two implications for administrative theory and two possible uses in organizational analysis. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"Curriculum development is an activity that goes on in all school districts, although in some districts it is haphazard and in others it is carefully planned. School district leaders must recognize this situation and take charge of the program to assure that it adheres to high standards. The efforts of each teacher must be &quot;mapped,&quot; which means the real curriculum being taught in each classroom must be examined and recorded. This curriculum mapping can be done by having teachers map their own classroom curricula by using such tools as a classroom curriculum mapping worksheet. It can also be done by having observers use tools like an observer form for curricular mapping to record what is being taught in the classroom. The results of this mapping must be the beginning point for  making the real curriculum fit the desired curriculum. Curriculum directors, coordinators, supervisors, and other administrative personnel are a vital ingredient in any program of quality control in curriculum development. They are the only ones who can assure the district that the curriculum being taught is the desired curriculum. These administrators must be valued, nurtured, and protected by the superintendent of schools. (Author/JM)",

The purpose of the workshops was to try out a basic format and some techniques perceived to be potentially more beneficial to the participants than the typical convention or meeting. A basic position taken in developing the format and materials for the workshops was that efforts to change educational practices, either in larger or smaller schools, have tended in the past to emphasize what should be changed, rather than how change might best occur. A review of literature revealed that recent experience in bringing about change in organizations  has tended to indicate that the process, or change strategy, is more important than the identification of product or change desired. The format for the inservice workshops was designed to provide simulated experience in a change process that could be used with teachers and other school personnel. (Author)",

It examines change in the distribution of revenues and expenditures between 1975-76 and 1978-79, the equity of these distributions, how budget caps influenced these shifts, and the relationship between expenditures and the distribution of educational resources. These issues are examined in light of the negligible effect of the Public School Education Act of 1975. This act, the report states, was designed to meet the New Jersey Supreme Court's objections in Robinson v. Cahill that heavy reliance on local property taxes to pay for education was not producing the constitutionally mandated, thorough and efficient  education for students.

Among conclusions were that the S's autistic behavior patterns were remarkably modified and the reinforcement function was verified.

Students were first treated verbally and asked R. Blackwood's four question format: What did you do that was wrong? What unpleasant things happen when you do it? What should you have done? What nice things happen when you do what you should? Then Ss were presented with a standard essay to copy (samples are appended). Results indicating increased consistency of student performance supported the usefulness of the essay mediation technique in reducing talking  out behavior.

The study sought to determine the effect on university performance of the following  variables: the Sudan School Certificate, interviews, secondary school attended, proficiency tests, and university English final examinations. Eight months after the orignial testing, subjects were retested in reading and administered a questionnaire. The conclusions are that English language proficiency is a major problem for the preliminary-year students and that there are potential problems of a linguistic and an attitudinal nature with Arabic as a medium of instruction in the university.

It is important: (1) to see the need for knowledge of the language situations of the United States, (2) to support training and research to obtain such knowledge, and (3) to change the relationship between linguistics and education. The language situation of Black Americans, Native Americans, and Spanish-speaking Americans, uses of language and ethnic heritage, and the issue of bilingual education for communities of Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, and others are addressed. Initially in the field of linguistics, language structure was divorced from language use, but now language use is included by most along with language structure. A linguistics that is truly the science of language and a  foundation for education will need to be part of the study of communicative interaction. Linguistic competence needs to be viewed as part of communicative competence, and the character of competence needs to be understood in relation to the social history and social structure that shape it in a given case. The concepts of inherent heterogeneity and hidden hegemony in relation to language problems are discussed. Equality of opportunity and the development of the fullest linguistic potential of the child are also addressed. (SW)",

        "description":"In a written discourse consisting of a string of \"psychological paragraphs,\" there is in each such psychological paraqraph a \"head\" structure containing the topic which derives from the deep structure of the discourse. That \"head\" assertion differs from all other assertions in the psychological paragraph in that it carries new information. The topic expressed in the head assertion is maintained through the remainder of that psychological paragraph by the operation of \"focus\" which is achieved through appropriate choice among available syntactic alternatives. An attempt to provide empirical verification of these assumptions is described. It seems that native and non-native speakers differ in their ability to determine what presuppositions may in fact be shared between writer and  reader in a given communication setting (a cultural problem). Secondly, native and non-native speakers differ in the strategies they can bring to bear on the maintenance of any given topic because they have available different sets of syntactic alternatives among which to choose. The non-native speaker uses available syntactic alternatives from his native language and arranges those alternatives in terms of the rhetorical preferences of it. Therefore it would appear that knowledge of the syntax of the second language is not in itself sufficient. There is a need for more elaborated studies of the intersentential syntax underlying focus in various languages. (Author/AMH)",

Conventional instruction consisted of lecture with discussion and laboratory periods. The mastery-based auto-tutorial instruction consisted of multi-media modules that the learner studied until mastery was attained, and student-teacher communication was minimal and occurred only in individual discussions. Undergraduates enrolled in an undergraduate course in wildlife recreational techniques were administered the following tests: the Ac (achievement via conformance) and Ai (achivement via independence) scales of the California Psychological Inventory, the  internal-external locus of control scale (Rotter, 1966), a multiple-choice achievement test covering content from the experimental unit, a delayed achievement test developed and administered eight and one-half weeks after the experimental period, and semantic differential scales designed to measure student attitudes. The findings indicate that one can enhance learning by using Ac scores to match students with an instructional treatment. Students with low Ac scores achieved better when assigned to mastery instruction and students with high Ac scores achieved better when assigned to conventional instruction. (SW)",

Usable responses from 1,457 students provided information on expectations of the college experience and selected background information. A second questionnaire on the reality of the college experience was sent to the students during the spring semester of the following year. Of the 1,457 students, usable responses were received from 773 freshmen. Student-faculty relationships were measured on eight scales; six of the scales were concerned with the  frequency of student-faculty informal contact. The remaining two scales assessed students' perceptions of the quality and impact of their informal interactions with faculty and faculty concern for teaching and student development.

Student enrollment data, governmental measures taken to meet needs, and effects of the action within higher education are examined. Results of mass higher education in terms of its principal expectations and future prospects are also analyzed. France and Belgium are eighth and ninth respectively in the rate of increase in higher education from 1950 to 1965. In France the transition to mass higher education has led to a complete restructuring of the predominant sector of higher education, and the process is even now incomplete. Belgium has made this transition without significant alterations in the basic structure of its institutions. The cases of the two countries offer some suggestive  material about the social consequences of different forms of system organizational structure in higher education. (SW)",

By 1976 there was an 87 percent retention rate among the original respondents. Grades were found to be lower at college preparatory high schools and higher at vocational-technical high schools. Plans for college were found to be unaffected by school type, and plans for further vocational training were somewhat lowered by attending a specialized area vocational high school. Academic enrollment was found to be more frequent as a  result of attending a college preparatory high school, and postsecondary training, broadly defined, was found to be unaffected by school type. Possible reasons for these findings, ways high schools can influence students, and implications for further research are discussed. (SW)",

Such activities provide benefits to the faculty, the university, and to society, but potential conflicts of interest and problems in the use of salaried time and institutional resources have become increasingly apparent. The current survey, with a response rate of 63 percent, revealed that trustees have limited knowledge of policies existing at their institutions and have few plans for substantial future involvement. They also indicated that they are unwilling to delegate responsibility for policy development and implementation to administration, faculty, or  students. Information was obtained on nine broad policy areas: internal load and overload, external activities, conflict of interest, production/use of educational materials, patents and inventions, continuing education/extension, salary reimbursement for externally-funded projects, Paid sabbatical leave, and computer usage.

The single most important aspect of the bargaining process that determines the nature of collective bargaining is enabling legislation. Changes that have appeared to influence the probability of unionization concern the renewed emphasis on accountability and the more permissive legal authorization for collective bargaining in higher education. Unit-determination refers to the composition or nature of the group of employees forming the bargaining unit. After the unit determination has been made, the next logical step is an election to see which, if any, of the potential bargaining agents will represent the unit. The three major union groups for  teachers are noted, and some of the typical items included in a collective bargaining agreement in higher education are defined. Sources of difficulty in implementing a contract that has been accepted by both parties are discussed, as are challenges and decertification of a bargaining agent. (SW)",

The reliance upon average cost information in making resource allocation decisions was critiqued for the special problems that arise from student enrollment decline or steady state. A model of resource allocation for institutional and interinstitutional decision making was designed based on the separation of expenditures into fixed and variable cost components. Measures for full costing, including partial opportunity cost accounting were incorporated into the model. The UniversiLy of Colorado at Boulder was used to examine the cost structure in terms of average, marginal, variable, and fixed cost elements. The change in this cost structure was  examined for a five-year period as personnel policies and enrollment changes were stimulated. Specific hypotheses were posited and tested. Results indicate areas of policy change and extensions for further research. It is concluded that a decrease in student number cannot be accommodated with the same policies as the growth period.

Reasons for the increasing importance of this type of evaluation, approaches to and components of an evaluation plan, some of the problems involved in the evaluation process, and use of results are discussed. The current literature indicates that increased presure from above and below and the demand for accountability from government and institutional constituencies make administrative evaluation important. Evaluation usually presupposes some sort of comparison either with predecessors, peers, some ideal, past performance, or others' expectations. Evaluation criteria usually concern administrative skills and personal characteristics. The idea of faculty involvement in administrative evaluation  seems to be growing in acceptance but ultimate responsibility rests with the board. The greatest problem in evaluation is the difficulty of rational and objective judgment. Generally, higher education does not really lend itself very readily to systematic assessment. The use of results should be known and agreed to by all concerned prior to the actual evaluation process. (SW)",

Data were drawn heavily from the Fall 1976 Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS) and the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Statistical data are presented on black student enrollment in higher education by various types of institutions, by level of study, by major field of study, and by state.  Enrollment data are provided for fall 1976 and for previous years in some tables. Medical and law school enrollment data are also provided. The scope and impact of 18 federal programs sponsored by the U.S. Office of Education that are directly or indirectly related to the issue of access are discussed. An analysis is provided of the extent to which such programs have assisted black, minority, or low-income students to gain access to and participate more fully in higher education. Information on the impact of such programs on blacks is available to only a limited degree because data on participants were not systematically collected by specific racial-ethnic group.

In late 1976 and early 1977, a team of systems analysts and dental consultants visited three dental schools to observe the delivery of dental services and patient flow and to interview administrative staff and faculty. Although the schools visited were selected to be reasonably representative, they do not constitute a statistically significant sample. Based on individual site-visit reports, information was synthesized to form a composite dental school dental delivery system description. Contents of the report are as follows: historical information on the dental school delivery system and information on the schools visited; a broad systems overview of the  composite system and the components that make up the system; a discussion of the major characteristics of the system (organization, funding, services, effectiveness, efficiency, and quality assurance); and discussion of each element of the delivery system and of the flowchart that describes the composite system, as viewed from the perspective of the patient.

Objectives of the study included: investigation of the availability of data on state and local support for health manpower training and development of methods for obtaining these data; and utilization of these procedures to collect information for FY 1974 and FY 1975. The two-phase study methodology is explained and financial data and program statistics for all major health professions and allied health occupations are presented. Financial support categories include: institutional support,  capital outlay, student aid, and direct support. For each of the 32 states examined in depth, state funds by institutions and program are tabulated for each financial support category. Total financial support for health manpower training for all 50 states was $1.5 million during FY 1974, an increase of 23 percent over FY 1973. For 32 states the mean per capita higher education appropriation for health manpower training programs was $46.35, with an average figure of $5.29. Variations in program expenditures in different states ranged from a high of $15.26 per capita for Oregon to a low of $1.97 for Massachusetts. It is recommended that: the survey be repeated on a regular basis; the scope of the survey be increased; a mail survey be conducted; an index be developed and printed; and an  in-depth analysis of state support be conducted that coordinates federal and state support indices.

During its four-year history, the project focused on four issues: the licensure/approval of postsecondary institutions by states; the respective roles and functions of the states, the Federal Government, and the nongovernmental accrediting agencies in the governance of postsecondary education; the impact of government policies on  improvement efforts in postsecondary education; and the emerging federal and state role in lifelong learning. Project objectives were largely carried out through convenings and publications.

Educational television is utilized through the Ivorian primary system, and battery operated televisions have been widely distributed to schools in rural regions. The E/S system, begun in 1973, utilizes these facilities to reach adult audiences in the villages with a wide range of educational and informational TV programs related to national development. An &quot;animateur,&quot; usually a male primary school teacher, is charged with publicizing the TPT (Tele Pour Tous) broadcast, showing the program, and fostering post-broadcast discussion. This report provides a description of the E/S structure and  the context in which it operates; specific estimations of the yearly costs of the various system components--administration, program production, program transmission, support materials production and distribution, program reception, and system evaluation; a discussion of aspects of the E/S system which may entail social costs not captured by the monetary price measures used; a translation of the annualized cost description into cost functions as a means of viewing the cost impact of various policy decisions; and a discussion of various perspectives on the Ivorian development context within which the system costs must be assessed. Appendices provide examples of results of previous evaluations, and a list of references is attached. (Author/BBM)",

This report discusses the relevance of the topic as a theme for an adult education TV program series, describes and analyzes the development of the two series of broadcasts and one individual broadcast, and explains the research design and methodology which provided the data to make an assessment of the impact of the TV programs in terms of awareness, learning and behavior, or action. Findings indicate that, although the program reached a considerable audience and generated a high level of interest, certain obstacles exist which make implementation  difficult, and interest declines over time. It is suggested that the impact of such programs would be enhanced by the active promotion by OSTV of local Tele-Clubs as nuclei for action; by more active cooperation by government agencies and private organizations concerned by the issues in the preparation and follow-up of OSTV programs; and by limiting the number of communal actions advocated and proposed in the programs.

Each scenario is described by the choice of a particular  option in each of the seven relevant areas of decision identified; these areas fall into three categories--specification of alternative channels of post-primary education, options affecting student flow, and options affecting the efficiency (and cost) of providing post-primary education.

Designed to supplement data obtained through questionnaires, this study focused on those aspects of OSTV animation and impact which are difficult to assess through the written word, and obtained information directly from the villagers. Additional objectives included reinforcing ties created by the establishment of the observer network, providing field research experience for three Ivorian graduate students, verifying that reported decisions or actions had been taken as a result of OSTV programs,  and determining if the water situation has improved since the showing of the program series on that topic. Animators and villagers identified several reasons for the wide gap between the two groups; however, the basic difficulty was seen to be that the primary teachers acting as animators are outsiders, frequently reluctant to involve themselves in village affairs, while the villagers consider development affairs to be village decisions and do not ask the teacher for advice. Topics suggested by villagers for future programs and the interview questionnaire for villagers are included. (BBM)",

        "description":"The relationship of eye movements while watching television to reading ability, cognitive style, and mode of presentation was studied using as subjects 85 third-grade children who had been classified as good or poor readers by scores on the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test; their cognitive style was measured by the Children's Embedded Figures which classified subjects as field dependent or independent. A Polymetric Eye Movement recorder was used to measure attention as children viewed seven static and seven dynamic segments from The Electric Company. The results indicated that the effects of these factors varied from segment to segment although several overall effects achieved significance. It was concluded that eye movement research is a useful tool for assessing individual  differences across instructional modes. (Author)",

These factors included institutional commitment, faculty rewards, instructional design staff expertise, campus audiovisual production services, program evaluation, and faculty interest in innovation. A 3-part questionnaire was administered to project directors: Part I identified the general nature of the project and the person responding; Part II consisted of a 50-item measure of perceived success factors in instructional development; and Part III provided for self-ratings of project success. The most important findings have been the completely different factor structures. Where respondents  in the United States saw the issues as provision of support services, organizational support with good administrative systems, faculty incentives, and financial resources, the Australian respondents saw the major issues as provision of support and administrative services, status of the project internally and externally, positive and clear innovative climate, and expertise and skills of the faculty to carry out the project.

The study also attempted to identify those factors which might lead to increased amounts of instructional development by K-12 media professionals. Conclusions revealed a positive relationship of competencies, attitude, budget, empathy, and non-supervisory time with reported performance of instructional development activities; however, it was found that volunteer assistance--students or parents--did not  contribute to the amount of instructional development undertaken.

Following the informative presentation, each subject completed a 25-item comprehension test and measures of self-reported enjoyment and helpfulness. The results indicated that there were no significant differences between the printed text, the cartoon text, and the audiovisual presentation in terms of comprehension scores.

For each state, a four-page section presents detailed historical data, including annual birth patterns, population migration statistics, and rates of student persistence in high school--major factors underlying the projections. Detailed enrollment projections are presented, along with analytical tables, and a comprehensive cohort graph. A brief written explanation accompanies each state section. A description of the report methodology is presented separately. The projections for each state (except Wyoming) show a  common pattern including the following elements: (1) a peak in enrollments between 1975 and 1982, (2) a significant decrease from that peak to a low point in the 1984-86 period, (3) an increase until 1988 or 1989, (4) a decrease to another low point in 1990 or 1991, and (5) an increase to 1995, the last year of the projection. This basic pattern is the same as that for the country as a whole. However, in the West, projected graduates remain below the 1979 peak throughout the projection period but not nearly so far below as for the United States as a whole. (DR)",

Findings were based on first quarter grade reports for 691 students entering CSULA in 1977-78. Of the 691 entrants, 561 (81%) completed some work. The first quarter GPA earned by the 561 entrants was 2.47--0.18 grade points below their LACC average of 2.65. Thirty-nine percent of the students earned a \"B\" average or better at CSULA; 22% fell below a \"C\" average. Students in Engineering (3%) earned the highest GPA at CSULA (2.72), while students in Business (22%) and Education (1%) had the most difficulty, earning GPA's of 2.21 and  2.04, respectively. Highest averages (3.0 or better) were earned in courses in Music, Physical Education, Engineering, Pan-Afro Studies, and Art. Lowest averages occurred in courses in Counselor Education, Economics, and Criminal Justice. Since 1957, the GPA earned by new LACC transfers to CSULA has ranged from 2.36 to 2.60, with the differential between CSULA and LACC GPA's ranging from -0.18 to +0.21. The -0.18 differential in 1977-78 was apparently due to unusually high LACC GPA's. The number of 1977-78 transfers increased in 1976-77, stemming a five-year downward trend. (DR)",

        "description":"\"Cooling out\" was identified in 1960 as a specific function of the community college in redirecting students who experienced academic failure. The \"soft\" cooling out process, which re-directs students into less demanding curricula or out of the college through counseling and advising rather than academic discipline, will increasingly become a reality in the four-year college and university as patterns of student attendance change. There are indications that many recent high school graduates who previously would not have attended college or would have attended a two-year institution are now entering four-year schools, and these students bring new goals, needs, and requirements. If patterns of student attendance change as suggested, three areas need to be reconsidered. First, each  institution needs to consider the cooling out function and its appropriateness to the college's mission. Second, student personnel staff must be trained in academic advising and career guidance to strengthen the work done in these areas by faculty. Third, there must be options within the college curriculum to serve a diverse student body. Consideration must be given to alternatives to the traditional academic and liberal arts curricula to make remedial, professional, and career education more available, even within the four-year colleges and universities.

        "description":"This paper discusses the process of culture acquisition and recommends a new methodology for investigating this process. An examination of the relationship between culture acquisition and cognitive development is followed by a discussion of the way previous research has dealt with this relationship. It is argued that recent developments in linguistics and psychology, as well as in anthropology motivate a reexamination of current assumptions concerning what constitutes a feasible and productive approach to the study of culture acquisition. A new approach is advocated in which culture acquisition is a life-long process of adaptation to one's social and physical environment which is punctuated by periods of relative congruence between one's current theory of reality and the  information currently available about that reality. Some examples of how this approach might be applied are provided, using as data research by Williams and Danziger on children's use of kinship terminology, supplemented by some original research data on children's use of honorifics (terms denoting respect). Finally, a summary of the critical issues in the culture acquisition process is provided along with specific recommendations for future research on the topic. (Author/BH)",

The program, which involves the use of a novel about children to promote discussion, attempts to engage elementary students in philosophical debate about such issues as the bases of moral decisions and the justification of one's beliefs. The study involved multiple conditions differentiated by setting (Newark, New Jersey or Denton, Texas), by teacher preparation (attendance or non-attendance at workshops), by student ethnicity (black, Hispanic or white), and by the amount of time students spent on the program materials. Also, comparisons were made with control groups not in  the program. The student factors measured included curiosity, questioning, reading, listening comprehension, logical thinking, creativity, attitudes toward experimentation, and understanding of interpersonal relations. In addition, the teachers were surveyed about their attitudes toward the program. Data are presented in 16 tables and samples of test items are appended. (BH)",

        "description":"In addition to the important role of memory strategies in mediating age changes in recall performance, it is clear that the permanent memory system (or information available in the knowledge base) exerts a significant influence on the acquisition and retention of information. Age changes in memory performance will be fully understood only through the investigation of the interrelationships among memory processes and the evolving knowledge base. It seems likely that the knowledge base can affect memory performance either &quot;directly&quot; or mediated via the operation of deliberate memory strategies. Research on verbal rehearsal and organization provides an example of the &quot;direct&quot; case. Given a stimulus list with a strong built-in organization (such as a set of taxonomic categories  presented in a blocked fashion), children who are active and passive rehearsers show minimal differences in performance. Investigations of the mediated case concern the effects of stimulus familiarity on rehearsal and recall. Preliminary data suggest that extended familiarity with to-be-remembered materials, perhaps resulting in stronger inter-item associations in the knowledge base, may be critical for the maximally efficient execution of active rehearsal techniques. This and other findings suggest that the implementation of a deliberate organizational strategy is not content free, but rather depends upon the nature of the to-be-remembered material to which the strategy is to be applied.

Of primary concern was the need for a current evaluation of maternal and child health services delivery systems and the implications of this evaluation for health professional education in the Americas. The monograph consists of five position papers on child health care, 10 papers on case studies  involving different methods of evaluation and different types of child health care programs, followed by discussions, and two papers on uses of evaluation in education.

Examining the factors that underlie the dramatic enhancement of the learning of skiing led to the focus on the processes of simplification, debugging, and coaching. These three processes are studied in detail, showing how the structure of each is affected by the basic skill required to perform a task, the equipment involved in its execution, and the environment in which the skill is executed. Throughout, parallels are drawn between the process of learning to ski, and learning computer programming and problem solving. The goal is to achieve insight into the complex issues of skill acquisition and design of learning environments  (especially computer based ones) through analysis of the intuitively understandable domain of ski instruction.

The instructional environment places requirements on a natural language understanding system that exceed the capabilities of all existing systems, including: (1) efficiency, (2) habitability, (3) tutorial capability, and (4) the ability to exist with ambiguity. Semantic grammar is presented as a paradigm for organizing the knowledge required in the understanding process that permits efficient handling of such phenomena as pronominalizations and ellipses. The need for a better formalism for expressing semantic grammars is met by the use of Augmented Transition Networks (ATN). The ability of the ATN-expressed semantic grammar to  satisfy the mentioned requirements is demonstrated in the natural language front-end for the SOPHIE system. (Author/JEG)",

Thirty-two enlisted men and women, none of whom had used the inputting techniques being studied, were randomly assigned to the four method groups. The subjects acted as intelligence staff entering information about the enemy into a computerized data base. Subjects received free text messages describing enemy actions, extracted necessary information, and entered the appropriate codes into a variation of the Enemy Situation Data Add (ESDA) format of the TOS system. Results indicated that menus were more error free than  the other inputting methods; also, menus were popular among the subjects and did not have higher mean times than the other inputting methods. To maximize the benefits of the menus, special attention should be given to the design of an operational menu-based inputting system, particularly with respect to length, display speed, and item selection. Spelling correctors or autocompletion should be considered only for experienced users and in operational settings that specifically require such aids. (CMV)",

        "description":"A random sample of 500 graduates (from a total population of 4,046) of Rockland Community College (RCC) were surveyed in two groups, humanities/social science graduates and career program graduates. Career graduates were also individually interviewed. The overall response rate was 52%; telephone checks of non-respondents indicated no respondent bias. Data were also gathered from 15 employers of RCC graduates in the fields of nursing, criminal justice, secretarial skills, and data processing. Sixty-seven percent of the respondents were female, though no significant differences with male responses were indicated. Other respondent characteristics were typical of the school population: 60% were under 30 years of age and 95% were white. Responses revealed that 75% of the graduates  continued to a four-year institution and received bachelor's degrees. For humanities/social science graduates this percentage was 83%, for career program graduates, 67%. The data suggested that many students tended to commute to other institutions and thus remained members of the community. In general, three-fourths of the graduates were working in the field of their choice. No significant correlations were found between salary and age, salary and number of jobs, or salary and degree earned. An overwhelming majority of comments indicated that the work at RCC was too easy. Employers consistently rated graduate employees highly. The survey instruments are appended. (MB)",

        "description":"Developmental education activities should attempt to provide experiences which do not hold the student back from the normal flow of learning and which utilize processes already in the student's repertoire. Virtually all areas of developmental instruction can be supplemented with games and simulations, that is, activities designed to show the process of a possible or actual reality in which roles, resources, rules, and goals are specified. Games and simulations are discrete, complete, and logical. They are approximations, just as laboratory situations or apprenticeships approximate real work situations. In designing or using games, one should (1) determine what the student is to learn; (2) determine what proto-processes or pre-concepts are necessary to do the behavior; (3) design  the general structure of the game by specifying roles, goals, resources, interactions, sequence of events, and external factors; (4) write out the game as a process; (5) design the materials; (6) write the rules; (7) evaluate and revise the game; and (8) pre-test and evaluate the game again. There must be a point to playing the game and that point must be made clear to the student. Behavioral objectives must be clearly spelled out and measured accurately. Whether used in the classroom or in a supplementary learning environment, games and simulations can help the learner gain the advantages of skill facility in the application of a particular discipline's terms and concepts.

        "description":"Five position papers from the American Association of Community and Junior College's (AACJC) task force on small and rural community colleges are presented. On the issue of equal opportunity for the small/rural college, the task force asserts that public policy-making bodies must provide for comprehensiveness in curriculum and in services in all its community college units regardless of size or geographic location. In regard to financing, it is felt that equity in funding in any state system of public and community colleges depends upon the inclusion of some means, mathematical or other, of allowing for the higher costs of operation per unit within the smaller, rural community college. In regard to small colleges and accrediting agencies, it is stressed that any judgements should  entail a preponderance of weight resting with representatives from peer institutions. In the area of federal and state constraints on small college programs, the task force emphasizes that federal funds are not serving to equalize education for students of two-year colleges. In respect to developing the literature and research support of rural community colleges, it is recommended that an AACJC monograph on rural colleges include an updated bibliography, that a collection of literature be established, that AACJC stimulate research, and that the AACJC Journal devote an issue to rural community colleges.

        "description":"In examining research on the characteristics and problems of small/rural community colleges, one finds that a consistent definition of 'rural' does not exist, and that most research has traditionally focused on the differences between private and public colleges, not between small and large institutions. Research indicates that: (1) classes tend to be smaller in the private colleges (most of which have fewer than 1500 students) with the instructors using less reproducible media; (2) there is a much higher percentage of faculty with doctoral degrees (many doctors of divinity) in the private institutions as well as a higher percentage of part-time faculty; and (3) private and small public institutions are underrepresented in political science, Spanish, philosophy, and  interdisciplinary humanities curricula. The literature on small/rural community colleges focuses on problems of finding job sites for cooperative education students and locating factory equipment for occupational students to practice on; the lack of a pool of people from whom to draw part-time instructors; funding limits due to low enrollment; and the overburden of tasks required of administrators. The literature also reveals that the rural college is often a cultural center, and frequently has easier access to private foundation funds. (MB)",

Data tables outline amounts of aid, numbers of recipients, average amount of aid per recipient, and sex/ethnic characteristics of recipients. During the five years studied nearly 20,000 financial aids totaling over $10,000,000 had been provided for LACC students. Amounts of aid from NDSL and CWS increased slightly over the period, whereas assistance under BEOG grew from about 400 students receiving $100,000 in 1973-74 to over 5,000 students receiving nearly  $3,000,000 in 1977-78. Data indicate that female recipients outnumbered male recipients in about the same ratio as their representation in the college population. Blacks (40% of the student population) received slightly over half of the aids, while White, Hispanic, and Asian students followed in that order, each showing percentages somewhat below their percentage in the college population.

Of a random sample of 2,000 day and evening students, 1,266 responded. Data from the fall 1978 survey are compared to those from a fall 1976 survey and to fall 1978 district-wide statistics. The principal reason for attending college given by both day (42%) and evening (53%) students was to \"acquire or improve occupational or technical skills.\" The second most frequently given reason was to \"prepare to transfer to a four-year college.\" Major reasons for attending LACC were that the college was close to home, had no tuition, and had a reputation for good teaching. When asked if they would attend LACC if tuition of about  $5.00 per unit were charged, 25% indicated that they would attend, another 25% indicated that they would if they received financial aid, 25% indicated that they could not afford to attend, and the remaining 25% were uncertain. The principal study interest of day students was fine arts, with business and secretarial programs ranked second; among evening students, business was ranked first and fine arts ranked fourth. A bachelor's degree was sought by 60% of the respondents. About 60% of day students and 95% of evening students were employed. Teaching and the library were the highest ranked student services. Almost 20% had attended high school in a foreign country. (Author/MB)",

The four types of programs support the traditional community college role in preparing the academically, economically, socially, or physically disadvantaged for  entering the mainstream of American life. The present trend is toward integrating the various developmental programs with the regular programs. Pre-Transfer is most closely allied with the regular program and ABE least integrated. The Remedial Program tends to focus on high school graduates or recent dropouts who are slightly older than the regular students. The Handicapped Program includes three principal classifications of students: the blind or visually handicapped, the deaf or hearing impaired, and the mobility-impaired. (Author/MB)",

Specifically, the papers refute allegations made in the book in criticism of community college police education programs. James R. Mahoney's response to the book points out the age and unverifiable nature of much of the data upon which the criticisms were based; contains quotes from Police Education Program administrators in response to specific claims made in the book; criticizes the stylistic tactics which, without evidence, cast a negative light on the programs; and points out the impracticality of the  recommended baccalaureate degree requirements in police education. Additionally, the address points out the values of the study. Howard Rasmussen's presentation contradicts the premise of the study that the role of police education programs should be to educate police for institutional change, stating that the more important goal is the generation and dissemination of knowledge. Also questioned is the belief that a liberal-arts-oriented, full-time, residence education is the best model for police education programs. (AYC)",

Two groups of preschool program graduates (one group including children who had started preschool as 3-year-olds, another including children who had started preschool as 4-year-olds) were compared with a group of control children who had begun kindergarten as 5-year-olds without prior preschool or group care experience. Measures were used to assess social  adjustment as well as cognitive competence, intellectual ability and academic achievement. The results so far indicate that preschool graduates have maintained their preschool IQ and other gains; their academic achievements have been generally satisfactory and have been superior to those of the controls; all of the preschool graduates have been promoted each year, but several of the controls have repeated a grade. In general, children who started preschool as 3-year-olds appear to have made greater initial cognitive gains than children in the other groups, and have so far maintained these gains. (Author/SE)",

Findings are analyzed by age, sex, race, geographic region, urban-rural residence, annual family income, and in relation to other findings. Among children, about 570,000 have a significantly abnormal heart or other circulatory condition. Among youths, more than 1 million have a significant  cardiovascular condition. Among children nearly three-fourths of these conditions are considered congenital, while among youths nine percent are considered congenital. The prevalence of cardiovascular conditions is higher among Negro children and youths than among white groups, higher among those living in the South or in rural areas, and higher among the unschooled and poor. Survey data are presented in 15 tables. Statistical notes, definitions of demographic and socioeconomic terms, and medical history and physical examination forms are appended. (Author/RH)",

In the network approach, college education personnel trained coordinators from school districts who, in turn, disseminated individualization materials and techniques to classroom teachers. Results of teacher surveys showed that teachers rated initial training sessions and summer workshops effective and found that participation in the training increased their use of individualizing techniques. Third and fifth grade students' achievement and attitude data from 1974 and 1976 were analyzed cross-sectionally and longitudinally to investigate program effects in three schools: Model, Parallel, and  Atypical. The Model school was designated as a model of the use of individualized instruction. The Parallel school had a population similar to the Model school but used less individualization. The Atypical school consisted of high-IQ children of middle to upper middle class parents. On almost all achievement subtests, Atypical scores were higher than Model scores. Model scores were higher than Parallel. Reference ability, an outcome emphasized in the individualization program, was greater in the Model school. Attitude data indicated that the individualized programs promoted better attitudes among children toward school and school subjects. The dissemination effort resulted in the development of an undergraduate course in open education at the network college. (Author/RH)",

Program descriptions are presented and suggestions are given for implementing aspects of parent involvement in programs designed to meet the needs of handicapped children. Included are discussions of the desire for varied program approaches to meet individual parent-child needs; language delay and creative programming in the home; child abuse problems and solutions; severe emotional handicaps in children and how parents can help; the need to provide  information for parents (on their children's handicapping conditions, on various types of programs and the theories on which they are based, and on mainstreaming possibilities) to help them make decisions as to the best placement for their children. Advantages of parent-to-parent models which provide opportunities for parents of handicapped children to talk and work together are discussed along with programs focusing on the prevention of childhood handicaps through parent education; educational resources for parents; and parental characteristics and behaviors which are likely to promote optimum development of handicapped children.

Chapter 2 stresses the importance of environment on development, surveys recent views on early childhood development and emphasizes the importance of the family. Chapter 3 surveys serious problems existing in the United States which adversely affect  the development of children, including single-parent families, lack of prenatal care, poor environments, poor nutrition, lack of immunization, and child abuse. Implications of these conditions for school performance are discussed. Chapter 4 explores research findings which indicate that early childhood programs are effective and that parents are receptive to such programs. Chapter 5 delineates the scope of present programs and indicates the unmet need for child and family development programs. Chapter 6 describes HEW-sponsored demonstration programs. Chapter 7 indicates potential benefits and costs of programs and suggests considerations for program implementation. Selected program data are appended. (Author/RH)",

Data were used from eight HSA's in Pennsylvania and one bi-state HSA (Pennsylvania and New York); 241 consumer addresses were analyzed. Two discrete, single variable measures which focused upon demographic and geographic approaches were used to define rurality in order to determine the degree to which the proportion of consumer &quot;rural&quot; members agreed with similar proportions of the population. Using a &quot;rough approximate&quot; test it was found that for either measure the proportion of HSA consumer board members did not consistently parallel the residential characteristics of the population in  the various health service areas. The two indices were then compared to determine if an HSA region varied from one index to another; again, discrepancies existed depending on the index of rurality used to classify consumer residencies. It was concluded that if HSA's continue to be required to have governing boards broadly representing the geographic areas of their health service areas, then a number of issues have to be resolved; the foremost of these is determining the philosophical underpinning for the working definition of rural (i.e., on the basis of demographic and geographic characteristics, economic characteristics, or occupational characteristics).

As professionals committed to student development, student personnel administrators are particularly well-suited philosophically and institutionally to implement an experiential learning program. They command a variety of resources and can accommodate experimental efforts more readily than other university entities. A student affairs experiential learning center (ELC) could, for example, offer outdoor and survival education, cultural journalism, craftsmanship, and/or a variety of avocational leisure-time activities, as well as volunteer service learning activities. The student center  is especially well-suited to house an experiential program, for it already has the facilities needed in an ELC program, an adaptable staff, and great campus visibility. Development of a student affairs ELC must include open communication with other groups and agencies and an interdisciplinary approach that encourages cooperation rather than competition. Provision also must be made for insurance to cover ELC staff, student center, and the university. Evaluation is essential to the program's credibility and its ability to learn from experience. Elements subject to evaluation include individual student outcomes (satisfaction and personal growth), teacher outcomes (personal and instructional development), and program outcomes (effectiveness in terms of the target population).

Findings on the Texas school district bilingual program (intended to develop capability in English and Spanish) revealed: a real attempt to give teachers necessary training; inconsistency between philosophy and practice, e.g., student evaluation through standardized tests in English; that the supervisor had too many responsibilities but lacked input into essential program components; personal attitudes (influenced by salary and class size) affected the performance of those involved. Recommendations relate to the understanding of bilingual education goals, community involvement, curriculum, program assessment, and program financial support. (RS)",

The guide is intended for use by change agents whose major objectives focus on promoting and stimulating social change in rural communities, such as Extension workers, community development specialists, government agency personnel, school administrators, community planners, ministers, business leaders, union leaders, and voluntary association leaders. The four  methods presented are the positional, reputational, decision making, and social participation; for each method, the guide gives a description, assumptions, procedures for implementation, types of power actors identified by the method, and its advantages and limitations. The appendix contains suggestions to aid the change agent in applying each method: positional--a suggested list of formal positions; reputational and decision making--sample questionnaires; social participation--sample list of voluntary organizations.

Data were obtained from the larger Southern Youth Study, 1966-72. Within the framework of the life cycle perspective, early marriage was found to be associated with a set of attitudinal antecedents generally indicative of lower level achievements. Specific findings showed: both blacks and whites who held aspirations and expectations during adolescence for lower level education and occupation married early; actual early marriage was associated in early adulthood with lower attainment as well as with continuation of  lower achievement orientations; negative achievement influence of early marriage was generally pervasive for both males and females, blacks and whites. An unexpected finding was that the interrelationship between marital deferment and achievement attitudes did not appear until early adulthood for blacks, and then for expectations and attainments only. For whites, early marriage had a depressant effect on adolescent and early adult aspirations and expectations, both educationally and occupationally. Findings taken collectively point to timing of marriage as an important behavior influence in status attainment processes. (Author/RS)",

In addition to general information about child abuse and the rural setting, the report describes ACCR and deals with self-help groups, innovation and diffusion, and children's rights. Various human service systems are examined (social  and health services, law/law enforcement, education, recreation, child care, self-help groups) and brief suggestions are made for developing a community project without a federal grant. The second, shorter report describes Operation Reach (involving five Wyoming communities) which placed a community organizer in each project area for two months to mobilize the community and help residents draft and implement a child abuse/neglect prevention program, and includes rationale, concepts, and a description of each program.

Arguments presented in favor of this legislation contend that most (80%) of the states do not presently have safety regulations applicable to youth camps, and it is maintained some camps operate under &quot;appalling&quot; conditions. Arguments presented against this bill contend that youth camp injuries and deaths are not statistically significant and that implementation of the Act would produce administrative waste and ineptly derived  standards which would then be enforced by bureaucrats, rather than trained camp personnel. Statements are presented by witnesses representing the following groups: Girl Scouts, United States of America; American Camping Association; Boy Scouts of America; Christian Camping International; Word of Life International; Camp Fire Girls, Inc.; Camping Association for Mutual Progress; Wilds Christian Camp and Conference Center; Department of Health, Education, and Welfare; Center for Disease Control, Public Health Service; Environmental Health Services Division, Public Health Service; and two U.S. Senators from Connecticut.

        "description":"Agriculture and the railroad were significant forces in the development of Suwannee County, Florida, formally created in 1858 but explored and settled beginning some 300 years earlier. Lumber and cotton caused an early 20th century boom in the county which soon saw the negative effects of both industries. The introduction of tobacco in the late 1920's caused an agricultural resurgence which has continued to the present. By 1970, Suwannee County had become a leading producer of chickens and tobacco. Economically, the county followed national trends in that there were fewer, larger farms in the 1970's than before. From 1950 to 1970 farm-based employment declined 31.7% but the steady increases in manufacturing, construction, and wholesale/retail trade indicated that those industries  will grow in importance, thereby strengthening the county's economic base through diversification. Suwannee County leaders identified this economic potential as one of the county's main strengths but noted the need for recreational and educational improvements to support an expanding economic base. By 1970 non-agricultural employment had become a more important source of income but personal income for county residents was still far below the state average. County population growth statistics were consistent with those for the state of Florida. (SB)",

An area of over 400,000 acres on the Peace River in south central Florida, Hardee County was officially established in 1921. Population in the area grew slowly until after the railroad arrived in the 1880's when both farm products and land increased in value. Historically, agriculture has dominated the local industrial scene, with citrus production, which grosses an estimated $31 million annually, especially important.  While agriculture will continue to be important, phosphate mining may provide a major impetus to the county's growth by 1990. Since 1950 there have been increases in service group, clerical, craftsmen, and foremen occupations. The county's median income in 1969 was much lower than that of the state of Florida, which averaged only half as many living below poverty level. The county also contrasted the state's booming population growth trends until 1970 when an upsurge began. (SB)",

With the growth of the concept of cultural pluralism, however, the Indian community has undertaken programs and activities to preserve the further understanding of their cultures.

Other projects have sought to  preserve the languages, legends, customs, and histories of various tribes. Cultural materials programs that might still evolve include publications on original histories and research on values systems, studies on Indian governments and legal systems, recordings of Indian languages, preservation of Indian oral literature, and changes in instructional and curriculum materials to accurately reflect Indian culture. In addition to describing efforts to preserve the Indian cultures and to promote understanding of them, this document traces the concept of cultural pluralism and its application in American Indian education and discusses the types of curriculum changes necessary to help the two cultures educate each other.

BIA policies, regulations, guidelines, and practices should also be revised to (1) prohibit award of contracts in which the starting date precedes the date of award; (2) establish specific criteria for measuring performance; (3) require supervision of contracts and grants by adequately trained area level officers whose responsibilities have been clearly defined; and (4) prevent self determination training and technical assistance funds from being used for assistance that does not help tribes to develop the capability to negotiate and administer self-determination contracts or grants or to improve their capabilities to fully exercise their self-determination options.

        "description":"Factors contributing to Native students' college success were examined in a study of 50 Native freshmen and 42 non-Native freshmen at the University of Alaska in the 1973-74 academic year. The study compared students in relation to three common explanations of college success: level of academic preparation, goal orientation, ease in the campus social world. Data were obtained from interviews with students, the Student Orientation Services (SOS) counselor, an SOS professor familiar with each student's daily work, and the dormitory advisor, plus university records showing ACT scores, urban/rural background, grade-point averages, and credits completed. Results showed that college success among Native freshmen was most strongly and consistently related to level of academic skills  acquired in high school. Goal orientation, similar for Natives and non-Natives, did not appear to be important to success. Natives were significantly more likely to see the university as an unfriendly place with active prejudice, but no significant relationship appeared between these attitudes and college performance. Study results raised serious questions about the long-term consequences of decreased attention high schools are giving to college preparation of Native students. It was maintained that high schools must increase quality of academic preparation, especially for rural students interested in college. (RS)",

        "description":"Educational strategies that small rural high schools can use to address important developmental needs of rural youth were explored, focusing on the importance of educational environments outside traditional high school classrooms, (i.e., work-experience programs, student exchange programs, and travel-study). Of the 92 Alaskan village high schools with enrollments under 100 which were surveyed, 46 responded. Rural youth developmental needs addressed both self-development oriented and &quot;other oriented&quot; educational goals. Approaches available, with percentages of responding schools having used them, included work-study at local sites, 28%; school-sponsored business, 23%; travel to other district high schools, 35%; travel outside school district--28% within Alaska and 19% outside the  state; Rural Student Vocational Program, 40%; student exchange, 7%; traveling teachers, 14%. A planning framework is presented, suggesting the kinds of experiences most valuable in particular years of high school and ways to integrate programs into a systematic educational approach, along with potential benefits and costs. Programs are grouped into awareness, exploration, and transition programs. An appendix lists organizations that can assist rural schools in arranging experiences outside their district and curriculum/program materials for rural high schools. (RS)",

In the past 12 years Indian tribes in 32 states have received community and industrial development grants to assist them in developing a viable economic base on their lands. Tribes in Arizona have received the greatest amount of assistance with $113,263,174 awarded in the period from August 26, 1965 to September 30, 1977. New Mexico tribal groups received $37,927,795, and Indians in Washington received $37,467,572. Indians in Massachusetts received the smallest amount of assistance: $146,050. EDA grants were made for such projects as planning and impact studies, water and sewer systems, tourism facilities,  industrial parks, and community facilities such as fire stations, community centers, and health centers. Assistance was also given to national Indian groups for conferences, training programs, studies, and other types of activities, including those related to industrial development. In addition to listing the total Indian project funding by state for the 12 year period, this document itemizes the amounts and kinds of assistance given to specific tribes in each state.

The basic assumption underlying this system is that the operation to be monitored is continuous or cyclic with interrelated events known in advance or predictable. By identifying critical events and monitoring them, the system evaluates the overall endeavor. Most monitoring tasks are done by the area directors, regional consultants from the Migrant Education Services Center perform a few tasks, and the State Coordinator takes care of one. The system is displayed by a basic frame showing how the student and his records flow through the system and an administrative frame covering the proposal planning and  implementation cycle. General and specific monitoring questions on each of the two frames help ascertain program progress. Answers to the specific questions are taken from 21 task sheets. Task sheets and their accompanying report forms describe the task, who should do it, when it should be done, its disposition, and what actions may result. The 13 tasks in the basic frame cover checks on recruiting, certificates of eligibility, and Migrant Student Record Transfer System (MSRTS) records, and services and evaluation checks. The eight administrative frame task sheets examine proposals, hiring, budget, staff, utilization, interagency cooperation, and parent involvement. (DS)",

Residents of 166 apartment units in three towers participated in the first study. The group contingency consisted of biweekly payments to residents of the value of the electricity they saved, as compared to predicted use based on temperature. In addition, resident meetings were held in each tower. The group contingencies were initiated in each tower at three-week intervals in a multiple baseline design. Subjects in the second study were residents of 255 apartment units, also in three towers. They experienced the same group contingencies in the same multiple-baseline design, except that they received only 50% of the value of their savings.  In addition, they received a one-time bonus of five dollars if they used 10% or more less than baseline. Results are discussed in terms of theoretical and practical implications. (Author/HM)",

The research orientation discussed is that derived from the developmental theory of Jean Piaget. The misgivings are grouped under two headings: educational claims and metatheoretical considerations. Discussion of these two areas leads to a consideration of how the Piagetian research orientation in science education could be related to professional practice, with particular reference to curriculum and instructional planning, and to the diagnosis of children's learning. It is suggested that in light of these misgivings, it might be  useful to consider an alternative for planning and diagnosing. (Author/HM)",

This paper illustrates and suggests possible explanations for this state of affairs, and indicates research alternatives which seem to hold greater promise for improving practice. Examples of contemporary science teacher education research are presented, asking of each how significant the question is and to what extent the results achieved may be expected to improve science teacher education practices. It appears that the potential influence of the research is, in many cases, unduly restricted by the format of the research and by the implied assumptions about how science  teachers and science teacher educators evaluate proposals for the improvement of practice. Alternatives to the most familiar form of science teacher education research are presented, looking at the significance of the questions and the potential influence of the results. (Author/BB)",

A national probability sample of young adults, ages 26 to 35, was drawn and stratified by region and community size. Approximately 1,300 persons responded to each of the 76 attitudinal and 70 knowledge questions administered by trained energy assessment interviewers. Besides the standard demographic information, each participant was asked to respond to the energy assessment items in the appropriate booklet. The discussion centers upon national results. Group results are also presented according to race, sex, total household income, family size, education, etc. The first two chapters present the results while the third chapter presents the analysis of these results.

A battery of 19 \"reference\" tests for intellectual abilities and a mathematical problem solving test were administered to 82 fourth-grade females and 97 fourth-grade males. Sex-related differences were found for only two of the intellectual variables; neither of these were mathematics achievement variables. However, factor analytic procedures identified six factors (Verbal Comprehension, Induction, Numerical, Perceptual Speed, Symbolic Fluency, and General Mathematics) for females and five factors (Verbal Comprehension-Word Fluency, Induction, Perceptual Speed, Problem Solving and Mathematics Concepts) for males. These different intellectual structures suggested that  males and females approach problem solving differently. (Author/MP)",

        "description":"Questionnaires were sent to U.S. high schools soliciting information on former students who had earned doctorates. The questionnaire provided data on grades, rank in graduating class, and mental test scores. The grades were summarized into four grade-point averages (GPA's), one each for English and foreign languages, social studies, mathematics, and science. Data on the PhD's (and their classmates) were compared by sex, by type of school, by size of graduating class, and by region of the country. The PhD's were also compared by year of doctorate and by field of specialization. Some of the conclusions are as follows: despite the massive increase in doctorate production, there has been no measurable change in ability level of the PhD's; the doctorate-holders are, on the average,  one and one-half standard deviations above the mean of the general population in measured ability. A random sample of the girls graduating in the same classes as the doctorate-holders scored slightly lower than their male counterparts on standardized tests, but achieved better grades, particularly in verbalistic subjects.

Unit topics include self-concept; role clarification; awareness of the physiological differences between the sexes and social attitudes regarding sexual behavior; social and political roles of women in past and present American society; changing opportunities for women in work and marriage; economic problems of women; and analysis of students' own life styles, aspirations, and career interests. For each unit the outline  indicates the rationale and overall goal. The outline also elaborates, for each of the 82 days, specific objectives, teaching strategies, resources, and evaluation techniques. For example, in the unit on women's political role in American society, the objective is for students to apply the definition of political behavior to particular women in American history. The teaching strategy emphasizes individual research reports using resources in the school library. Evaluation is done through written papers in which students describe a famous American woman's accomplishments and examine factors which influenced her development. (AV)",

The three types of 17th century American schools which existed prior to the academy are described: the petty or dame school, the writing school, and the Latin grammar school for the wealthy. The decline of the Latin school in the 18th century was a result of diminishing influence by European traditions and customs and an increasing democratic consciousness. Benjamin Franklin founded the academy system in 1749; it was comprised of three schools, Latin, English, and mathematical, with emphases on the practical applications of science, agriculture, commerce, and industry. By 1800 many  academies had been instituted and the movement spread to the West Indies as a result of missionary and educational efforts. The academy system influenced the scope of courses offered in the universities and encouraged the education of girls. Some of its graduates became the best-educated teachers hired by elementary schools. Finally, the academy clearly marked a transition from the aristocratic Latin grammar school to the more democratic high school. (KC)",

Further, the contribution of education and the media to the shaping and dissemination of values is explored. Kenneth Boulding contends that underlying moral diversity is a \"constitutional consensus,\" or agreement about the legitimacy of processes by which differing values are coordinated. A greater tolerance of diversity develops as the constitutional consensus becomes more secure. Robert N. Bellah suggests that the dominance of \"liberal individualism\" accounts for the current loss of moral consensus. Marvin Bressler examines the role of the university and notes that the components of scholarly  investigation (integrity, open-mindedness, humility, communalism, accountability) may aid in defining the moral functions of undergraduate education. William Miller points out the all-pervasiveness of television, which is not morally neutral, but rather an \"enormously powerful phenomenon. . . about which society needs to make conscious social decisions.\" He emphasizes that the primary purpose of television is to deliver people to advertisers and that content is a secondary consideration. Miller concludes, however, that television justifies itself in its coverage of public events. A summary of discussions following the speeches is included. (KC)",

The system consists of preschool education in kindergartens; ten years of compulsory general education divided into three cycles (primary, gymnasium, and lyceum or vocational education); one to two years of post secondary specialized education; and higher education in universities, institutes, academies, and conservatories. A number of specialized institutions also provide instruction for adults, art students, the handicapped, and Party cadres. Tuition is free at all levels. Romanian is the language of instruction throughout the country, although the Constitution also provides for education in the languages of national minorities. Student achievement is evaluated on the basis of classroom performance,  oral and written examinations, and general behavior. Educational policies are formulated by the central executive organs of the Communist Party and are implemented primarily by state and other governmental organizations. The Ministry of Education normally formulates rules and regulations underlying the educational process for all levels and types of education. Recent developments include an emphasis on adaptation to technological changes through better trained professional manpower in engineering, chemistry, economics, and other fields. (Author/AV)",

Section one offers an argument for teaching about science and social policy; surveys the sociology, politics, and history of contemporary science and technology; and identifies methodological problems in teaching about science and social policy. Included is a discussion of six general learning objectives which should be met in a study of science and social policy. The objectives include understanding the (1) role of citizen participation in policymaking, (2) extent to which scientific and technological developments can change people's lives, (3) ways in which laymen depend  upon experts' knowledge, and (4) importance of translating personal values into participative action. Section two presents social studies units on nuclear energy, electronic technology, and genetic engineering. Each unit includes expository reading material, learning activities, and reading lists.

The study is based on research and evaluation studies with empirical test results and on anecdotal reports of what children have learned. The document is presented in four chapters. Chapter I describes the organization of the study. Chapter II focuses on testing children's basic map knowledge and skills before and after geography instruction. Findings indicate that elementary school children benefit from sequential programs of accelerated instruction in map skills. Chapter III reviews children's conceptual and analytical processes, including vocabulary, reading in geography, and general geographic knowledge. Information is also presented on curriculum evaluation  research, sequencing geographic skills, and anecdotal accounts of geography for young learners. The final chapter presents conclusions: children can learn what teachers set out to teach, operate at a much higher conceptual level than is generally believed, and demonstrate aptitude for learning geographic concepts if they are given the opportunity.

        "description":"Polish folk high schools are modeled after schools developed in the mid-1850s in Denmark to provide general, non-credit education for young adults in rural areas. The main objectives of the folk high schools are to provide a climate for individual student development and to serve as centers where young adults can learn about their cultural heritage. The first Polish folk high school was established in 1900. The folk high school movement developed and prospered along with the growing social consciousness and national awakening which characterized Poland up to World War I. Between the world wars, the folk high school movement was dominated by agricultural expert Ignacy Solarz. Solarz established and directed numerous folk high schools throughout Poland which endeavored to help  young peasants become cultural and social forces in their communities. Political and ideological struggles in Poland after World War II resulted in closing most folk high schools. By 1958, however, changes in the ideological climate of East Europe encouraged the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers Party to reassess its position on cultural and educational matters and made it possible to reestablish the folk high schools. By the 1970s, the folk high schools have again become viable institutions which train young adults from rural areas to become social, vocational, and cultural leaders in their villages. (DB)",

Factors contributing to the establishment of protected areas in the United States are traced from the creation of Yellowstone National Park in 1872 to the present. Arguments in defense of wilderness areas consider nature as: (1) a reservoir of normal ecological processes, (2) a sustainer of biological diversity, (3) a formative influence on the national character, (4) a church, (5) a guardian of mental health, and (6) an educational asset in developing environmental responsibility. Diverse agencies, programs, and efforts exist at all levels. The National Park Service, the United States Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the National Wilderness  Preservation System function on the federal level. Coastal zone management and land use laws protect natural areas on the state level, city and county parks serve as protected areas on local levels, and private organizations such as the Sierra Club also contribute to wilderness preservation. Problems arise from the conflict between economic development and nature preservation, and the popularity of nature areas which leads to their destruction. Programs in Japan, Australia, New Zealand, East Africa, Europe, the Soviet Union, and Canada are also described. (KC)",

An overview of systems which monitor environmental quality is provided by Ralph W. Richardson, Jr., of the Rockefeller Foundation. A report by Martin Holgate (Department of the Environment, England) identifies major topics of concern related to environmental  assessment, including environmental policy, costs of environmental monitoring, deciding what to monitor, and uses of monitoring data. Two papers by Brian Martin and Frances Sella (Global Monitoring System, Nairobi, Kenya) discuss global monitoring activities. The remaining papers are concerned with lead monitoring in Finland (Sven Hernberg, Institute of Occupational Health, Helsinki), rangeland resources in Kenya (David Western, University of Nairobi), monitoring organisms in coastal waters (Edward Goldberg, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, La Jolla, California), ozone networks (R.E.

Of a total of 114 variables examined, the teachers differed on only 14 variables. These data are very similar to results of previous studies in other states. Conclusions are that secondary school psychology teachers have  articulated no clear framework for distinguishing between humanistic and behavioristic principles or methods. Another conclusion might be that teachers seek labels for their courses that are most comfortable for themselves or that they believe their schools' administration would most accept. (Author/AV)",

World forest trends, although often based on inaccurate or misleading information put out by national governments, indicate that the area of land covered with closed forests has decreased from about 25% in 1950 to about 20% in the 1970s. Major causes of deforestation include logging, spread of agriculture, and collection of firewood. Among the economic consequences of uncontrolled deforestation are forest-product scarcity, rising dependence on imported forest products, increasing construction costs, inflation, soaring firewood and fuel prices, health deterioration due to lack of heat and warm food, shortage of paper, and increased flooding in watershed areas. Challenges facing world  forestry include putting a halt to deforestation and meeting elementary fuel and wood needs of developing nations. Countries which have succeeded in reforesting their depleted areas include China and South Korea. In addition, other developing nations are beginning to recognize the urgent need for reform of forestry policies and are developing strategies to improve timber management practices. An example of a state which is experimenting with community forestry is Gujarat, India. (DB)",

Subjects featured in the report are population, marital status, household relationship, family size, migration, educational attainment, labor force status, occupation, industry, income, and poverty. The bulk of the report contains tables of data for the white and black populations, and selected tables are given for the population of Spanish origin. Highlights of the report are summarized in an introductory section. The data indicate that the nation's metropolitan population grew by only four percent between 1970-77, but has not changed significantly since 1975. The population of central cities as a group declined  from 1970-77, while the suburban population increased. In cities the number of young adults aged 25-34 increased, while the number of children under 14 years and adults aged 35-44 decreased. The black population in cities did not grow significantly between 1974-77, but the number of blacks living in suburbs increased by 34% during 1970-77. The labor force participation rate for suburban women began in the mid-1970s to exceed that for women living in cities. After adjusting for price increases between 1969-76, the median income of suburban families showed no change, the median income of city families declined slightly, and the median income for nonmetropolitan families showed a modest increase.

Major objectives of the study were to generate information on how much time students spend enjoying works of art, how important they perceive art to be, how they evaluate works of art, what types of art they prefer, and differences among art activities and attitudes of students in different socioeconomic groups. The document is presented in five chapters. Chapter I concentrates on students' appreciation of art. Findings indicated that substantial numbers of students value art and pursue it in some form. Chapter II presents detailed information about student perceptions of art. Findings indicated that a majority of young people appreciate  art but do not indicate a broad or sophisticated understanding of the nature or function of art in American culture. Chapters III and IV examine young people's general criteria for evaluating works of art. The final chapter offers conclusions, including that students have little experience with art museums and galleries, display varying attitudes toward art depending upon their socioeconomic background, and that schools should place more emphasis on aesthetic education programs.

The survey of citizenship was conducted during the 1968-69 and 1969-70 school years; the survey of social studies was administered during the 1971-72 school year. During the school year 1975-76, items from both assessments were reassessed to determine changes in performance. Test items emphasized political knowledge and attitudes in five major content areas: constitutional rights, respect for others, structure and function of government, political process, and international affairs. In this report, the first five chapters describe results for each of the five content areas. Chapter six gives results for different population  subgroups, and chapter seven presents interpretive remarks about the data by experts in the fields of citizenship and social studies.

The theory of this model is that a person's behavior is a function of their behavioral intention which, in turn, is a function of their attitude towards a behavior and their perception of subjective or social norms concerning that behavior. Participants in testing this model were high school students in the upper three grades. Questionnaires were designed to indicate students' attitudes on smoking, reasons for smoking or not smoking, and the extent of the influence of significant others on their decisions. It is stated that use of this model provides a qualitative as  well as a quantitative understanding of cigarette smoking by high school students. Included in this document are samples of questionnaires submitted to participants and tabular analysis of results. (JD)",

The quantitative methods for discovering cues are listed in the second paper as follows: prespecify a large list of potentially relevant cues and then use observation and regression analysis to narrow the list; use the semantic differential; use multidimensional  scaling; and use Kelly's Role Repertory Test.

A critical review is provided of selected literature on student teaching within the context of two contrasting paradigms for conducting educational research: psychometric and social-anthropological. Most of the research that has been conducted falls within the dominant perspective of the psychometric paradigm under the following five major categories: (1) student teacher attitudes and personality characteristics; (2) the socialization of student teachers; (3) predictors of success in student teaching; (4) interpersonal relationships in student teaching; and (5) experimental attempts to modify student teacher behaviors. All of these  categories are reviewed in depth. It is argued, however, that more emphasis should be placed on the social-anthropology paradigm. Extensive references are provided. (DS)",

The most significant findings include: (1) There has been a slight decline in the percent of graduates who secure teaching positions; (2) There has been a dramatic increase in the number who enter the profession as substitutes, paraprofessionals, or part-time teachers; (3) There are no significant differences among programs  on any of the five subscales embedded within the surveys--self-ratings of performance, supervisor ratings of performance, supervisor ratings of commitment to teaching, graduate ratings of the contribution of student teaching to skill development, and general satisfaction with student teaching; (4) The turnover rate is highest among young, untenured teachers; (5) There are significant program differences on several specific items that focus on employment histories, attitudes, or personal characteristics; and (6) graduates are generally satisfied with the student teaching experience and view the opportunity to teach at more than one grade level or subject area as its most valuable subcomponent.

The assessment process and administrative arrangements are explained. The factor analytic studies of Witkin and his colleagues were deemed especially relevant and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (Revised) was used. Decision points eliminated boys who were mentally retarded (intelligence quotient below 75), and boys who were, or had been, diagnosed  as emotionally disturbed (those diagnosed as untestable or presenting bizarre symptoms). Those chosen for further diagnosis included boys whose achievement score differed by two or more years from their ability score, or boys whose academic achievement was two or more years retarded. Interviews and diagnostic testing were carefully standardized and required about three hours for each boy. Training, quality control, and other administrative procedures are described. (CTM)",

Ten thousand samples of scores on three variables were randomly drawn from a population in which the correlations among the variables were prespecified such that cooperative suppression did not exist. Cooperative suppression occurred in nearly 48% of the samples but the incidence of regression coefficients that were grossly discrepant from the population parameters was rare. The implications for multiple linear regression and a method of causal investigation called path analysis are discussed. (Author/CTM)",

Probably the greatest advantage is that it provides a means by which the nature of the problem may be handily summarized. The method of path analysis, although conceived over sixty years ago by Sewell Wright, has only recently been introduced into educational literature. Its application in substantive analyses in education has also been infrequent. Path analysis requires the researcher to think about systems of intercausal connections and requires a degree of explicitness desirable in scientific writing. Path models may be classified into four categories: recursive, block, block-recursive, and nonrecursive. Each of these requires a somewhat different  strategy of analysis. The strategy for each kind of model is illustrated with substantive examples. The more difficult task of path analysis involves the construction of models that are consistent with sound theory.

        "description":"Path analysis, a technique related to multiple regression analysis is used for ascribing causal relationships among variables. Path analysis involves the construction of explicitly formulated causal models and makes the reasoning explicit in the form of path diagrams and structural equations. Regression analysis is then used to construct path coefficients or beta weights. Several assumptions are required by this model of path analysis. In the given example; teacher age, teacher sex, teacher training, and class size are assumed to influence democratic classroom control directly, and also through their influence on teacher orientation toward task accomplishment (which is assumed to influence democratic classroom control directly). There are a number of advantages of path analysis,  as well as a number of technical and practical problems. Path analysis enables evaluators to conduct local decision-oriented studies and at the same time to investigate theoretical causal mechanisms. However, there are many difficult problems associated with the valid use of the technique, and care must be taken in its application. (Author/CTM)",

When a learner makes a simple movement and is later asked to reproduce it, what is abstracted from the first movement that allows accurate reproduction of the second. The underlying assumption of the project was that unless basic knowledge about how movement information is represented, stored and retrieved, practical considerations on how to teach motor skills will be ill-founded. Thus this report describes a series of experiments which were directed toward that goal in an attempt to isolate the contributions of movement information. Findings that examine the relative contributions of central and peripheral components in simple movement control are summarized, and  educational implications are presented. (Author/RD)",

        "description":"A new method of analysis was used in the Michigan Educational Assessment Program to test minimum competencies in fourth grade reading achievement. This technique permitted a substantial decrease in testing time and costs. The original test consisted of 95 items measuring 19 objectives; mastery was indicated by correct responses to four out of the five items measuring each objective. Data from those 1,096 students whose raw scores were between 36 and 83 were re-analyzed. Several tests were used to determine which items were acceptable for analysis using the Rasch model. It was felt that the 95 items fit the Rasch model, and that the item calibrations would yield standard log achievement scores (SLAs) that would accurately summarize where students fell on the latent trait measured  by the test. These SLAs provided essentially the same information as the number of objectives mastered, with a shorter test. For most students, the items were relatively simple given student achievement levels; therefore, the amount of information provided was slight. A short, ten-item test was developed; analysis indicated that it imposed a more rigid criterion than the longer test. Mastery decisions using the short test led to 14.9% fewer Type II errors (false negatives) and 1.6% more Type I errors (false positives). (GDC)",

To assess teacher reactions to factors influencing their autonomy, 75 teachers were exposed to pressures to change the content of fourth grade mathematics instruction in a hypothetical school. Teachers were receptive to change whether the pressure came from parents, other teachers, the building principal, published instructional objectives, textbooks, or test results. Furthermore, teachers did not consider new topics as necessarily supplanting the old. Tests have an influence on curriculum because they can be viewed as concrete statements of the public's curriculum expectations. As such, tests should be  contructed so that items are written for each of list of predefined objectives. Standardized achievement tests hold students accountable for only a fraction of objectives. The promise testing holds as a mechanism for affecting curriculum depends on communicating test content. A taxonomy has been constructed to identify content differences among standardized achievement tests. As a test selection tool, it should provide an index of the relationship between test and instructional content. A sample page from the taxonomy is appended. (CP)",

It leads to a rather different treatment of the three factors just mentioned. This analysis proposes a four stage model.

        "description":"Volunteer college students were assigned to one of six computer administered vocabulary tests, one half with immediate knowledge of results (KR) after responding to each item, and the other half without knowledge of results. The six tests were designed to be at one of three levels of difficulty and consisted either of 50 preselected items (conventional testing) or tailored on the basis of previous candidate responses (stradaptive testing). Results indicated that the mean maximum-likelihood estimates of individuals' ability varied as a joint function of the KR condition and of test difficulty. Students in the KR condition scored higher than the other students on the most difficult test and lower on the least difficult test. Questionnaire results indicated that, although the  students perceived the differences in test difficulty, there were not shown to be any effects on mean student anxiety or motivation scores attributable to test difficulty alone. Students in general reacted very favorably to receiving immediate knowledge of results and its provision increased the mean level of reported motivation. (Author/CTM)",

Eighteen of these schools were studied in depth via site visits in order to provide attitudinal and anecdotal information. Graduate school deans and faculty reported that they have not received a great number of nonstandard transcripts or transcripts with nonstandard notation. Nevertheless, when such records do appear in student applications, they cause two major problems: because grades usually are not associated with nonstandard notation, grade-point averages cannot be calculated easily;  and information that explains nonstandard notation rarely accompanies the transcripts. Credit by examination, credit for prior learning, and credit for faculty-sponsored field experience cause fewer problems in the admissions process than narrative transcripts, provided the number of these credits is small and not in the student's major field. Narrative descriptions of achievement are problematic because of the lack of a comparative basis for judgment, the uneven nature of the descriptions, and the length of the reports. Survey questions and sample transcripts are appended. (Author/GDC)",

One method used data from a group of items that were common to both tests, while the other method used data from the GRE verbal aptitude test and quantitative aptitude test, also taken by both groups of candidates. The results of 158 equatings for the 17 GRE Advanced Tests were tabulated and presented graphically. Out of the 17 different test series, nine different series had equating differences at one end or the other of the  score distribution equal to about one half a standard deviation, and about three percent of the 158 equatings had differences of over one standard deviation.

Two separate questionnaires were sent to 63 deans; 60 responded to at least one questionnaire. The first involved program characteristics that indicate quality for each of the three training goals. The second dealt with the availability and adequacy of measures of these program characteristics. Data were also collected on the background characteristics of the respondents. The results indicated that the most  important criteria included: (1) faculty training, research activity/productivity, and teaching effectiveness (2) student ability before and after the program, and graduates' accomplishments; (3) financial support for the program, library, laboratory, and facilities; and (4) program purposes, courses offered, and admission policies. Ways to measure these criteria were suggested; data were provided about their adequacy and availability, and percent of administrators preferring each measure.

The TST and the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) were compared with regard to their relationships to interests, self-appraisals, and accomplishments of students during their first year of graduate work in psychology. Criterion variables were obtained from a questionnaire mailed to students near the end of the spring academic semester. Difficulties in data analysis were created both by the item-sampling character of the experimental test data, and by a relatively small rate of return of questionnaires. It is possible to show, however, that the correlations do exhibit appreciable nonchance variance with regard to consistency across tests and across  related questionnaire variables. The GRE tests were found to be more effective than the experimental instruments in predicting quality of the department attended, but the experimental tests were more effective in two other domains: self-appraisals of knowledge of psychology and skills in psychological activities; and professional accomplishments such as research, publications, and teaching.

It was found that item differentiation was generally lower for blacks than for whites; that the highest item-differentiation values tended to be for easier items; that items that  were nearly equal in difficulty for blacks and whites tended to be very difficult items; and that items with high item-criterion correlations tended to have low item-test correlations.

This multiple-choice paper-pencil inventory has 72 items in five problem areas: conservation, images, relations, classification, and laws. The test was designed to measure both concrete and formal operations for subjects eight years of age and older. This study measured the reliability of the test for groups in third grade, sixth grade, ninth grade, and college. The lowest reliabilities were found in sixth grade, the age closest to the transition from concrete to formal operations. Test validity was studied several ways. Group and individual administrations were found to  give similar results. Age trends followed expected patterns. Correlations with test scores and academic grades ranged from .42 to .87. It was concluded that this is a useful test in certain areas, and that it would be valuable to develop norms. The data were not conclusive, but it appeared that this test would also be useful with mildly or moderately retarded adults. (Author/CTM)",

Thus, tailored testing offers several advantages over traditional methods. Because individual tailored tests are not timed, anxiety is reduced and examinee motivation is improved. Economic advantages involve reduced test time, immediate availability of results, and reduced personnel requirements. Effective tailoring occurs at the item level, involving two steps: estimation of the examinee's ability from his or her previous responses, and selection from an item bank of the item likely to measure most effectively. Five methods of estimating item difficulty or appropriateness  are: (1) Robbins Monro procedure; (2) fixed step size; (3) flexilevel, which requires a smaller item pool; (4) Bayesian procedures; and (5) stratified-adaptive or stradaptive procedures.

        "description":"In this case study, the effect of the Detroit fiscal crisis on the city's public school system is analyzed in terms of the history of the fiscal crisis, the reasons for the crisis, and State, teacher, public and city reaction to the situation. The changing demography of Detroit and the events leading up to the financial crisis are described. Such factors in school budgeting as inflation, increases in staff salaries, militancy of teacher unions, expansion of social services, and a high rate of disadvantaged youth requiring special programs along with an eroding tax base are considered. Problems of inequitability of taxation are discussed in light of the social burdens placed upon aging cities. It is concluded that the major barrier confronting the Detroit school system's quest to  accumulate revenues to meet rising expenditure demands has been tax resistance by local residents and the tax revolt which has been a product of the rapidly mounting tax burden experienced by Detroit residents. Also the seeming lack of effectiveness and efficiency of school district programs has been a problem. The future of the fiscal crisis is examined and suggestions are made for finance reform in Michigan. Current State financing methods for education are reviewed. The role of the capitalist system in creating fiscal crises is stressed. Charts and tables illustrate the city's fiscal situation. (WI)",

        "description":"Over the last decade, minority firms and individuals have become increasingly more active in the process of educational research and development (R&D) activities. The future of such involvement appears to be one of continued increase, both because of the response of the marketplace and the growth in the number of firms owned by minority individuals. Such firms may be eligible to participate in special procurement programs established at local, State, or Federal levels. At the Federal level, the Small Business Administration's 8(a) Procurement Program enables firms to compete for Federal procurements on a restricted set-aside basis whereby firms are guaranteed a certain portion of the budgetary expenditures of an agency. For a firm to be eligible, 51% of its ownership must be held  by minority individuals who can prove that they are socially or economically disadvantaged. However, criteria for determining such eligibility are mainly subjective. All minority firms, whether eligible for 8(a) or not, can compete for other Federal, State, and local contracting opportunities. Recent Federal enactments have mandated that minority firms receive a certain percent of government dollars. (Author/WI)",

        "description":"Teenage and/or adolescent pregnancy is on the increase in most American cities and age of first pregnancy within this group is declining rapidly. In this study, sexual attitudes and knowledge among black inner-city elementary school students is documented. The effectiveness of a six week sex education class designed to provide these students with basic knowledge of human sexuality is evaluated by means of a modified Schiller Sex Inventory which was administered to fifth and sixth graders before and after the course. Data indicate that there was a significantly greater number of correct responses after students had completed the course. Participant involvement in the evaluative process led researchers to conclude that after the completion of the program in sex education students:  (1) developed healthier and more positive sexual attitudes; (2) had a greater knowledge of sex organs, core gender and their own sexual identity; (3) displayed willingness to approach parents about questions related to sex; and (4) increased their knowledge of birth control information and contraceptive practices.

The purpose of this study was to determine the major educational concerns of a group of twenty-five low-income black parents in the Cobbs Creek area of West Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. More than 50% of the parents agreed that their primary concerns were: (1) their children's acquisition of basic skills, (2) the employment of effective teachers, (3) their input into school programs, (4) better disciplinary procedures, and (5) the lack of homework assignments.

        "description":"The distribution of family incomes is now slightly more equal than the distribution of husbands' earnings. Movements toward equal opportunity for women are likely to have only a small effect on family income inequality. In a world with no differences by sex in work behavior, we could expect that the work experience of women and men and the inequality in the distributions of women's earnings and men's earnings would be equal. The most unequal situation for family incomes in such a world would occur if the earnings of husbands and wives were perfectly correlated. Then, the degree of family income inequality would equal the degree of inequality in husbands' earnings (which would be the same as wives' earnings). Thus, in the long run, the women's movement and attempts to equalize  opportunity by sex imply only a slight increase in the current degree of inequality even if husbands' and wives' earnings were to become perfectly correlated; under more realistic assumptions it appears that the economic advances of wives will not increase family income inequality.

        "description":"Described in this paper is a project utilizing the linkage concept in the implementation of a diffused team planning process in six elementary schools undergoing desegregation. Strategies employed in designing the project are reviewed. These reviews include a retrospective analysis of the first two years of the project, a review of the minutes of the team planning sessions, and a review of literature on diffusion. The implementation of the Linkage Model is described in terms of the following: (1) the role of the diffusion manager or &quot;linking agent&quot; in helping the participating schools develop systematic problem solving processes within the planning teams and to help link the teams to existing resources within the school system; (2) the concept of the mini-project for dealing with  a specific classroom need; (3) a training system for helping each planning team develop, implement, and evaluate a mini-project; and (4) the role of the diffusion task force in solving immediate problems, especially the resources to be allocated to the project. A conclusion summarizes the impact the project had on such factors as student achievement, the sharing of ideas among faculty, personal teaching satisfaction, responses to student attitude, conflict in the school, school morale, and resources or interference from the central office. An argument is made for the potential impact such a project might have if carried out over an extended period of time. (EB)",

Data presented show that race and sex stereotyping in television drama continues. Taken into consideration are the age and occupational status of characters and their differentiation by race and sex. Representation of minorities and women in the network news is described as being more encouraging. Findings regarding the employment status of minorities and women at television stations indicate that, despite increases in the numbers of minority and female employees  at television stations, they are almost completely absent from decision-making positions. Suggestions are made for an effective affirmative action plan in television employment. The investigation of the effects of television on children center around their perceptions of and knowledge about minorities and about sex and occupational roles as they are influenced by television portrayals of minorities and women, the influence of advertising, and the effects of television violence on their behavior. Recommendations for dealing with the findings of these analyses are made and statistical data collected for the study are appended. (EB)",

Background information on Providence is given in terms of government, population shifts, school enrollment, and school restructuring. An analysis of the evolution of desegregation in Providence deals with racial imbalance, discriminatory practices, community attitudes, magnet schools, and resistance. Basic principles of the Providence Plan are described. These include Providence's three-phase implementation, busing, funding, and staffing. Community concerns discussed range from support by the media, certain community groups, and black parents to the opposition of white parents. Problems  with discipline and racial tension are also discussed. In addition, Providence's nine-year process is evaluated on the basis of its successes and failures. Advantages cited include greater understanding among and less stereotyping of different racial, ethnic and cultural groups and a better preparation for life in a pluralistic society. Problems pointed out are the continuing underrepresentation of minority teachers in the school system, the tendency toward resegregation in the classroom, the school department's failure to maintain racial balance in accordance with state guidelines, and the disproportionate number of black students bused under the plan.

There are too many officials charged with implementing Title I who do not want to be bothered with an effective PAC. In addition, many officials do not seriously consider the experiences parents bring to their membership and do not have the skills to effectively involve the PAC. The lack of clarity about PAC's role and responsibilities, a lack of planning, a limited number of PAC meetings, and the rapid turnover in PAC membership also contribute to the erosion of parent interest. Specific actions which can be taken to stimulate and maintain parent interest include: (1) a &quot;job description&quot; should be developed for PAC members; (2) local school officials should communicate that  PAC is a valued partner in the operation of a Title I project; (3) PAC members should be encouraged to initiate activities; (4) each PAC member should adopt a specific program and follow its progression; and (5) working with PAC should be seen as a continuing process of leadership development.

Sociological aspects dealt with include the needs of education, teachers, the public and educational change and approaches to the goal of educational equality. Political concerns looked at include autonomy and control in educational renewal and accountabilitiy in education. The macro-economics of educational renewal and finance for independent schooling are two of the economic concerns  discussed. Developments subsequent to the Karmel report are analyzed and innovative programs implemented in the renewal effort are evaluated. In addition, main issues facing Australian schools five years after the initiation of the renewal effort, such as curriculum development, funding, educational goals, and the relationship between school and work, are surveyed.

This pattern is more common among blacks. Name calling, rumor mongering, body bluster, verbal intimidation, taking or destroying others' property, and physical assaults are some of the manifestations of individual and group attack. Reasons for this aggression include: (1) racism and the need to earn respect; (2) socialization to violence; (3) inadequate academic work and the need to save face; (4) responding to the self-fulfilling prophecy that blacks are more physical; (5) poor impulse control of anger; (6) sexual competition; (7) desire to test one's strength and establish  position in a peer hierarchy; (8) peer pressure; and (9) desire for attention. &quot;Meddlin&quot; occurs more in the classroom than the playground and also in the hallways and especially the bathrooms. Both blacks and whites are targets of aggression and most fights are intra-racial. The long term negative consequences of &quot;meddlin&quot; outweigh the positive gains in self-esteem sometimes made by individual aggressors. (Author/EB)",

        "description":"A comprehensive career education project in Maine was conducted on three levels: university/college-based activities; public school activities, K-12; and state department-based activities. The major objective for level I was to demonstrate to teacher educators and teacher trainees the philosophy, methods, and objectives of comprehensive career education. The major objective for level II was to demonstrate a comprehensive, integrated, and coordinated career education program in one local pilot school system (Bangor, Maine). The major objective for level III was to demonstrate procedures for initiating a Maine State Plan for Career Education. (Activities on each level are summarized by sub-objectives in this final performance report.) Evaluation plans for the public school  activities utilized a pre- and posttest control group design. Several instruments were used to measure K-12 students' self-awareness, career awareness, educational awareness, decision-making skills, and appreciations and attitudes. The statistical treatments used to analyze the data were analysis of covariance, variance, and t-tests to determine if there were significant differences between the control and experimental classes (intact classes were the analysis units). (The evaluation plan is described in detail in this document; overall evaluation results are reported in CE 019 321.) Numerous related materials are appended. (BM)",

(An earlier volume published eight similar area studies on the transition from federally centralized to decentralized manpower programs.) Written by resident field researchers familiar with the local scene, these reports span a range of experiences - from well-run operations to one on the verge of dissolution because of interjurisdictional tensions. The reports are approximately twenty pages in length and summarize how local governments administer employability development and public service employment programs. The governmental units and locations are as follows: Capital Area Consortium, Texas;  Calhoun County, Michigan; Orange County Consortium, California; Kansas City-Wyandotte County Consortium, Kansas; Topeka-Shawnee County Consortium, Kansas; Phoenix-Maricopa County Consortium, Arizona; Lansing Tri-County Regional Consortium, Michigan; St. Paul, Minnesota; and Cleveland Area-Western Reserve Manpower Consortium, Ohio. Specific topics covered include (1) pre-CETA services; (2) the clientele served; (3) relationship with other state and local agencies; (4) assessment of program effectiveness; and (5) the planning and administration of Titles I, II, and VI. While problems, such as piecemeal planning and difficulty in arranging on-the-job training, are discussed, the overall tenor of the studies is positive, reflecting progress in coordinating local program operations.

        "description":"The same techniques of behavior modification that can be used by teachers to manage student behavior in the classroom can also be used by supervisors to alter the behavior of teachers. In both cases, it is necessary for the supervisors and teachers to focus primarily on the individual's behavior itself, rather than on what causes that behavior. To modify behavior, the teachers and supervisors must determine what response or type of behavior they wish to reinforce in the individual. The two types of response conditioning used to produce behavior modification are respondent conditioning and operant conditioning. Operant conditioning examines the relationship between an individual's behavior and his environment and attempts to understand the behavior through knowledge of the factors  that modify the behavior. Both positive and negative reinforcement are used in operant conditioning to produce the desired behavioral response. Two other methods that teachers and supervisors can apply are (1) shaping or successive approximation, which is used to create a behavior that does not exist or to strengthen one that is not apparent, and (2) contingency contracting, which requires the teacher or supervisor to make a contract with the student under which rewards are promised in return for desired learning behavior. (Besides numerous quotations in the text, from behavior modification literature, a substantial bibliography is provided at the end for further study.) (ELG)",

(See CE 019 623 for the performance report.) Based on the project's final evaluation, the following general conclusions were drawn: increases in career education knowledge can be attained via planned inservice training programs; materials for inservice training must be appropriate for public school and postsecondary personnel (materials for the latter are not readily available); and local site idiosyncrasies, distant communication problems, and overcommitment by the testing organization may be  a hindrance to local staff. Some of the findings concerning the activities in the Bangor public schools include the following: test scores indicated that students who attend career education-infused courses demonstrated greater gains in self-concept, career maturity, and improved attitude toward school; teachers produced acceptable career education-infused curriculum units after training; and inservice training must be planned, sequential, and evaluated if impact on school curriculum is to occur. Some of the findings concerning university-based activities are as follow: seminar content should be based on carefully designed conceptual models if they are to be accepted by postsecondary staff; university/college role in career education is open to varying interpretation; and  university/college-based professionals were not enthusiastic about visits to public schools to observe career education in action.

To accomplish the goals, inservice hands-on clothing services  workshops were planned and conducted for forty home economics teachers. Teaching materials were developed or procured by the project director and instructor. Instruction included job survey and analysis techniques. Classroom discussion covered twelve topics, including the history of power sewing and job possibilities. Teachers were involved in individual hands-on projects and three field trips to expose them to career opportunities in the sewing industry.

Since 1977, almost 1,000 people in thirty-three communities have participated in local work-education councils affiliated with the national Work-Education Consortium. On the average, the councils consist of twenty-three members representing community leaders and program directors. The success of such collaborative efforts depends on the presence of the following fundamentals: leadership, representation, responsibility, understanding, resources, and independence to assess their own needs, priorities, ability to initiate actions, and proper timing for changes. Unlike the needs and priorities of federal and state programs  which are mandated, those of local councils are selected to suit their specific situations, and vary from emphasis on data collection (to aid in developing local awareness and understanding of youth transition issues) to the provision of accurate and up-to-date career information for youth. Eight of the thirty-three councils represent rural areas and, with the assistance of the National Manpower Institute, have formulated a charter of ten major propositions to improve rural youth transition. As communities, in general, build on this charter and the other fundamentals of collaboration, they will achieve greater influence in shaping education-and-work policy for youth transition. (ELG)",

        "description":"The state of the art of career education for handicapped persons was reviewed beginning with the events and developments which have aided in the growth of career education for the handicapped since 1971. Specific career education needs of the handicapped were identified, and the concept of career education was clarified. The study examined relevant research on the roles of occupation, citizen, family, and avocation associated with persons who are deaf, hard-of-hearing, blind, partially sighted, crippled, health impaired, mentally retarded, emotionally disturbed, learning disabled, or multi-handicapped. Research conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of various curricular approaches in this field was also studied. Finally, research in the areas of teaching counseling methods and  career assessment, exploration, and preparation for the handicapped was reviewed. The research indicated that only now are school systems beginning to retool and initiate a comprehensive array of services: infusion of total school resources, community participation, and family involvement. Based on past research and reviews of research in progress, ten generalizations were drawn. Three are as follow: (1) the majority of handicapped students who leave school are in danger of becoming either unemployed or underemployed in later life; (2) currently there is considerable curricula variability in scope and sequence for career education program implementation, but more definitive guidelines and procedures are necessary upon which to build curricula; and (3) parents appear to have a significant  influence on the handicapped person's career development.

        "description":"Recognizing the importance of a curriculum that facilitates the acquisition of desirable, affective work competencies (work attitudes, values, and habits) as well as specific job skills, a study was conducted to review and synthesize what is known about the social and psychological aspects of work and to identify specific affective work competencies that are desirable and common for vocational education programs. The literature review focused on the historical and theoretical perspectives which relate to understanding the behavior of individuals and groups; it also examined the empirical data related to affective work competencies identified by employers, educators, and experienced employees. Based on the combined investigations conducted by industry and education, a variety of  affective work competencies was identified. A synthesis of forty-two affective work competencies identified by industry with the fifty-four identified by educators provided a total of sixty-three unique, identifiable affective work competencies. However, the study concluded that there is a lack of continuity between educational institutions and employing organizations; consequently, some of the affective work competencies identified by educators have been inconsistent with what industry wanted or needed. Moreover, the inability of researchers to identify and objectively measure affective competencies was found in both industry and education, indicating a need for the development of reliable, valid, and objective measuring instruments. Recommendations and guidelines for an affective work  competencies inventory are provided. (BM)",

These documents were prepared by state departments of education and directors of FY 1974 and 1975 projects funded through the Vocational Education Research Program under Section 131 of Part C of the Vocational Education Act of 1963. Criteria for the components of a CCGP were established with the aid of a consultant panel. Findings from the analysis included the following: (1) none of the documents contained all the CCGP components, but all the components were represented in the documents collectively; (2) the components of &quot;Evaluation&quot; and &quot;Goals and Objectives&quot; appeared most often in all documents; (3) the components of &quot;Research  Provisions&quot; and &quot;Information or Communications Networks&quot; appeared least often in state documents; (4) the components of &quot;Program Planning and Program Management&quot; and &quot;Information and Communications Networks&quot; appeared least often in Part C documents; and (5) Part C documents mentioned culturally diverse and special groups more often than state documents, though the percentage was still very low. The analysis led to eight major conclusions and ten recommendations for the improvement and strengthening of career guidance around the following needs: information exchange; sustained technical assistance; program development, demonstration, and research; guidance personnel development; and the possibilities for facilitating cooperation and coordination among the different administrative units  involved in CCGP.

The primary purpose of this study was to describe and interpret the influence of the OSS Modules on the attainment of occupational survival skills and attitudes toward employment by selected cooperative office occupations students, special needs students and Comprehensive Employment Training Act students. Students were selected as intact classroom groups. Data from classroom observations and interviews with participating teachers and students were collected during a fifteen-week period. Opinionnaires were completed by teachers and  students at the conclusion of the fifteen-week period to provide both quantitative and qualitative summary data. The Occupational Survival Skills Information Test and the Career Maturity Inventory Attitude Scale were administered to the students in each program group at the conclusion of the fifteen-week period. The variables of amount of work experience, work plans, and educational plans were found to bear significant relationships to attainment of occupational survival skills. Significant relationships were found between students' attitudes toward employment and the variables of grade level, sex, work plans, and educational plans.

Major objectives are defined: (1) to raise the audience's knowledge/awareness level concerning major hazards associated with potentially poisonous household products, (2) to point out primary hazard patterns associated with ammonia, aspirin substitutes, over-the-counter antihistamines, the petroleum distillates, and (3) to inform, educate, and effect behavior changes in the audience about proper selection, use, storage, disposal, and emergency procedures related to these products. The guide is divided into seven sections; section 1 describes the contents of each chapter. Chapter 2 contains basic information on accidental poisoning and  poison prevention related to children age five and under. The third chapter provides tools to help the leader identify group concerns and needs. Chapter 4 contains a sample text of opening comments for the leader's presentation. A series of activities designed to help group members become aware of potential poisons in the home and develop behaviors to prevent accidental poisoning are suggested in chapter 5.

        "description":"Because each year hundreds of thousands of children under five are poisoned by common household products, this book is designed as a resource of activities and guidelines for teaching poison prevention to older siblings. The book states three major objectives in teaching seventh through ninth graders: (1) to increase students' knowledge of hazards associated with potential poisonous household products, (2) to inform students about hazards specifically associated with ammonia products, aspirin substitutes, over-the-counter antihistamines, and petroleum distillate products, and (3) to educate students in the proper use, storage, and disposal of potential poisons in the home. The book is organized into four chapters. Chapter 1 offers suggestions on integrating poison prevention into  subject areas. Chapter 2 entitled \"Assessing Needs and Interests\" seeks to help teachers gauge students' initial level of awareness of poison prevention and to identify specific interests. Basic information on potential poisons and poison prevention is provided in chapter 3. The final chapter presents a series of activities in poison prevention and suggests ways of selecting and implementing activities. A list of supplementary materials and sources available is provided in the appendix. (For the dicussion leader's guide see CE 020 045.) (CSS)",

The instructional units are intended to be configured in a variety of ways in order to accommodate the range of interests and experience levels that characterize individuals seeking motorcycle instruction. Six specific courses are identified: basic on-street, basic off-street, comprehensive improvement, on-street transition,  and off-street transition. It is reported that the instructional program, developed from the specifications by the Motorcycle Safety Foundation, was pilot tested on forty-eight students and revised to reflect experiences gained during the pilot test.

Taken into account are interrelationships between the nature of the organization, characteristics of subordinates, leadership functions required of supervisors, and values and assumptions about the world of work held by supervisors. This two-day training program is designed to provide new and would-be supervisors with a theoretical and practical framework to help them understand the concepts of supervision and leadership in work settings. It should also provide trainees with fundamental principles and considerations for helping employees to improve their knowledge  and skills in working with people. Training includes identification of: a personal theory of supervisory behavior; a practical basis for acting; implementation strategies and techniques; and supervisory performance evaluation methods. Training methods include: lecturettes, self-assessment exercises, group exercises, role play situations, and films. (Author/JLL)",

        "description":"Effective birth control is needed to combat adolescent pregnancy which is a major health and social problem, the adverse consequences of which have been well-documented along a variety of dimensions. A significant obstacle to the provision of birth control services to teenagers is the belief that such services will encourage adolescent coital activity. The validity of this belief was studied by a longitudinal study which assessed teenage sexual behavior prior to and one year after obtaining oral contraception. Almost all the young women were coitally experienced when they first came to the clinic for birth control. During the year the young women used oral contraception, they showed a very moderate increase in frequency of coitus which was not accompanied by an increase in their  current number of sex partners. Given the opportunity to obtain prescription contraception, these adolescent women demonstrated good continuity of usage. These results, considered in conjunction with other research, support the conclusion that providing teenagers with effective birth control will not markedly increase their sexual activity. (Author)",

Students filled out a Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) as part of an introductory course requirement. Males and females who scored as either androgynous or stereotyped were selected for four targets: mother, father, male best friend, female best friend. Some results were that: (1) androgynous persons disclosed more, (2) no sex main effect was found, (3) androgynous males disclose more on intimate topics to their fathers, (4) androgynous persons disclose more on imtimate topics to both best friend targets, (5) androgynous females disclose more on non-intimate topics to their fathers than do stereotypical females. The data suggest that self disclosure is a function of sex role and not of  biological gender. The greater predictive value of androgyny over gender supports the major assumption that self disclosure is a function of sex role socialization. (BN)",

Attitudianl information was obtained from interviews with the occupants of 4,866 housing units. Because relatively few Houston residents regarded crime as the single most important community problem, the threat of criminal victimization did not strongly influence personal lifestyles, mobility, and decisions relating to the acquisition of a home. Some 85% of the population rated the performance of the local police as no lower than average. Issues of environmental quality, economic and housing conditions, and personal convenience far outweighed  concerns about crime. Most residents believed that crime had increased, particularly outside the neighborhood and at the national level. Many people, especially women and persons age 35-64, believed that their chances of being criminally victimized had risen. Women, members of the black community, and persons who had been victimized tended to be more likely than others to think that crime was up; that crime was worse than reported; that parts of the metropolitan area were unsafe; and/or than police performance was below average.

Conclusions include: (1) Information obtained through victimization surveys is sufficiently similar to that reported to police so that most crimes are classified the same way by the two sources of data; (2) The survey data  contained higher estimates of the dollar loss from the crime; (3) The reliability of validity of the survey data depended upon the type of information considered; (4) For most of the types of information considered, accuracy or completeness did not decline as a function of the time lag between occurrence and interview; (5) The age of the victim was not related to the amount or type of error in the data.

The report identifies potential problems in the conduct of program evaluation so that they can be anticipated, assessed and prevented. Pitfalls in interpreting data for alternative policy purposes are examined. Concerns to be addressed before data collection begins are analyzed to minimize impediments to a successful  evaluation. It is noted that during the data acquisition and data analysis stages, certain interpretational problems must be considered -- including potential difficulties of transferring programs to new environments or of expanding programs. The final stage of the evaluation cycle is discussed in terms of converting problems into products. The report includes a bibliography, and technical discussions of variables, correlation, and experiments appear in the appendices. (Author)",

        "description":"There is evidence that anticipating continued performance at a task can enhance one's need for control, and will thereby influence the kinds of attributions that are made for one's performance. Causal attributions for performance in an introductory psychology course were examined with respect to students' estimates of the likelihood of their taking similar courses in future. Attributions to ability were more negatively correlated with future performance likelihood for unsuccessful (students receiving a final grade of C or less) than for successful (A or B) students. In addition, unsuccessful students tended to say that they had worked less, the more they anticipated future performance, while successful students said they had worked more, the more they anticipated future  performance. Results can be interpreted in terms of the \"controllability\" of the two causal factors, effort and ability. (Author/BN)",

It is proposed that social scientists abandon traditional research models of the school desegration process, and instead attempt to observe and characterize the situational factors which elicit both continuing and classroom-related achievement motivation in minority students. Particular attention should be focused initially upon teacher attitudes and behavior, and upon other classroom factors which affect students' choice of comparison persons and attributions for academic success and failure.

A correlated T-test between parental ratings before and after group involvement indicated significant subjective positive changes by the parents, while no significant changes occurred among the control group. Additionally,  teachers rated children whose parents attended the group sessions more positively in overall classroom behaviors whereas control group children's ratings were unchanged. (Author/HLM)",

To study this phenomenon, a social exchange model was applied to a sample of couples planning to marry to assess the predictive validity of a measure of positive exchange. The longitudinal design of the two-and-a-half year investigation provided direct information about the development of marital distress which was unavailable from previous cross-sectional studies. Study results indicated that the more positively couples rated their early interactions, the higher their relationship satisfaction was likely to be at the final followup. The social exchange model proved to be a useful model for understanding the development of marital problems, but limitations regarding its testability must  be recognized and rectified. The implications of the study for the marital interactions are discussed, as well as implications for developing programs designed to prevent marital distress. (Author/PRK)",

Included were indices of diagnostic severity; overall health/sickness; psychotic, neurotic, affective, schizophrenic or suicidal symptomatology; and reported distress. Neurotic and affective symptomatology and overall health/sickness were most highly related to self-derogation. These findings point to the need to recognize and treat low self-esteem in psychopathological states other than depression.

Clients who read this manual showed significantly better maintenance than did those not using the manual. Study 2 compared the effectiveness of the manual alone with that of a paraprofessional-administered program. Both groups showed substantial improvement, with no significant difference between groups; however, differences that did occur favored the bibliotherapy group. Study 3 was a demonstration of the feasibility of a group educational format in  controlled drinking therapy. Study 4 compared bibliotherapy with one group and two individual treatment approaches. All groups showed significant improvement, again without between-group differences. Bibliotherapy clients in this study, however, showed the least favorable outcomes. Study 5 compared an expanded form of bibliotherapy with a straightforward behavioral approach and two multimodal approaches offered by papaprofessionals. All groups showed significant gains, with bibliotherapy clients showing the least absolute improvement. Clinical issues in the use of self-help therapies are discussed. (Author)",

        "description":"Hitherto, theories of similarity have restricted themselves to judgments of what might be called literal similarity. A central thesis of this paper is that a complete account of similarity needs also to be sensitive to nonliteralness, or metaphoricity, an aspect of similarity statements that is most evident in similes, but that actually underlies metaphorical language in general. Theoretical arguments are advanced in support of the claim that metaphoricity can be represented in terms of the relative degrees of salience of matching (or matchable) attributes of the two terms in a comparison. A modification of Amos Tversky's (1977) account of similarity is proposed. The implications of this proposal for similarity statements are discussed, along with implications for the  psychological processes involved in their comprehension. It is argued that the general account of similarity proposed, including, as it does, nonliteral similarity, can not only form the basis of a theory of metaphor, but can also give a credible account of the relationship between metaphor, analogy, and similarity.

        "description":"Following a discussion of the differences between oral and written speech, this paper examines the act of reading written speech and the role that contextual information plays in reading comprehension. It notes the interaction that occurs between reader and text, points out the way in which written language makes demands upon readers' extralinguistic information, presents H. P. Grice's Cooperative Principles regarding ways a speaker (writer) is expected to cooperate with a listener (reader), and explains the &quot;Given-New Contract&quot; of Herb Clark and Susan Haviland, which governs the way in which speakers present information that listeners do or do not know. It then demonstrates that textbook content has a Given-New pattern and reports the results of a study that revealed that both  IQ and knowledge of concepts assumed by a textbook passage to be Given information correlated significantly with reading comprehension. The paper concludes from the study that reading comprehension is dependent not merely on the text but on the transaction that occurs as a result of reader information meeting author information, and it reports on other research providing evidence for this conclusion. It also notes the differences between &quot;real&quot; reading comprehension (a thinking transaction with a passage) and &quot;unreal&quot; reading comprehension (a literal level translation) and urges secondary teachers to teach reading as a thinking process and to set purposes for reading.

        "description":"In this report, three theories of transitive inference are compared as they apply to the solution of linear syllogisms: a spatial theory, a linguistic theory, and a new mixed linguistic-spatial theory. Each theory is expressed in terms of an information-processing (flow chart) model and a mathematical model that quantifies the information-processing model. The results of four experiments testing the mathematical models for their ability to account for latency data are reported, and it is shown that they overwhelmingly support the mixed theory. This support holds over varied modes of problem presentation, adjectives, sessions, and subjects. The duration of each component process in the mixed theory is estimated, and its contribution to total solution time is assessed. Then the  mixed theory is shown to account for most patterns of individual-difference data. Finally, the theory is shown to be consistent with a variety of data obtained in previous investigations of transitive inference. (Fourteen tables are appended.) (Author/MAI)",

Because it is difficult for deaf persons to grasp abstract concepts in print, high-interest reading materials intended for them require clear simple language structure and numerous photographs for visual clues to meaning. In this project, a survey of student interests revealed that the students preferred books about monsters, famous people, familiar topics (farm life, local history and geography), and motorcycles. In compiling books on these topics the project personnel faced the problems of obtaining printing rights for  copyrighted materials, the time involved in securing permission for materials, and effective printing at a minimal cost. While the project was successful in that it produced a number of high-interest low-vocabulary books that stimulated student interest in reading, negative criticism surrounded the poor pictorial quality, the use of illustrations rather than photographs, and the unattractive bindings of the books.

In addition to the yearly income lost by these males (which amounts to 175 million dollars), and the related loss of 19 million state tax dollars each year, this low level of education presents other serious problems for the entire state. Besides the lower income levels and reduced job opportunities for the individuals involved, a low statewide level of education results in decreased voter participation, increased welfare costs, poorer civic involvement in politics, higher crime rates, and the related costs of maintaining law  enforcement and criminal justice systems. Since the average cost of adult basic education is approximately $600.00 per person, using tax dollars to reduce illiteracy is both economical and practical for all concerned in that education solves the problem of economic self-sufficiency at the same time that it positively affects the educational levels of future generations.

Subjects were randomly assigned to read either a narrative about a trip to a restaurant or a parallel narrative about a trip to a supermarket; they then took the EFT and a vocabulary test, after which they recalled the passage they had read. Previous research had shown that, since the &quot;foods purchased&quot; component of the restaurant schema is more highly constrained than that  of the supermarket schema, the former supports greater food item recall. Analysis of the results showed that high and low EFT scorers (with variability attributable to difference in verbal ability statistically removed) recalled food items equally well from the supermarket passage but that for the restaurant passage, food item recall increased radically compared to the supermarket passage only for the higher EFT scorers. It was concluded that the low EFT scorers were unable to capitalize on their prior knowledge to increase their recall of information from text. (GT)",

        "description":"The phonological information provided by written words may be used by the reader as a convenient temporary storage medium and as a way of gaining access to the lexicon. Beginning readers should be able to exploit the sound-based patterning of the orthography in reading single words and to bypass it on occasion. Some words do not conform to English spelling-to-sound rules and must be read by sight. This also allows for fluent reading since the reader need not stop to sound out each word. However, this strategy places an enormous burden on the child's ability to memorize word shapes. Access to the lexicon by the phonological form of a word exploits the rules governing the relationship between orthography and sound. However, for a beginning reader, application of sound-spelling  rules is time consuming, and beginning readers may not have sufficient awareness of the structure of words. Some research in phonological processing by beginning readers indicates that the use they make of phonological representation differs between good and poor readers. Also, a relationship between linguistic awareness and the ability to read isolated words has been shown. Third, reading skill and experience are related to skill in accessing the phonological form of a word. (TJ)",

Following a clarification of the concept of influence and its relationship to the levels of analysis used in the taxonomic structure, the paper describes the following eight hierarchical levels, ordered from the molar or societal level to the molecular or individual level: societal level influences, industry level or interorganizational relations, supraorganizational influences, community or market influences, intraorganizational influences, formal or informal group influences, the influence of dyadic communication, and intraindividual or cognitive level criteria. It then argues for combining  several levels in the design of research, points out the necessity of questioning whether normative social influence operates to constrain decision making in a particular situation, and outlines a procedure that involves taking each pair of adjacent levels in the hierarchy and questioning whether normative influence operates between levels in such a way that decision making at the lower level is constrained. It also points to a promising procedure for engaging in an active search for between-level influences. (GT)",

        "description":"At Michigan State University, a &quot;hands on&quot; approach to the advertising campaigns course has proven successful. The course is limited to 25 students who work in groups of five to develop and prepare an advertising campaign for a client who has agreed to provide information and funds for the course and who in return will get a plans book and recommendations from each of the groups. The teacher acts primarily as a consultant to each group, meeting with them separately throughout the course. A major problem was that the quarter system did not allow enough time to investigate and fully develop a campaign for the clients. It was decided to combine the advertising campaigns course and the advertising research course into a two-term sequence. This allowed students to develop a strong  research base, to pretest creative approaches, to produce more creative campaigns, and to rehearse their presentations. The extended course also permitted better financing of the projects. This approach has worked well for the department, for students, and for the clients. (TJ)",

It indicates that the old-fashioned values concerning thrift; the need for human community; the rewards of love, marriage, and fidelity; the spaciousness of the globe; the proper content for English; and the fitness of public education have dwindled in importance as technological and social changes have produced previously unthought of changes in human lives.

Individual responses indicated the numbers and kinds of people (acquaintances, casual friends, close friends) with whom the subjects communicated, as well as the degree to which the subjects communicated with those people. The following conclusions were reached: (1) A positive relationship exists between the length of immigration history of ethnic groups and the amount of ethnic individuals' inter-ethnic communications. (2) A negative relationship exists between the length of immigration history and the degree to which ethnic individuals interact with members of their  own ethnic group. (3) The more an ethnic individual participates in intra-ethnic communication, the less that person will participate in inter-ethnic communication. (4) An inverse relationship exists between levels of friendship and degrees to which ethnic individuals participate in inter-ethnic communication. (5) An individual's acculturation (degree of interaction with host society instead of own ethnic group) needs to be understood within the social/cultural contexts functionally significant to the individual's daily life.

Granted that the philosophical congruity involved in such a choice guarantees a level of compatibility between the textbook and teacher, the use of text material must be consistent, well structured, and integrated into the course to permit its inclusion. Likewise, the needs of the students must be considered when judging the textbook's readability and appeal. The integrity of the instructor is most important in confirming ethical behavior; if the students feel that the course is well planned and that the instructor is dedicated to communicating with them, they will not readily oppose the  adoption of the text for use in class. A possible aid to determining whether a text should be used in a particular course would be the establishment of a board of review that would rate materials according to the currency of the material, the depth and thoroughness of coverage, the overall value or worth of the effort, and the way that the material compares with other material selling in the same market.

Section 1 draws attention to the variety of terms and contexts used in the literature on educational knowledge utilization and draws distinctions between three widely used terms: knowledge utilization, knowledge transfer, and planned change. In section 2, general orientations toward change are examined from a variety of perspectives. In section 3, seven widely quoted &quot;systematic&quot; models of change are reviewed in terms of their implications for linking agents, macrosystem linkages, linking roles, and temporary and permanent linking systems. In sections 4 and 5,  recent conceptions of linkage and linking agents are examined and comparisions are drawn among the linking agent roles described in the literature. In section 6, directions for future development are suggested. The implications of previous conceptualizations and the suggested future directions for linking agent training and support are discussed in section 7. (Author/IRT)",

With few exceptions, most of the instruments were designed for specific, often one-time, purposes. Linking agent assessment is primitive. Would-be users of assessment instruments should not expect to find much that is immediately usable here. Still, some of the available instruments can be adapted to fit linking agent training situations. Before the instruments are examined, the types of uses and methods that could be employed in linking agent assessment are  reviewed. The instruments included are Baker's School Counselor Attitudes Inventory; Davis's Linker Performance Inventory; Creighton's Professional Preference Census; Hood's and Blackwell's Development, Dissemination, and Evaluation Diagnostic Instrument; and the American Society for Training and Development questionnaire &quot;What Do Training and Development Professionals Really Do?&quot; (Author/IRT)",

        "description":"Several important issues relating to teachers and labor relations stood out in 1977-78. By the end of the year, a proposed merger between the two major teacher unions appeared remote. The National Education Association (NEA) added 100,000 members in 1977. The NEA lobbied in favor of legislation creating a separate Department of Education but the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) opposed it, and the bill died before congressional adjournment. The AFT fought against tax credits for private school tuition and proposed several options for dealing with reduction in force. Heading the list of developments in bargaining was the continuing pressure for citizen involvement. It was revealed that teacher salaries in states that have no public employee bargaining law on the books have  risen faster than those in states with such laws. Economic issues remain number one on the minds of most teachers, followed by the issues of proper class assignment and class size. The tenure system was given a boost by two U.S. courts of appeals decisions. New federal legislation clarified pregnancy disability benefits. There were four major legislative actions affecting the relationship between public employers and teachers, including the Tennessee Education Professions Act and Wisconsin's limited right to strike amendment. Also included in the document are examples of union promotional material. (Author/JM)",

It also gives the actual committee on conference report as well as reports of the House labor committee and the Senate human resources committee. In its introductory explanation, the booklet discusses the most publicized features of the amendments--the increase in the age limit on coverage from 65 to 70 and the prohibition against mandatory retirement based on the age of employees below the age of 70. Finally, it discusses procedural changes in the act that affect not only the method by which the act is enforced but also what remedies an aggrieved person may seek. It concludes that under the new standards, employers will need to evaluate all of their employees,  young as well as old, to avoid charges of age discrimination. Applying these new standards to all of the employees could lead to the termination of more younger employees than would have been the case before the age act was amended. (Author/LD)",

        "description":"This paper describes research that attempted to discover and describe the socialization process in school administrative careers that support or hinder women's decision-making for a career in school administration. After a theoretical framework was set up, twenty-five successful women administrators were interviewed and the data were analyzed. One contribution of the research was a description of female career-role strain. Another contribution was the conceptualization of the progression in women's careers from culturally defined roles, through transition, to self-defined roles and delineation of the processes whereby women are denied equal access to informal socialization. The result was a model of career progression that emphasizes the importance of the transition period for  women who aspire to or who fill higher positions in school administration. (Author/LD)",

        "description":"The educational administrator must often straddle the gap between empirically sound and politically expedient decisions, employing policy assessment as a hedge against adopting ill-conceived policies. The resource allocation model (RAM) attempts to remedy this dilemma by tying program evaluation and policy analysis into a single conceptual yet practical framework for incorporating evaluation data in the assessment of policy issues. The identification and weighing of system demands is the focus of the first component of the allocation model. For this, administrators use the needs assessment survey sheets, code sheets, and score sheets provided. The second level of the model requires use of the program implementation inventory sheet to examine current system programs and plans. The  third level of resource management involves assessing program effectiveness using the program outcome inventory sheet provided. The fourth and final phase of the model allows the policy-maker to synthesize information concerning the effects of previous policy decisions on the system's internal and external environmental components. For this phase a program decision worksheet is provided. (Author/JM)",

The agencies involved were the U.S. Office of Education and the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration. Data were collected through interviews with key informants in the agencies and project directors, examinations of files, and nonparticipant observation of program-related events. Organizational theories and anthropological models were used to analyze the largely ethnographic data. Findings indicate that both agencies had common broad social goals in working with troubled youth. Necessary elements in collaboration referred to as the &quot;transactional model&quot;  facilitated the program design and operation of the agreement. These included field-based readiness for the program, power and authority of the chief administrators, a transactional style of organizational management, frequent contacts between the key actors, and power and viability of the Student Initiated Activities Model. A number of other specific findings and recommendations resulted from the study. Recommendations included the formation of an interagency committee, encouragement of replications of the program, and clearer definition of the project director's role. Researchers concluded that the success of the interagency agreement was documented. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"As one considers the almost incredible array of guidelines, regulations, requirements, and contract provisions affecting the allocation of the local school's resources, one must wonder how it is possible to conduct the business of the school at all. Time is not traditionally considered a resource, and local school administrators are rarely trained in using time resources well, particularly in the scheduling and rostering process. This is unfortunate, since teachers' work time is the resource most clearly under the administrator's control, and may also be the most significant educational resource when used well. This document provides a brief overview of the local school administrator's role in resource allocations, from the standpoint of one administrator in the Philadelphia  public school system. Financial and regulatory constraints and the problems of central office control are touched on. Appendices illustrate documents used by Philadelphia's local school administrators in school-level budgeting. (Author/PGD)",

Teachers in 27 schools received questionnaires and interviews every six months for two and one-half years. The results showed that conventional schools did not restrict female access to influential positions anymore than multiunit schools did. In both types of schools, the more ambitious females were more satisfied with their jobs, engaged in more communication, perceived themselves as more influential in the school, and were regarded by the faculty as influential. Those in the the multiunit schools became influential for different reasons than those  in the conventional schools. The team leader position became a significant influence opportunity for the more ambitious females. (Author)",

Test results showed, based on a recommended level of 20 parts per million (PPM), that 7.2 percent of the buses tested exceeded this level, and 5.4  percent of the buses tested had maximum CO readings above 50 PPM. Recommendations included (1) development of advisories for concerned state, local, and private school bus agencies defining necessary maintenance and inspection procedures that will reduce or eliminate the CO intrusion problem; (2) promulgation of a standard defining maximum allowable CO levels for school buses; and (3) additional CO testing under controlled conditions and with an expanded data base.

Specifically, the paper explores some of the issues involved in using a participant-observation field research methodology in studying major policy issues reaching from the top to the bottom of  the MOE hierarchy. The paper stresses the importance of such activities as (1) being sensitive to the subtleties of the ideal/real dualism, (2) responding to the Latin American concerns of academic colonialism, (3) beginning study at the bottom of the hierarchy (local school level) and working upwards, (4) shifting from a sustained to a transitory methodology as the researcher moves up the hierarchy, and (5) looking for similarities and differences between selected regions or states in order to get closer to a national perspective.

        "description":"This document discusses the site histories and summarizes the reports of the participants of the East Hartford, Connecticut, and New Hampshire voucher planning projects during 1973-76. It discusses the voucher concept, which is to give parents a direct role in education, and compares the two voucher models. A summary of four viewpoints held by participants in the experience concludes the report. The ultimate irony of these two experiences, the paper states, was that the voucher system never stimulated much interest or involvement on the part of parents. However, the projects raised many questions about public school funding, accountability, and efficiency. The document states the hope that the records of these experiences will stimulate modifications in educational delivery  systems, even if education vouchers are never fully implemented or tested.

Specific recommendations are suggested for hastening the advance of primary prevention programs including that programs include preparation for parenting of all adolescents in normal school settings and that families and children be  considered as a unit.

Fundamental concepts in pharmacotherapy are reviewed, including dosage adjustment and side effects, and a brief introduction to the different kinds of drugs is presented. Research investigating the effects of stimulants (Ritalin, Dexedrine, and Cylert) on activity level, perceptual-motor skills, learning performance, behavior problems, and school achievement of hyperactive children is reviewed. Nonstimulant drugs occasionally used in the treatment of hyperactivity are also mentioned, and the Feingold diet and behavior modification are briefly described. The various  types of epilepsy are examined, along with the drugs used to treat them. Also covered are febrile seizures, the management of seizures in the classroom, and how antiepileptic drugs can affect classroom performance. The use of major tranquilizers in the treatment of behavior disorders associated with mental retardation is described. Other topics covered include the use of psychotropic drugs in the treatment of enuresis, school phobia, cerebral palsy, and childhood psychosis.

Data on the four letters are presented separately for two experiments. Results from both timed and untimed experiments are said to provide persuasive evidence that, in general, the reversal errors made by the Ss were easily manipulated. Findings are explained to support an educational rather than neurological explanation for reversals. Persistence of reversal problems is traced to assumptions by  educators that the errors are neurological in origin and that direct intervention is unwarranted. (CL)",

The Bender Gestalt Test, used in psychoeducational evaluation to determine eligibility for special education placement, was administered to determine Ss' level of visual motor skills. Rural slow learners performed significantly below their mental ages more frequently than urban slow learners. Rural and urban slow learners performed developmentally below chronological ages (CA), but similar to mental ages (MA) until CA 10 years (MA 8 years). At this point urban slow learners appeared similar to MA expectations, but a significant number of rural slow learners performed below expectations. After CA 14 years (MA 11 years) the  differences between the urban and rural groups, however, were not significant. (Tables with statistical data are appended.) (Author/SBH)",

The use of other sources of play value, such as baths and textures of materials used in the home, is explored. The second paper reviews the considerations in choosing playground equipment, which include cost, space, users' abilities, availability, selection, and alternatives (if nothing suits). The author comments on nine types of playground equipment: swings, horizontal  ladders, whirls, sand areas, climbers, balance beams, swinging bridges, slides, and tunnels; and presents a matrix to facilitate correct choice of equipment for individual needs.

        "description":"Student participation in educational planning is important for the child, his parents, and teachers. Parents are often reluctant to inform their children when they are in academic trouble, either because they fear their child will lose self esteem or won't understand the information, or because partners often want to avoid the issue. These reasons for not sharing educational information with a child are usually well intentioned but may hurt, rather than help, the child. When honesty is absent children often sense the truth and are confused, sometimes feeling that a subject too taboo to be discussed must indeed be awful. Teachers are sometimes unwilling to take on a task they feel is rightfully the parents' responsibility, and feel caught in the middle. Experience has shown that  when children are told openly of their educational problems they generally respond initially with silence, but later are able to open up and discuss future plans to remedy the problems. This involvement gives the child an opportunity to see that the situation is not hopeless and that he/she is not blamed. Often the children themselves come up with some of the best solutions to learning difficulties. (PHR)",

The mini course approach was selected as it is of short duration and is widely preferred by teachers. Among arrangements which must be made in preparation for the mini course are conducting a needs assessment, selecting instructors, and making plans for follow up on program participants. Priority was given to teachers in the eight countries surrounding the university which sponsored the program. Courses were held for regular educators and support personnel and also for paraprofessionals. Competencies, related to such areas as assessment  techniques and remediations programs were selected. The courses ran for 2 weeks with a minimum of 48 hours of instructional supervision required for course credit. The instructional design followed a diagnostic, prescriptive, teaching-involvement, evaluation approach. Post test assessment of the participants' attitudes found that their attitudes were more favorable toward the handicapped following the course. (Author/PHR)",

Findings further indicated that there is a high degree of clarity about what constitutes mainstreaming at the preschool level. With regard to social interaction, both groups (handicapped and nonhandicapped) had friends in both  groups, and nonhandicapped children rarely ignored their handicapped peers.

The Network was designed to demonstrate those practices which resulted in the provision of effective services to special needs vocational education students within the least restrictive environment. A major goal of the program was the collection, coordination, production, and dissemination of information throughout a statewide inservice approach. A number of barriers were encountered, among them, failure to carry out the requirements of the individualized educational plan, lack of inservice education programs, and communication barriers between  vocational educators and special educators. Among the techniques used to weaken the barriers was formation of an Inservice Steering Committee (composed of a special educator, a vocational educator, an administrator, and other related support personnel) in each school district responsible for the planning and delivery of an inservice program representative of the views of each specialty area.

The results indicated that the issues most likely to surface during the collective bargaining process are: teacher involvement in the planning of policies and procedures which affect their classrooms, and class size, that is pupil/teacher ratio. The overwhelming concern for involvement in decision making may indicate that the classroom teacher feels the locus of control is not within the classroom. Both structural and behavior solutions to these two major  concerns of teachers are possible. Among the structural strategies available for handling the concerns are manpower adjustments, staff development, and innovative and flexible staffing patterns. The behavioral strategy calls for the establishment of a task force to deal with the issues and concerns. (Author/PHR)",

A closed format type of questionnaire with 111 items was used. The general conclusions drawn in the major areas studied were: (1) although use of English was primarily for international purposes, some English was used for intranational purposes; (2) reasons for studying English and the skills preferred overwhelmingly indicated instrumental rather  than integrative needs; (3) if these students are representative of other groups and countries, the future growth of English to meet the development of a world society and international market seems to be a certainty; (4) expansion of English will be further aided by decolonization and indigenization of English, as it becomes less a symbol of imperialism, and more a valid candidate for an international language and a local language for intranational purposes; and (5) English is being accepted as the country's own language with native varieties and teachers.

        "description":"This study examined the psycholinguistic implications of using either of two different types of orthography--syllabic and roman--in Native language programs for Cree children with regard to readability, learnability, and the transfer of reading skills to and from reading in an official language (English or French). This study can also be applied to Ojibwa and Montagnais languages, which share structural features and orthographic problems with Cree. Elementary school children in Ontario of Cree background were studied both through limited research conducted on a psychological level and more broadly through reading instruction classes in bilingual education programs. While the orthographies of the official languages represent a more abstract level, both types of Cree orthographies  tend to represent the phonemic level and generally operate similarly. Results show the following differences: (1) it may be easier for very young children to manipulate syllables rather than phonemes; (2) words written in syllabics may be shorter and less complex than those written in the roman script; (3) certain grapheme reversals may cause more problems for learners of syllabics than of the roman system; and (4) if students are going from one orthography to a different type (syllabics to official language and vice versa), they will have to learn new materials and concepts. However, if the transfer is made from a Native roman orthography to an official language or vice versa, the risk of confusion of the two systems is much greater. Implications for further research are discussed.  (Author/MHP)",

The selection process, teaching methods, and the \"exit test\" are described and a discussion of the adequate and inadequate aspects of the course is given. The entry tests were in spoken English, grammar, and listening comprehension coupled with written production. During the course two teachers were involved, one generally presenting the material and the other facilitating group discussion. Films, slides, articles, closed-circuit television, language laboratory sessions, and personal tape recorders were used extensively along with teacher-directed private  study. At the end of the course, the test of spoken English and the listening comprehension test, administered on entry, were given. A third test was added to measure oral fluency based on activities of the course. Evaluation of the course revealed a noticeable inadequacy in the ability of students to read a paper or present material from private notes. Although proficiency in listening comprehension, oral production, and limited written production all showed improvement, it was indicated that higher standards might be reached with the use of more course-specific materials. Several recommendations are provided in the light of this pilot experience. (AMH)",

        "description":"The study of pidgin and creole languages, usually emphasizing oral language codes, offers insights into language, especially as an observably dynamic phenomenon. However, channel is highly influential on the surface form of the language code. Pidgin sign language codes, not dependent on oral language codes, can serve as an ideal forum for the discussion of universality and uniqueness in pidgins and creoles. Code structure of these pidgins is relatively unexplored and the channels of the pidginized languages heavily influence surface code structure. One pidgin sign language, Pidgin Sign English (PSE), has developed out of the U.S. sociolinguistic situation of the deaf community where communication is necessary between the deaf and the hearing. PSE comes from American Sign Language  (ASL), which is channeled through the manual-visual modality, and English, channeled through the oral-aural modality. Several grammatical, functional (phonological), and linguistic characteristics of PSE can be discussed, such as: (1) the progressive aspect; (2) negative incorporation; (3) agent-beneficiary directionality; (4) copula; (5) the perfective aspect; (6) articles; (7) plurality; (8) number incorporation; (9) phonology, especially suprasegmentals; (10) handshapes, places and movements; (11) the written language; (12) reduction and admixture; (13) restricted inter-group use; and (14) the relationship of these areas to a dynamic theory of pidgin and creole languages. PSE may serve the vital function of fostering development of the deaf subculture with minimal long-term cultural  interference from the hearing community. (Author/MHP)",

        "description":"It is possible to communicate effectively in a second language in spite of highly deviant pronunciation and grammar as long as messages are semantically coherent and message forms are reasonably appropriate. Until now, research in second language acquisition has focused principally on the processes through which non-native speakers move towards native-like grammatical competence. However, there has been little study about how and why non-native speakers learn to say what is appropriate and socially correct in their new language and speech community. The present study is concerned with the insights that the theory of speech acts can contribute to our view of second language acquisition by examining the use of English directives by non-native speakers. Data sources include  questionnaires given to speakers of English in service encounters, journals, and interviews. Because social blunders are considered embarrassing, excuses for them are often offered rather than explanations, although mother tongue interference is considered at times. The data gathered for this study indicate that transfer is not the only factor that accounts for differences between native and non-native use of directives. Learning and communication strategies similar to those identified for the acquisition of grammatical competence are at work in the development of communicative competence as well, and individual second language learners vary considerably in the strategies they use.

In addition to contrastive analyses, the project has also included error analysis, textbook analysis, and the study of certain aspects of language acquisition. Early phonological studies of the project have been different from the traditional  framework of contrastive analysis. More recently, traditional contrastive analysis has been expanded to include contrastive discourse analysis. In this phase, the language user's communicative competence as a whole is the object of study, and attention is paid to all linguistic, psychological, and sociological parameters that are involved in the communication process.

Contrast is made to English orthography, an example of an inconsistent spelling convention. Weak points of Finnish orthography, especially as regards children's learning of reading and writing, are considered. Cases where the spelling of Finnish deviates from its \"convergence to pronunciation\" concern those cases where there is linguistic information in speech that cannot be conveyed by writing  or where writing does not display all the phonological variations in the language. The adoption of many foreign words wherein the relation of letters to sounds deviates from the native system, is described.

The verbs are divided into three main categories: verbs expressing the faculty of sight, perceptional seeing, and intentional seeing. Within these main categories, the verbs have been further classified into subcategories on the basis of their semantic properties. All of the Finnish subcategories of perceptional seeing have corresponding categories in English. One  category which is not represented in the Finnish field concerns the idea of failing to see something.

Results from a related evaluation study are also presented. The study was undertaken because of the unsatisfactory development of foreign language teaching and learning among the students of the University of Jyvaskyla whose main subjects were other than foreign languages. The foreign language teaching of the faculty is analyzed as a hierarchy of goal setting, methods planning, and evaluation. Four subsystems were identified: the foreign language examination board, the faculty of the social sciences department, the teacher, and the student. Three approaches to goal setting were considered: a  trait-referenced approach, text-referenced approach, and needs-referenced approach. Instrumental objectives in reading comprehension of a foreign language text and measuring comprehension are discussed. Results of the first trial of the reading comprehension course are examined. The evaluation of the course focused directly on the student's subsystem (learning results, appropriateness of the needed initial level in English, and coordination of the course with the rest of the study program).

        "description":"This reader, intended for use in a bilingual education program, tells the story of the Indians' struggle to keep their land along the St. John River during the American War for Independence. Written from the Indian point of view, the text is based largely on the journal of John Allan, a white man living in Nova Scotia, who was sympathetic to the American cause and friendly to the Indians. The narrative tells of the efforts of John Allan to get recognition of the Indians by the American Congress, the differences of opinion among the Indians themselves on the advisability of helping either side, and the battle at Machias in which the Indians forced the British warship &quot;Hope&quot; to leave their territory. The text is in English with the exception of one account of a conversation around  a campfire when the native Indian language is also used. The illustrations are pen and ink maps and drawings by the students at Indian Township School. Also included are excerpts from original historical documents and correspondence related to the subject matter. (AMH)",

        "description":"It is contended that there are such things as discourse blocs, and that they are composed of discourse units glued together into a contextuated whole by bloc signals. There are three kinds of structures with which it is necessary to deal in order to discuss coherent discourse: the discourse bloc, the discourse unit, and the bloc signal. Characteristically, a discourse bloc has a stated or implied topic. Topic, whether stated or implied, has a set of characteristics which may be preliminarily identified. Topic is likely to be either definite or generic. While topic often occurs as a complete sentence, it may also occur as a left-dislocated sentence modifier. It is also possible for the topic to occur in direct object position or in the position of postponed subject when subject  position is occupied by some mechanism for permitting the subject to be moved to the right of the verb. Four types of definiteness noted by Hawkins are: anaphoric, immediate, occurring in a larger context, and associative. It is likely that all four types also occur with respect to the definite topic. Topic also has a logical function and a discourse function. Implications for language teaching, particularly in the relatively new areas of scientific and technological discourse, are noted. (SW)",

After stating ten assumptions on which a bilingual education program is based, the guide focuses on program implementation, the undergraduate, masters and doctoral programs, and an overview of degree programs. For each level, the attitudes and skills to be developed are described as well as linguistic, cultural, and pedagogical competencies. The competencies, sequential in nature, are of two types: (1) the basic type with minimum requirements  that will allow the individual to perform effectively as a bilingual education teacher or as a specialist in some other branch of bilingual education; and (2) supporting competencies, that is, those which serve to enhance and strengthen the preparation of the degree candidates. The section on degree program overviews shows graphically the approximate ratios between basic and supporting competencies, and among the various subcategories of supporting competencies.

The number and distribution of women in psychology was considered, and their participatory activities in the American Psychological Association (APA) were examined. Employment and salaries were investigated, as were the barriers to obtaining a doctoral degree. The results show that the situation for women in psychology may be in a period of transition. There are greater numbers of women in graduate school, more recent female Ph.D.'s, and in both cases, a higher percentage of women than in the past. Affirmative action and the availability of employment has served to block obvious discrimination in new hiring. More women are involved in the governance of the APA. However, the data still  indicate that the longer women are employed the greater is their disadvantage. Many recently hired women have not received tenure. It is concluded that attempts to reduce existing discrimination, especially in academe, must be continued. (Author/MSE)",

This approach makes two assumptions: that a faculty member's market value can be determined and that it is independent of local labor market conditions. Several thousand faculty members in the social, biological, and physical sciences and engineering who had changed jobs since 1970 were surveyed in 1977 to identify the causes of immobility and those psychic benefits that were important in faculty moves. Geographical preferences appeared to be more important than salary in mobility decisions. In terms of actual job changes, there seemed to be some tradeoffs of salary for other desirable job traits. High levels of institutional prestige, opportunity for creativity and  scholarly pursuits, and autonomy are characteristics for which faculty members will sacrifice income. They will require higher salaries if smaller amounts of these traits exist. In most cases, desirable jobs provide both high salaries and large amounts of nonmonetary benefits. (SW)",

More women and blacks are reported to be studying business, and women are enjoying a seller's market upon graduation from business schools. There is an increase in cooperative education programs, workshops, and internships. Programs in southern colleges and universities are briefly described. The question of whether business education should emphasize knowledge itself or practical skills is addressed. The establishment of new schools of business in the South is  also discussed. A Southern Regional Education Board Study has found that in addition to the liberal arts, the fields of education, law, and communications are being edged out of the traditional college job market.

A correlation matrix was computed for the items based on individual student responses. Factor analysis, a principal components solution followed by a varimax rotation, of the correlation matrix, which yielded an orthogonal solution, was carried out. The evaluation instrument also included five items designed to provide information about a student's perception of  his or her affective growth. Results confirmed that by the end of the quarter, students' evaluations of instructional effectiveness were positively related to their achievement in the course. Ratings on the evaluation dimensions &quot;concern&quot; and &quot;examinations,&quot; as well as on the overall instructor rating item, bore the strongest relationships with students' positive cognitive outcomes.

The fundamental policy issues, rather than strictly economic issues, are the focus of attention. The most obvious challenge to existing policy has been support for the tuition tax credit, which is in effect a federal scholarship awarded without reference to financial need. It is suggested that support for need-based aid is waning on campus as well as in government. With the recognition that financial need formulas were based on arbitrary and debatable judgments came experimentation with the components of the Basic Opportunity Grant formula to increase aid going to middle and upper income students,  and a growing sense of unease in the student aid community regarding the credibility and public acceptability of financial need analysis. There also has been the question of whether parents should be responsible for paying college costs for their children in light of the fact that a number of students are claiming financial independence from their parents. The prospect of declining enrollments in the 1980s poses another challenge to existing student aid policy, since colleges will be influenced by the financing policies of state and federal governments. A few predictions about policy issues are offered. (SW)",

        "description":"The forces or pressures that have produced a concern for fundamental skills of literacy are briefly considered, and a number of related questions are raised about willingness and capabilities for dealing with the issues in a deliberative, systematic manner. A major premise is the belief that the back-to-basics movement can be understood best in terms of the requirement of minimal competency testing in public schools by state legislatures and the current concern for basic academic competencies in general education at the college level. The back-to-basics movement implies a pervasive belief that the status of literacy in the 1970s is deplorable. The following questions or issues are discussed: (1) What is the evidence for a decline in literacy? (2) Can everyone in a pluralistic  society master common reading, writing, and computational skills? Is it desirable that they do so? (3) Can schools and colleges actually teach reading and writing? Do school and college faculties have the resources, methods, and capabilities to actually do so? (4) Is there any genuine evidence that colleges can do what schools have obviously not done? Problems involving minimum competency tests are briefly discussed. It is concluded that the challenge to schools and colleges is to define or refurbish a workable concept of functional literacy in a democratic society with many pluralistic features. (SW)",

The teaching consultant works with the instructor to collect information on classroom performance. Review and discussion of the information provides the instructor with insights into his teaching which may assist him in making improvements. The teaching consultation process includes an assessment of teaching, improvement efforts, and a final review. The process begins with a personal interview followed by classroom observation, videotaping of classes,  obtaining student opinions through administration of a questionnaire, and completion of the questionnaire by the instructor himself. After the instructor determines where to attempt improvements in his teaching, the consultant and instructor work collaboratively to design and test ideas or strategies. Near the end of the semester, the instructor and consultant recollect information about his teaching to assess his progress and to determine whether additional improvement efforts are needed. (SW)",

The objective of the study was to identify those characteristics, components, and elements that should be common and essential to any postsecondary institution and program, and to frame them into a single taxonomy. This model may provide for consistency in developmental (internal) and evaluation (external) processes. A great deal of latitude is provided the institution and its personnel in applying the model. The classifications consist of institutional characteristics  (purpose, sponsorship, students, faculty, degrees offered, student costs, and financial data) and program characteristics (purpose, curriculum, faculty, delivery system, learning methods, admission requirements, completion requirements, advanced standing processes, advising, evaluation systems, learning resources, and costs), which may be identified as either traditional or nontraditional. A mathematical formula is applied to the classifications, and the result allows the user to place the institution on a traditional-nontraditional continuum. The bulk of the report consists of profiles (derived from the taxonomy) of 62 institutions used as models in the study. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"The Strengthening Developing Institutions of Higher Education Program--under Title III of the Higher Education Act of 1965--is evaluated. The program is intended to assist institutions struggling for survival and isolated from the main currents of academic life. More than 800 institutions had participated in this Office of Education (OE) program from its inception in 1966 through fiscal year 1977, and appropriations had exceeded $700 million. Many institutions could qualify for Title III grants, but most grants have been made to small institutions that serve primarily minority and low-income students. While the program has made many worthwhile services possible, the OE could not show how these services have moved the institutions closer to the main current of American higher  education. After 12 years, no institutions have graduated from Title III. There are no indications that any will soon graduate, even though 120 of the institutions that received funds in 1977-78 had been in the program for at least 8 years. HEW told GAO it does not believe the law implies that institutions must achieve independence from the program. It is recommended that HEW direct the Commissioner of Education to: (1) provide Title III grantees with more specific guidelines on requirements for conducting program evaluations; and (2) design a better system for monitoring external evaluation reports. HEW responses are reported. Appended are a glossary, a list of institutions receiving grants in 1977-78, HEW comments, and a description of the Strengthening Developing Institutions Program  reprinted from the &quot;Federal Register.&quot; (Author/MSE)",

Selected databases were expected to vary widely on several dimensions.

The instructional material was divided into four lesson segments, each followed by a review segment. Students who failed to reach the criterion score for any review segment repeated the corresponding part of the lesson, and a criterion test was administered at the end of the last segment. Measures of student performance used during the course of the instruction were (1) the total score on the criterion test, (2) the number of errors made during the lesson and review segments, (3) the percentage of responses made during the lesson and review segments that were incorrect, (4) the time required to complete the lesson and  review segments, and (5) the number of review segments failed. Although the attitude pretest did not correlate with any of the performance measures, a correlation was obtained between attitude posttest and percent errors. Attitude change was correlated with total score, errors, and percent errors. Attitude and attitude change were not related to student ability. Appendices include summaries of the pretest and posttest results. (Author/CMV)",

The present state of telecommunication needs and opportunities in metropolitan areas and potential urban applications of telecommunications were examined in light of rapidly evolving technologies and the relative economy of telecommunications. Four major advances in technology were identified as likely to lead in the near future to significant changes in metropolitan telecommunications: increasingly capable terminals, software controlled networks, cellular mobile communications,  and fiber-optic cables. Telecommunications applications are considered in such areas as business aids, reference sources, entertainment, government administration, the environment, health, education, welfare, emergency and mobile services, and citizen safety. Within each of these areas telecommunications were reviewed in their capacity to improve efficiency and reduce costs, increase timeliness and accessibility of information, and facilitate public access.

Areas included in this study are delivery of public services to the home, operation of mobile public services, personal security networks, and energy conservation and management. Major recommendations include the establishment of a pilot program to demonstrate the ways in which telecommunications can help deliver public services to the home and the nationwide implementation of 911 service, by legislation if necessary. Because the uses of mobile radio for delivering public services are many and varied, it is deemed unlikely that any single mobile system approach will  provide a universally appropriate solution; however, it is recommended that some preliminary experiments with community security telecommunications networks be carried out. Several peripheral but potentially significant applications of telecommunications in energy conservation and management are indicated: substitution for travel, transmitting demand and providing information between consumers and utilities, and facilitating the marketing and transfer of bulk power.

        "description":"This assessment of ten existing academic library instruction programs in the United States and Canada investigates administrative and staff support, instructional methods, and program impact as an aid to writing a guide to academic library instruction programs. A representative sample of ten library instruction programs was selected on the basis of: (1) geographic area; (2) size of the academic institution; (3) type of academic institution; (4) library instruction methodology; and (5) duration of program. Programs were evaluated through personal interviews with administrators, library staff, faculty, and students as well as appraisal of instructional and orientation information. Program statistics and cost information were also reviewed. Administrative, faculty, and library staff  were found largely to be only partially involved with the programs and this partial involvement extended to program administration by public or reference services librarians. Instructional materials and methods varied widely and differed with respect to institution size. The formulation of objectives, record of statistical data and periodic program evaluations were found to be important in program organization. (CWM)",

To make such systems possible, technological advances in multibeam spacecraft antennas, low cost earth stations, large satellite power systems, high speed spacecraft communications switches, and spacecraft supporting technology may be required. The committee concluded that the technology to meet such needs is often not provided by the private sector because of the technical and cost risks involved, and therefore suggests  that there is an appropriate federal role, and that NASA should resume the research and development activities needed to provide the new technology.

In addition to the services directly related to users, the instrument provides for evaluation of administrative  services and code compliance. Some collection techniques are suggested, but centers are encouraged to explore other techniques or to consider application of needs assessment-evaluation techniques already in use. The instrument is designed for internal evaluation followed by external evaluation. For the on-site visit, external evaluators are divided into three teams of one or more persons each; one team assumes an advocacy role, one an adversary role, and the third the role of overall evaluator.

The first variable tested the hypothesis that selection of number of examples according to on-task information is more efficient than selection according to pre-task information or pre-task plus on-task information. Data analysis showed that the on-task information condition needed significantly less instructional time and fewer instructional examples than either of the other two conditions. The second variable contrasted response-sensitive strategy with a response-insensitive strategy to determine the presentation order of examples within rational sets. Results showed that students in the  response-sensitive group not only performed better but also needed less on-task learning time and fewer examples than the response-insensitive group.

One component of the program is the Directed Independent Study (DIS) program which provides an alternative to classroom instruction in Arithmetic, Introduction to Algebra, College Algebra, and Trigonometry. After a testing procedure to determine course of study and preferable learning mode, students are guided by a computer through a program consisting of 12 performance-based units of instruction. Success rate for DIS students during the 1974-75 academic year was about 40%; it rose to 50% for the 1975-76 academic year and continued rising until 1977-78 when a Tutorial Study Lab was added and the success rate dropped. The number of  students involved in the program rose from seven to 44 by 1977-78. Another increase was found in the number of student visits or contacts, computed daily, weekly, and monthly. Students showed a clear preference for individual tutoring, however, attempts have been made to limit tutoring and increase usage of less popular modes of instruction. Though there was a slightly higher percentage of minorities attending the Center than in the total student population, the profile of DIS students is fairly well representative of the student body.

        "description":"Members of the Council of Universities and Colleges present recommendations and practical strategies in the area of curriculum development in this monograph. Louis Bender discusses strategies for curriculum revision. James Wattenbarger and Sandra Scaggs relate organization theory to the process of curriculum change. Raymond Schultz and Carl Webb offer a curriculum evaluation model. Paul Starnes and Fred Wellman recount ways in which the various state agencies influence curricula. Several authors discuss the process of curriculum formation in the context of specific programs. Richard Richardson, Jr., Mike Svaco, and Stewart Rooth present a case study in career education. Sig Rislov shows how the community college president should talk with industrial leaders in order to better  shape curriculum. Richard Rinehart describes the process of defining goals. Other authors consider ways of formulating plans for general education. James Hammons presents the results of a survey asking deans how they perceive general education. Walter Hunter offers arguments in favor of a competency-based general education program. Al Smith and Janette Martin argue for developing the integrated teaching of values. Arthur Cohen discusses issues in curriculum formation for the 1980's. Andrew Hill contributes an annotated bibliography. (Author)",

        "description":"Because of a growing community of non-English speakers in British Columbia, there is an urgent need for effective teaching programs in English as a Second Language (ESL). Non-English speakers frequently face educational deprivation, difficulty in using their skills and in finding employment, dependency on government assistance, and, if children, disadvantages in entering the school system. ESL services have been provided on an ad hoc basis. ESL services should be expanded and equitably distributed to meet identified needs. Each institution that offers ESL programs should have a core of full-time, trained instructors. Pre- and in-service training including adult education and community practice should be available for teachers in the public and private sectors. A special ESL  curriculum should address individualized instruction and independent learners. Outreach programs such as industrial English and Open Learning Institute distance programs should be developed to improve access. A central resource center should provide for the development and exchange of information and materials, and for pre- and in-service training. Funds should be provided to meet the full costs of adult ESL programs in colleges and school districts, including costs of identifying needs, developing programs and curricula, instruction, assessment, support services, and evaluation. Discussions and data related to specific recommendations in these areas are provided. (Author/AYC)",

        "description":"By means of an extensive literature review, this paper attempts to determine what should be taught in a community college writing program with a diversity of students in a sequence of developmental and transfer English courses. The existence of a laboratory and separate reading courses is assumed. The paper begins by citing studies of the appropriateness of behavioral psychology and objectives, cognitive psychology, and developmental psychology to teaching writing. Next, the social value of writing is considered to place into context an attempt to define writing competence. Components of a writing program that would help students gain this competence are suggested. Subsequently, more specific questions are addressed relative to who the students are, how they learn, and what and  how they should be taught. Although techniques are not presented, except as examples, experiential assignments are favored as motivators of thinking and communication; and a performance-based modular plan is suggested and its practical applications discussed. A section is devoted to comparing error analysis and presentation of grammar as teaching methods, which concludes that error analysis is more likely to lead to good writing. Finally, the process of teaching writing is examined. A bibliography is included. (Author/MB)",

These three degrees, plus an associate of general studies (A.G.S.) and an associate of occupational studies (A.O.S.) degree, and certificates for students completing programs not leading to an associate degree were recommended, with content requirements, for approval by the Colorado State Board for Community Colleges. The proposals and the designations and standards that were actually adopted by the Board are provided in this document, which also presents a definition and rationale for general education.  According to these standards, A.A. and A.S. programs require 45 quarter hours of general education credit and are intended exclusively for transfer to baccalaureate programs; A.A.S. programs require 18 hours of general education credit and are intended exclusively to prepare students to enter full-time skilled and/or paraprofessional occupations; A.G.S. programs require 24 hours of general education credit, and that each student develop and meet objectives; and A.O.S. programs require 90 quarter credit hours and standards require that each program offer adequate preparation for job entry.

Data indicate that the number of transfers increased from 1976 to 1977, but decreased from 1977 to 1978. Males typically outnumbered females. Racial distribution remained relatively stable, though the percentages of Blacks and Hispanics steadily increased and the percentages of Whites slightly decreased. The mean age of transfers remained stable over the three-year period; however, the percentage of transfers under 31 in 1976 dropped from 88.4 percent to 86 percent in 1977. The greatest percentage of students (44.9 percent in 1976 and 42.7 percent in 1978) were in their first year of study. The largest group each year transferred after  earning 90 quarter hours at the community college, utilizing the community colleges extensively to complete lower division course work. Most students transferred to the university nearest their community college and, while there, most (85.2 percent to 90.3 percent) earned a grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 or higher. Additional tables present the number of hours earned toward a degree at the community college and at the university and GPA data for various subgroups--those transferring before or after earning 90 quarter hours, those from each campus, those with different majors--over the three-year period.

Three groups of students were randomly chosen: (1) the control group--used programmed texts and received instructor and peer assistance during class; (2) an experimental group--used programmed texts supplemented by videotapes; and (3) a non-control group--used programmed texts, received instructor and peer assistance, and used the tapes if they desired. Course grades, unit test scores, and scores on the Mathematics Opinionnaire, which  measured enjoyment, motivation, importance and fear, were used to evaluate student achievement. The study revealed that: the performance of students who previously studied algebra was superior; there was no significant difference in the effects of different treatments; there was no significant difference between mean changes in opinion toward math among the groups, though the overall change in opinion of the experimental group was positive and that of the control and non-control groups negative.

Observations are drawn from the literature in relation to open admissions, the extent to which minority educational needs are met, actions that would help community college programs benefit the individual and the institution, the importance of cultural awareness, and the elements leading to minority student success. Additionally, data are presented which indicate the following: two-year colleges have shown strong growth in minority enrollments, offering opportunities for study to minorities to a greater extent than postsecondary education as a whole; and there has been a marked increase in minority employment in two-year colleges, though a substantial  gap remains between minority enrollment and employment. The first of a series of commentaries is by Shirley Chisholm, who addresses the importance of community colleges for Blacks. Next, Mildred Bell describes an evolving developmental studies program; Wallace Galluzzi explores the way in which Haskell Indian Junior College (Kansas) serves the special needs of Indian students; Donald Godbold discusses the efficacy of community colleges for minorities; Hattie Jackson examines the past and future relationship of minorities and the two-year college; and Helen McLean considers definitions of minorities, barriers to postsecondary education, and program evaluation.

Near the end of the study, enrollment and performance data for students who transferred to the University of California and the California State University and Colleges were collated through 1978. The transfer study focused on: (1) student characteristics (sex, age, ethnic status, admissions and final enrollment status, and college majors); (2) performance in the community college measured in terms of persistence, credits earned, and grade point average (GPA); and (3) performance at the senior institution measured by advanced standing credit, GPA, persistence and graduation rates, and major. Findings indicate that the overall, gross  transfer rate was less than 15%. Of the transfers, 58% were men, 73% were under the age of 20 when first enrolled, at least 63% were not from an ethnic minority group, and most came from the more traditional persisting groups of community college students. While 53% of the transfers had GPA's of 3.0 or better before transfer, about 40% of the State University transfers maintained equivalent GPA's. The California community colleges seem to have become bifurcated institutions: traditional two-year colleges with programs leading to degrees for transfer, and postsecondary institutions for older, part-time students with different objectives.

Part-time students, the underemployed, women entering or re-entering the labor force, minorities, and those seeking new careers are today's clients. During the last decade, occupational faculty have become isolated from their areas of expertise, and models for occupational faculty development programs are lacking. Hagerstown Junior College (Maryland) initiated research into staff development for occupational faculty that resulted in an innovative strategy. Using data from a survey of local industry and an experiment with one teacher conducting a training program on-site, the college obtained a grant to place, over a five-year period, all its career faculty in a  business or industrial setting to validate theory, study current practice, or apply problem-solving techniques. Criteria were developed for selection of faculty proposals to &quot;return to industry.&quot; Five, out of seven, proposals were approved in 1978. Summative and formative evaluations of the projects illustrated the validity of on-site return to industry in areas related to teaching fields. In 1979, the second year of the project, nine additional proposals were approved, so that by the end of the 1979 cycle, ten of the college's 14 occupational programs will have had a faculty member return to industry and then to the classroom.

Thirty companies which employed fewer than 500 people and which were likely to employ scientists, engineers, and technicians were randomly selected from 1,255 firms located in non-urban areas in central and northern Wisconsin. Investigative instruments included a semi-structured interview, president's questionnaire, company continuing education policy questionnaire, and a technical employee's questionnaire. Preliminary results indicate: (1) most small companies record an employee's participation in continuing education but few give formal rewards for  participation; (2) workshops, seminars, and conferences are the most likely types of continuing education to be fully financed by companies, while college credit and non-credit courses are primarily partially funded; (3) companies are reluctant to give employees released time for continuing education; (4) the most effective type of continuing education is that conducted in workshops, seminars, and conferences, while correspondence courses are least effective; and (5) presidents of corporations and employees indicate continuing education is important in improving job performance but not in personal development.

Surveyed institutions include accredited junior and community colleges; multipurpose, technical and/or vocational schools and institutes; university branch campuses; and proprietary schools. During 1978-79, total enrollment for reporting institutions was 3,548,000, a decline of 1.7% compared to the previous year. This followed increases of .4% in 1976-77 and 2.7% in 1977-78. Overall enrollment decreases were experienced by public, independent private and nonpublic, and proprietary institutions; junior and community colleges; and multipurpose units and university branches; while increases were experienced by church-affiliated and  technical/vocational schools. Full-time enrollment declined 5.7%; part-time enrollment increased by only 1%. The count of classified full-time freshmen showed a significant loss of 4.7% compared with the previous year. Overall enrollment of women students increased by 1%, with women accounting for 52% of the grand total enrollment. Six tables, comprising the bulk of the report, list enrollment data by institution, institution type (public, church-affiliated, independent, or proprietary), geographical region and state, sex of the student, full-time enrollment, and total teaching staff. The introductory narrative summarizes enrollment data and suggests trends and future concerns. (DR)",

The first experiment, in which 12 children were taught the concepts \"fat\" and \"skinny,\" showed that (1) explicit verbal representation of the concepts was a more effective instructional technique than formulation in terms of an extrinsic reinforcer, and (2) a variety of concrete examples has an adverse effect on learning when the number of exemplars exceeds the minimum necessary for complete logical definition of a relational concept. The second study, in which 16 children were taught the concept \"round,\" investigated the effects of different amounts of teacher verbalization and different forms of child action; none of the experimental variables significantly  facilitated learning. The third study, in which 18 children were taught the concept \"square,\" compared the effectiveness of different forms of verbal representation when combined with visual and proprioceptive feedback. The two instructional variables were number of verbal contexts and use of contrastive terms in the correction procedure. For children who had already learned the meaning of \"round,\" round-square confusions were reduced when the terms were contrasted. A contrastive term did not help a child who did not already know its meaning. Confusions between square and shapes other than round were reduced when the teacher presented the term \"square\" in a variety of verbal contexts and the child responded by using a square object in a number of action contexts.

A total of 120 children, in three age groups (6, 7, and 9 years) were given either an explication or a multiple choice task to assess comprehension of 15 novel comparisons expressed in five alternative forms varying in pragmatic difficulty: predicative metaphors; topicless metaphors; similes; quasi-analogies; and riddles. The form in which a comparison was expressed affected the ease with which it was comprehended: predictive metaphors and similes were the most difficult; topicless metaphors were intermediate; and analogies and riddles were the easiest. The order of difficulty remained constant across age. Results support the hypothesis that, at least  for metaphors grounded in physical resemblance, the ability to perceive a resemblance between elements ordinarily classified apart (a cognitive skill) is not sufficient for metaphor comprehension and that additional pragmatic skills are necessary. These results are discussed in detail. (Author/SS)",

A total of 60 children, aged 6, 8, and 10 years, were shown comic strip scenarios of four interpersonal conflict situations and asked about the characters' feelings. They then answered questions along the lines noted above about their own experience concerning those feelings. The 6-year-olds differed significantly from 8- and 10-year-olds in having fewer instances of both masked and dissimulated display usage. The 8-year-olds did not differ significantly from the  10-year-olds. Sex of subject had no significant main effect or interaction. Qualitative analyses indicated that children in all age groups were readily able to cite reasons for masking or hiding feelings; one of the most common reasons cited by all age groups was to avoid embarrassment and derision. Older children showed somewhat greater subtlety than younger children in their suggestions for dissimulation. With increasing age, children cited significantly more circumstances in which it would be appropriate to express one's feelings. Response details are provided in appendices. (Author/SS)",

In both applications, the research that was generated was usually deficient in ecological validity. In addition, in some of the research verbal self-regulation was inferred when an overt analogue--vocalizing aloud--occurred before the instrumental behavior and not when the vocalizing occurred after the instrumental behavior. The reasoning is faulty because the overt analogue could be mediated rather than mediating. A new line of research, concerning knowledge about self-regulation, is suggested. (Author/SS)",

        "author":["Iannotti, Ronald J."],
        "description":"When assessing the influence of empathy on prosocial motivation, analyzing empathy alone would lead to a misunderstanding. We must also assess other elements of the situation, such as the altruist's coping skills and situational constraints. In a similar manner empathy itself should be conceptualized as a process with many elements. One way to conceptualize these elements is to categorize them as to whether they are likely to develop in a cumulative, mechanistic, experience-dependent manner (content components of empathy) or to develop in a structural, organismic, process-dependent manner (structure components of empathy). Measures of content components show empathy developing at an early age; measures of structure components indicate continued development in childhood.  Discrepant findings concerning the role of empathy in prosocial behavior may be resolved by considering the differential development of these components and by assuming that a minimal level of each is necessary for empathy to mediate prosocial behavior. For example, low or nonsignificant correlations between empathy and altruism have been found for children less than 7 years old. From 7 to 8 years and on, around the time Selman's stage II level of perspective-taking is achieved, significant correlations between empathy and altruism emerge. (Author/SS)",

AG was defined as a pattern of continuous growth during the previous two years in the Total Reading grade-equivalent score on the Stanford Achievement Tests. Fourth grade students from four classrooms in two elementary schools in an integrated urban school district served as the sample. High- and low-AG students were identified in each classroom. Thirty observations of four target students for 30 minutes each were made in four subject areas. Student behavior, type of academic activity, off-task activity and activity  format were coded on a minute-by-minute basis. Twenty different academic activities and eight activity combinations were identified and then grouped into 10 categories. Six off-task activity types were found. For each student observation, activity and format interruption rates, percent of time in each off-task activity type, and total time off task were determined. Among the significant findings, the high-AG students were more likely than low-AG students to go off task during creative activities. Low-AG students were more likely to go off task during recitation. High- and low-AG students spent nearly equal amounts of time off task. In the discussion of the results, several implications for educational practice are indicated. (Author/RH)",

Data were obtained through literature searches, analysis of government documents, and interviews with government service providers, legislative aides, and consumers of services. Initial conclusions from work in progress are: (1) In the field of children's social services, data compilation is approximately 20 years behind the state of the art for education, and basic data on services provided is not collected for submission to state or federal authorities in any standard format on a  recurring basis; (2) From the limited data available, the access of children to quantity and quality in social service programs varies enormously within states, with much larger variations than those discovered in the public financing of education even before the recent school finance reform movement (1968-1978); (3) Federal allocations to states for social service programs comprise a substantial proportion of state Title XX budgets; for several reasons, there is not the same degree of accountability for these funds as for federal education grants; and (4) In all three states Title XX state allocations to localities are purported to be based on need, but closer examination of the formulae and interviews with policy makers revealed that Title XX allocations are determined primarily by  political criteria.

The sample consisted of 28 dyads equally divided into groups of oral and simultaneous (oral plus manual) communicators that were matched on audiologic and demographic variables. Videotapes of free play interaction were subjected to an interaction analysis. This analysis examined behavior at the level of the dyad or interaction rather than at the level of individuals. The duration and complexity of interaction were strongly affected by both the method and level of communication. Simultaneous dyads had interactions that were longer, more complex, and  contained more cooperation and positive affect than did oral dyads. The role of simultaneous communication is discussed in terms of its benefits for both the communicative and social competence of profoundly deaf children. (Author/MP)",

Study subjects, 133 kindergarten and first grade multi-racial boys and girls, were administered the TTCT-Figural Form A and selected Piagetian tasks of conservation of number, of discontinuous quantity, of mass and of time measurement. Two assumptions were tested: (1) that characteristics of creative thinking, such as flexibility of thought and resistance to premature closure, in particular, also underly ability to conserve, and (2) that those children who attained an above average creativity index on the TTCT would be early conservers. Analysis of variance yielded significant correlations at the  .001 level that indicated that conservers were more resistant to premature closure and their thinking was more flexible than non-conservers. A multiple regression of the creativity variables that were significant as a result of canonical correlation was done to identify those useful in predicting readiness for conversation. Piaget's notion of reversibility of thought is brought into question. Conservation is interpreted as reconciling simultaneous opposites or &quot;Janusian thought&quot; taken from the creativity literature. (Author/MP)",

The book develops five major themes: (1) It views child development in a comparative fashion, examining universal sequences in development as well as the diverse behavior patterns that are adaptive in a wide variety of cultural contexts. (2) It focuses on the interrelationship of biological, ecological, and social factors that put constraints on the behavior of children and their caretakers. (3) It reveals options and problems that arise when children and their families are confronted with rapid social change. (4) It points to the practical application of cross-cultural  research in intervention programs designed to meet the health, nutritional, and educational needs of young children and their caretakers. (5) It illustrates the contributions of multidisciplinary research and international cooperation in the cross-cultural study of children and in social-action programs. (Author/MP)",

Data were obtained from 160 respondents (119 females and 41 males) from 3 geographic areas in San Antonio: the Special Impact Area of Casa Del Sol (an alcoholism program) and the cities of San Antonio and Alamo Heights. Information was gathered on the socio-geographic characteristics of the drinking places, alcoholism awareness, family attitudes and opinions about alcoholism, the consequences of alcoholism, drinking cultural patterns and values, and familiarity with Casa Del Sol. The findings included: 50% of the respondents were familiar with Casa Del Sol; 8.7% drank because of peer pressure and expectations, 30% because of personal, familial and economic reasons,  30.6% because les gusta tomar&quot; (they enjoyed drinking), and 5% for social reasons; 32% had had contact with the jail in an alcohol related issue; 31% responded that drinking was done at home after work or during weekends and 30% said drinking took place at &quot;la cantina&quot; (bar); 49% said they worried about someone who drank in the family; 34.4% defined alcoholism as an &quot;un vicio&quot; a bad vice). Since the majority of the respondents were females, four questions were analyzed to measure the difference in perception and interpretation between the males and females. The analysis showed no difference between the two groups in their responses at the .05 level of significance. (NQ)",

There were two types of independent variables: parental (residence, educational attainment levels, family income, father's occupational status, mother's employment status) and personal (sex, college classification, residence, high school type and size of graduating class, attitudes toward sex education in the schools, premarital sex, and actual premarital sexual experience. The sex role orientation scale was based on traditional Hispanic attitudes. Analytical methods used to test hypotheses were the t-test, Pearson's correlation, and multiple  regression. Hypotheses accepted included: (1) parental--student sex role orientation scores increased as father's occupation scores increased and with increased urban residential experience; (2) personal--females showed more modern sex role orientations than males, and more modern scores were related to increased length of college experience, urban residence, desire for higher education, support for early sex education, and desire for and actual premarital sex. Analysis showed personal characteristics were better predictors of sex role orientations than parental ones. (RS)",

Interviews were conducted with 533 parents across the Austin Independent School District to obtain information on job status, age, income, education, attitude toward education, amount of reading in the home, mobility, time spent watching TV, relationships with the school, and the child's preschool, day care and kindergarten experiences. Phone interviews were conducted; those parents not reached by phone were interviewed in person. The initial analysis was a summary of the distribution of the responses. Any item for which more than 90% of the respondents answered the same was not studied further. Either a  calculation of the correlation coefficients of each variable related to reading achievement or a calculation of the mean reading achievement scores and an analysis of variance was conducted for the remaining variables. Results were then merged with the achievement scores on the California Achievement Test administered the previous year. In summary, the survey indicated that for the school district, the most consistent indicators of children with lower achievement were those most &quot;traditionally&quot; used for SES--parental income, education, and job status. For identification of low SES students for Title I and other special programs, these measures would be the best single measures to use. None of the other variables examined was as consistently related to achievement. (NQ)",

Dealing with the cold successfully requires a thorough knowledge of: physiological reactions to the cold (shivering, vasodilation); fundamental laws of heat transfer; the causes and current treatments of the most common cold injuries (snowblindness, earache, dehydration, chillblains, hypothermia, and frostbite); and some specific techniques for staying warm (proper clothing properly worn, sleeping warmly, group shelters, \"huddling\"). Prior to the actual field experience instructors should alleviate fear of the  cold by talking about it; teach students about cold injury, the appearance of a healthy body, and techniques for staying warm; establish communication with the students; and conduct a preparatory overnight trip. During the field experience itself instructors should teach by example; guard against dehydration; assume nothing about a student's knowledge or ability until it is observed; transfer much of the responsibility for keeping warm and healthy to the students; and maximize successes. Evaluation of the experience will improve future cold-environment outdoor teaching. (SB)",

Activities designed to allow learning about the total environment, such as simulation games and land use problem solving, are integrated into the work program in both residential and non-residential YCC programs in all project areas. In 1977 nearly 40,000 YCC enrollees worked for an average of $540.50 to create or improve 24,178 acres of wildlife habitat, construct 796 miles of trail, aid 647,212 park and  forest visitors, thin and improve 7603 acres of forest land, and maintain 1465 miles of trails. These projects were valued at $47 million. Federal YCC funding in 1977 was $52 million. Largely satisfied with the program, enrollees' EA rose an average of 11.81% based on pre- and posttests. Among 1978 goals are better minority representation at staff levels, more effective evaluation methods, and greater emphasis on urban programs and residential camps. (SB)",

Legislation is necessary because these agencies have not corrected management weaknesses in spite of repeated recommendations by GAO, congressional committees, American Indian Policy Review Commission, and other responsible groups. Programs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and other Indian programs have been persistently weak in the areas of planning and needs assessment, records management and information systems, program monitoring and evaluation, training and technical assistance for tribal governments, coordination of federal agency activities, and staffing and funding. These deficiencies have caused rising program  costs without evidence that programs are improving the quality of life for Indians. Education and health, school construction, business development, housing, training, natural resources, and self-determination activities have all suffered. Congress should consider the following alternatives to improve Indian services and programs: (1) consolidate under a single agency; (2) consolidate program areas; (3) funnel Indian program funds through one agency; (4) assist tribes in developing the capability to manage federal programs. GAO reports on federal management of Indian programs are appended. (JH)",

The Port Administration reported a 72 percent increase in revenue compared with the previous year. The customs division entered 801 vessels, and collected exise taxes of $1,322,182. Pago Pago International Airport handled 11,992 flights and processed 77,610 inbound and 81,820 outbound passengers. Tax revenue for the year was $7.1 million; $1.9 million came from individual income tax and the rest from corporate taxes. A 1977 sample census indicated 4,166 households and a total population of 30,600. Broad areas covered in this report include general information, legislative actions, legal affairs, general government, education, medical services, transportation, and economic development. (DS)",

        "description":"Nineteen cabinet rank departments and 13 governmental agencies administer government affairs in the Virgin Islands. In fiscal year 1977 major government revenue sources included 48% contributed by collections from U.S. customs and 29% from taxes. Major expenditures were 48% of all funds going into commercial and industrial development, 13% toward education, and 12% into general executive government expenses. Tourism remained the most important industry; in fiscal year 1977 the total expended by visitors was estimated at $152 million. The population of the islands was about 100,000 with some 32,000 students enrolled in public and private schools. A downward trend is developing in public school enrollment, but overcrowding remained a serious problem, with many schools conducting  double sessions. The first section of this report gives general information on the islands, including descriptions of geography, government, finances and taxes, economic development, and population. Sections two and three summarize activities of each of the cabinet rank departments, governmental agencies, and the College of the Virgin Islands. Some of the cabinet departments include the Departments of Commerce, Labor, Personnel, and Public Works. Among the 13 agencies are the Community Action Agency, National Guard, Public Television System, Port Authority, and Planning Office. Tabular data is given in such areas as education, finance, health, law enforcement, and water and power authority. (DS)",

Major weaknesses are: the nonavailability of imput data from the listed sources; application of formulae, especially in the area of determining base and nonbase employment; technical misstatements of formulae; and limitations of the quantitative results. Data indicate the power plant and its 2500 new construction employees are likely to affect all phases of the  rural community and place intense pressures upon the units of government for additional facilities and services, resulting in temporary city and school district deficits until increased property tax revenues upon completion of the power plant can off set them. Knowledge of the relative magnitude of the power plant impacts provides local officials with a valuable planning tool. It is in this area that the &quot;Procedures Manual&quot; fulfills a necessary objective. (NEC)",

This paper analyzes the ratings of the relative importance of various stated objectives of an elementary science unit by developers, teachers, and outside evaluators. The rating system used is based on the number of activities provided in the materials, related to each objective. Results indicate significant discrepancies between the ratings of the developers and the teachers compared to the evaluators. The reason for this includes too little emphasis on the clear establishment of priorities in the development of the curriculum itself. It is suggested that teachers need to realize the importance of establishing  priorities in teaching objectives and to develop a more discerning approach in their own perceptions of priorities as ways to minimize the phenomenon.

Participants, grouped according to mathematical aptitude, were administered a mathematics confidence scale consisting of 18 problems to which they responded by indicating how confident they were that they could solve each problem if asked to do so. Then they worked on 18 similar problems and indicated how confident they were that each solution was correct. Results indicated a clear relationship between mathematical aptitude and the discrepancy between confidence and performance. The lower the aptitude, the  poorer the performance at a given confidence judgment. Estimates remained poor even after the problems were attempted, especially on complex problems. Educational implications are discussed. (HM)",

Each section begins with an explanation of the technique in that section. The readability graph developed by Edward Fry at Rutgers University is presented with directions for its use. Sample science textbook usability checklists are included with four categories that aid the teacher in selecting texts. A simplified technical vocabulary analysis chart allows the science teacher to plan for teaching technical vocabulary and skills at the same time.  Sample concept guides illustrate the technique of determining major concepts that students should acquire and listing them in short phrases. Students then can select statements which underlie the major concepts. Teachers are guided in analyzing a passage to determine a pattern of organization which supports the major concepts. Students later will be expected to indicate whether statements actually occurred in the passage and must identify the major concept supported by the statement. Samples in science comprehension and vocabulary reinforcement help teachers guide students in interacting with important technical terms. (SA)",

A specific objective of the project was to develop career ladders within Missouri's state government agencies which would increase job satisfaction and worker productivity. The document is presented in seven chapters. Chapter I introduces the project and discusses organizational problems identified in a 1976 survey of 1200 Family Services Division caseworkers and supervisors. Chapter II provides an overview of the most frequently mentioned problems, including organizational sprawl, interpersonal problems, and low salaries. Chapter III compares problems identified by Division personnel with problems  identified in a national survey of personnel in social services agencies conducted by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in 1975. Chapters IV and V analyze results of the survey in terms of 13 dimensions, including job pressure, role overload, alienations, job motivation, power, and communications. Chapter VI presents responses offered to open-ended questions dealing with improving work situations, quality of services, improving effectiveness, and making social service jobs easier. The final chapter offers suggestions for the second phase of the project. (DB)",

In this book the author examines how women's roles are changing and the impact of this change on economic and social patterns. Chapter I identifies areas in which women have already gained increased responsibility and involvement, and states two reasons for the support of women's rights. The reasons are that (1) major socioeconomics problems cannot be ultimately resolved without women's participation, and (2) equality between men and women is an integral part of the foundation for a just society. Chapters II through IX explore women's concerns in areas of legal status, education, health, mass media, politics, work, and family life.  Among the topics examined are the underestimation of women's economic contributions, effects of birth control on women's health, the increase in numbers of households headed by women, and the gap between women's formal political rights and their real exercise of political power. Chapter X summarizes the need for change in attitudes toward women as well as in concrete opportunities for more involvement by women. Although some societies are already more progressive than others in recognizing women's rights, more growth must be made on all fronts. (AV)",

Chapter two reviews requirements for replicating the NAEP assessment model so that valid data comparisons can be made. The third chapter explains how to read the NAEP survey results, the exact meanings of the column headings in the tables, and the possible percentage of error.

Procedures for determining that these values are taught conclude the document. A teacher begins at the start of the school year by formulating teaching/learning experiences to help students grow in these areas. Five questions should be answered when planning social studies lessons: What specific content will the  students learn? What skills will the student practice to obtain this information?

        "description":"This report provides information on factors that are associated with children's progress through elementary school and high school. Children's rates of advancement through school were measured by comparing the grade attended in 1976 with the typical grades attended by children at each age. The grade in which most children of a given age were enrolled was called the modal grade. Children's relative progress through school was measured by whether they were at or below the modal grades for their age. The factors related to school progression investigated in this report were sex, race, Spanish origin, language ability, region of residence, metropolitan-nonmetropolitan residence, poverty status, and educational level of family head. Analysis of survey data showed a decline between  1950 and 1976 in the proportion of persons five to 17 years old who were below the modal grades for their age. When compared with the total population, significantly higher proportions enrolled below the modal grade were found for youth who were black or of Spanish origin and living (1) in families maintained by an adult who had not completed high school; (2) in poor families in metropolitan, central cities, or nonmetropolitan areas of the South; or (3) in households in which the usual language was not English.

Using the lecture-discussion technique as the control method, two tests (the hybrid version of the Test of Understanding in College Economics and the Questionnaire of Student Attitudes Toward Economics) were used to measure the impact of the two methods of instruction. Tests were given pre-course, post-course, and seven weeks later. Four  additional data were also analyzed: level of high school training, Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) score, college course instruction method, and the instructor to whom the student was exposed. Findings showed that students with low pre-course knowledge, no previous economic training, and low SAT scores achieved a higher level of post-course economic knowledge and retention when instructed by the simulation-gaming method. The obverse is true for the lecture-discussion method. While neither method could be labelled superior, the relative effectiveness of each was dependent on certain student characteristics. When advising or assigning students to introductory economics courses, college instructors should be aware of these findings. (CK)",

        "description":"Population growth and resource depletion are discussed. The need is stressed for policy makers to understand how population projections relate to the carrying capacity of the earth's basic biological systems. Because the earth's resources are limited, it is essential that policy makers in developed and developing nations be able to analyze the relationship between population and resources such as fisheries, forests, croplands, and grasslands. Economic and social stresses have already resulted in over-fishing, over-grazing, shrinking forests, urban slums, unemployment and, since 1974, annual double digit inflation. One major constraint to unlimited population growth is the oil supply. Petroleum is the principal fuel that powers the global economy. The changing petroleum supply  necessitates not only vigorous conservation programs but also establishment of policy priorities which will assure adequate oil supplies for essential purposes such as food production. Population policies which have been devised to deal with population growth include family planning assistance and controls on rural-urban migration. The conclusion is that policy makers must devise ways of stabilizing population at a level far lower than currently projected in order to avoid deterioration of the earth's biological resource base and of the living standards of more and more people.

        "description":"The document examines the past and present functions of educational history. By focussing on the contradictions between the organization of public education and the values upon which it is supposed to rest, critical history can be the most dynamic source of educational change. In the past, history as conceived in history departments differed greatly from the history of education which was primarily written within schools of education. The purpose of educational historians was to provide inspiration to educators-in-training; these historians demonstrated how the public school idea triumphed over its many enemies. Currently, however, the history of education has emerged as a serious, respectable branch of general historical scholarship as historians have grown to understand the  role of education in intellectual, social, and cultural history. Present historians argue that the actual results of education have been different from its official goals, and that public education has contributed more to the reproduction than to the alteration of social structure. More specifically, contradictions between the schools and social order include: the contradiction between unequal education and democratic values, the continued production of highly skilled workers in a stagnant job market, and the demand for acceptance of diminished expectations confronted by a crisis of legitimacy. Since the critical version of educational history allows educators to comprehend their own experiences and to understand the reasons for apathy, hostility, and violence, the sources of educational  change must be historical and grounded in the analysis of conflict.

The traditional index--marginal probability--uses a model for the normal examinee's test-taking behavior only, based on item characteristic curve theory. The other two indices use a generalization of the traditional index which allows ability to vary during testing. One uses the standard likelihood ratio to quantify the amount of improvement of fit achieved by permitting ability to vary across items. The other index estimates the parameter values of the varying ability models, and uses estimated parameter values to indicate the degree  of aberrance. Files of candidates with 4%, 10%, 20%, and 40% aberrance were generated by modifying item scores of normal examinees. Results showed that 20% aberrance was surprisingly well detected for the suspiciously low group on all three indices. Suspiciously high candidates were even more easily detected. Results are significant because they suggest that inappropriately scoring candidates (such as low ability students who cheat or high ability students who misinterpret instructions), can be detected without reference to background variables.

Secondary uses include faculty evaluation, research, and course and instructor selection by students. Successive refinements of the original pool of 1,000 items by factor analysis and subjective expert judgment led to the current 21-item instrument with five subscales: general course attitude, method of instruction, course content, interest and attention, and instructor. Internal consistency reliability coefficients on the subscales ranged from .80 to .98. Normative data based on class means were collected from 16,000 course sections at two universities, and 6,800 sections nationwide. The data compared results of student ratings by  course level (from freshman to graduate), proportion of required enrollment, and instructor rank. The first two variables yielded significant validity effects. No normative data were provided for variables having little or no relationship to student ratings--class size, sex of student and instructor, time of day, and semester.

Then, building upon those concepts, it develops the basic concepts of item response theory: item parameters, item response function, test characteristic curve, item information functions, test information curve, relative efficiency curve, and score information curve. The maximum likelihood and Bayesian modal estimates of ability are described with illustrative examples. After a discussion  of assumptions and available computer programs, some practical applications are presented, i.e. equating scales, tailored testing, item cultural bias, and setting pass-fail cut-offs.

Pearson correlations were computed between methods (inventories), and traits (categories), to construct a multitrait-multimethod matrix, following the Campbell and Fiske model. Validity was evaluated by observing intercorrelations among cells in the matrix. Convergent validity was consistently demonstrated  for only one category--fate; discriminant validity was not evident for any comparison category across the four instruments. Rates of validity over all comparisons were 66.6% for convergent and 12.5% for discriminant. One explanation for inconsistent findings across locus of control studies is that the multitrait-multimethod matrix accounts for more variability than the categories measured.

        "description":"The questions of whether undergraduate students use different processes in evaluating their own learning in a course, and whether such differences are related to differences in personality development or cognitive development were studied. It was predicted that students possessing well developed abstract conceptual structures would show a more deliberate use of the evaluation process and a greater degree of differentiation in their self evaluation. Levels of conceptual development of undergraduates in a home economics education curriculum were measured. Results of assessing students' self evaluation, correlated with scores of conceptual level, indicated that most students' judgments were based on personal expressions of goodness or badness rather than on objective references.  Little or no differentiation was observed in their judgments, nor were conditional judgments indicated. It was concluded that educators should examine not only the content of students' self evaluations, but also the \"contexts\" of their judgments and the processes used, and that if students' evaluations are used as a basis for planning learning and instruction, this may undermine the intellectual aims of education. It was suggested that students' self evaluations may be used to aid them in developing higher cognitive and motivational orientations. (MH)",

        "description":"Three procedures used to control Type I error rate in stepwise regression analysis are forward selection, backward elimination, and true stepwise. In the forward selection method, a model of the dependent variable is formed by choosing the single best predictor; then the second predictor which makes the strongest contribution to the prediction of the dependent variable is chosen, controlling for the effects of the first variable. The process continues so that the variable chosen increases the prediction potential, until remaining variables fail to make any contribution. Backward elimination begins with a model containing all predictors; and, at each step, a variable is eliminated if its removal results in the smallest reduction of effectiveness. True stepwise procedure is a  variant of forward selection. To test these procedures, a Monte Carlo computer program, written in FORTRAN IV, was prepared. The results support two conclusions: (1) the probability of erroneously forming a regression model increases as a function of the number of predictors; and (2) as the inter-predictor correlation increases, the probability of making errors decreases. Therefore, the number of predictors and the inter-predictor correlation should be considered when attempting to solve an error rate problem. (MH)",

This paper first discusses a simple causal model; incorporating a single unmeasured variable for the purpose of exposition. A substantive example follows, incorporating several unmeasured variables for which multiple indicators were available. Joreskog's LISREL model for the analysis of linear structural relationships was used. The problem studied concerned the processes of educational attainment among several ethnic groups. The most important substantive conclusion was that measurement errors differ between ethnic groups and that ignoring errors leads to biased estimates of  structural effects. However, application of LISREL depends on the collection of appropriate data. Unless the data have been collected by appropriate procedures, and unless the model is adequately specified, LISREL is unlikely to produce definitive results. (Author/CTM)",

        "description":"Analytical strategies for examinining attitudinal data about teacher brinkmanship behavior collected in a semantic-differential format, and delineating the qualitative distinctions among types of brinkmanship behavior are suggested. Teacher brinkmanship is described as behavior which expresses dissatisfaction with facets of the roles teachers are expected to perform; this dissatisfaction is typically manifested so as not to threaten those responsible for administering the situation. Twelve types of behavior are assigned to three categories: (1) subversive or exaggerated obedience; (2) tightroping; and (3) boundary testing. The evaluation of brinkmanship is accomplished by measuring teachers' attitudes toward brinking acts of their colleagues rather than by direct observation of  teachers engaged in brinkmanship. Variations of two techniques for two-mode factor analysis, pooled R-technique and pooled T-technique factor analysis, are developed and compared. The pooled R-technique may be submitted to factor-analytic procedures satisfying any of three different objectives: reducing variables to a more manageable set; exploring the feasibility of additional attitudinal parameters; or validating the existence of a conjectured set of attitudinal parameters. When a reasonable amount of certainty exists about the attitudinal dimensions underlying the domain of brinking acts, the pooled T-technique factor analysis can be used. (Author/MH)",

DTA  consists of six phases: (1) surveying the home-family-child environment; (2) diagnosing basic skills learning difficulties; (3) analyzing and classifying learning difficulties; (4) planning diagnostic targeted assistance; (5) implementing the assistance; and (6) evaluating pupil progress and modifying the diagnosis.

        "description":"Problems and procedures in assessing and obtaining fit of data to the Rasch model are treated and assumptions embodied in the Rasch model are made explicit. It is concluded that statistical tests are needed which are sensitive to deviations so that more than one item parameter would be needed for each item, and more than one person parameter would be needed for each person. Statistical goodness-of-fit tests--based on the conditional maximum likelihood estimates of the item parameters--which can detect these two kinds of deviation are presented. Common sources of deviation are also identified, as are the tests needed to detect them. Problems in the use of statistical tests to assess fit are discussed and some investigations of power are presented. In relation to a distinction  between use of the Rasch model as a criterion and as an instrument, the treatment of the goodness-of-fit problem in different measurement contexts is discussed. Finally, it is concluded that items which can be identified as misfitting should not be routinely excluded to obtain fit to the model; instead other actions should often be taken--such as grouping of the items into homogeneous subsets.

        "description":"Members of the beta family of distributions were used to estimate percentile ranks and to accumulate normative data collected in a university-wide system for gathering student opinions about teaching--including the areas of course content, objectives, instructor's behavior, teaching methods and materials, and outcomes of instruction. The fitted distributions were found to be acceptably accurate and to provide as accurate or more accurate percentile ranks than the linear interpolation method often used for this purpose. In addition, the estimation method investigated requires storage of only minimal data in order to accumulate (update) norms from year to year. The nature of the results suggests that the beta family may be a useful modeling distribution for norms or population  distribution estimates on Likert-type items in other attitude and opinion research areas.

        "description":"Undergraduates in two experiments learned ten mathematical rules under different strategies of adapting instruction to individual needs. An adaptive model developed by Hansen was structured to use multiple predictors for two purposes: (1) to classify students into four independent learning style groups, thus allowing for group-based adaptation; and (2) to predict individual performance, thus allowing for instructional adaptation within groups. Results indicated that when the incentives attached to rules were adapted to individual subjects' predicted rule scores (high prediction = low incentives, and vice versa), retention was facilitated relative to treatments which varied incentives in a non-adaptive manner or held them constant across all rules. A more finely-graded incentive  distribution (five different levels) was more advantageous than a less finely-graded one (three different levels). Additional findings showed that the benefits of differential incentives increased when the strategy was used in combination with individualized adaptation of the quantity of support material prescribed. These strategies are valuable because they allow students the freedom to self-manage, while arranging incentives and practice opportunities so as to promote retention. (Author/CP)",

Gorham's Proverbs Test--which requires the interpretation of a proverb sentence--was administered and repeated five months later. Four questions were addressed: (1) what can the pattern of answer choice, across age, using frequencies of response as the raw data, indicate about the psychometric properties of learner development; (2) what process/product inferences might be drawn from these outcomes; (3) is the total correct score adequate for evaluating achievement; and (4) is the cumulative learning hypothesis valid--this hypothesis implies that the principal source of meaning is found in the frequency of right answers, or in interactions between right  answers. Analyses considered various interactions between two right answers, one right answer and the wrong answer in another item, wrong answers in both items, equivalent ages, and equivalent student groups. The results suggested that learning involves a complex hierarchical sequence of interactive non-linear events; analysis of error patterns is more meaningful than frequency counts; total correct scores are only adequate for evaluation of simple recall; and the cumulative learning hypothesis is not valid for complex cognitive processes.

The comparison focused upon the amount of bias introduced by Model A1 when its underlying assumptions were violated. The model assumes, first, that the local school population is accurately represented by the national norm group; and secondly, that the percentile standing of the treatment group on the pretest remained unchanged on the posttest in the abscence of treatment effect. Data were from a Model B1 evaluation--kindergarten children were pre- and posttested with the Aural Comprehension subtest of the Stanford Early School Achievement Test, while the first and second grade children were pre- and posttested with the Woodcock Reading Mastery Test. Comparison of the  three model B1 gain estimates (unadjusted, covariance adjusted, and principal-axis adjusted), illustrated the wide variation between estimates. For kindergarten groups, the adjustments were relatively modest, but for grades one and two, the adjustments caused a dramatic shift from negative to positive estimates. Model B1 (adjusted) provided much lower estimates for kindergarten and much higher estimates for grades one and two than did Model A1. Questions were raised concerning representativeness of the norm group and validity of the equipercentile assumption. (Author/CP)",

        "description":"Issues associated with the ACT (American College Testing) Assessment Program illustrate the need to assess college entrance examinations in terms of the variety of common predictive uses such as estimation of first year grade point average (GPA), or chances of obtaining a C average after certain semesters or in specific courses. Test developers should also be concerned with the diversity of groups and colleges to be tested. The problems professional schools face illustrate the need to examine the relationship between the predictor (test score) and the success factor (usually college GPA). Although tests are developed to spread students over a wide scale, professional school candidates score within a narrow range, thus affecting the predictive ability of the tests; the same narrow  range problem applies to grades. Other prediction issues should be considered--hidden variables in college admissions, use of first-year GPA as the sole criterion, specification of the measure used to predict relationships; consequences of misclassification; test bias; and inability to measure nonacademic skills. In summary, a predictive decision is practical only when its various possible uses, misuses, and relationships to ultimate goals are considered. (CP)",

        "description":"Prior research has indicated that items administered to college students for rating their instructors, can be empirically as well as logically classified on a continuum from very general to specific. Three of these hypothesized classifications of item specificity--global, general concept, and specific--were chosen to represent this continuum. Thirty-nine Likert-type items empirically identified as members of these categories, and as members of a content domain labeled influence and security, were then compared against six statistical properties: (1) skewness in distribution of class section means; (2) between-class variance of means; (3) within-class variance among student responses; (4) ceiling effect; (5) item reliability; and (6) interquartile range. Results indicated that  most items met the criteria hypothesized, although some discrepancies for the most specific items were pronounced. The differentiation among specificity levels offered an essentially content-free classification scheme. Implications were drawn for questionnaire item writing, use of results, and the evaluation of overall item quality. (Author/CP)",

        "description":"Using Glass's meta-analysis, of which &quot;effect size&quot; is the fundamental measure, 135 research studies on Ausubel's advance organizer theory were reviewed to determine its effect on learning and retention. Variables, such as grade level, subject area, organizer presentation mode, and ability level were also examined. In most of these studies advance organizers are shown to have a facilitative effect on learning and retention. Advance organizer effect on retention increases with time in relation to the control group. Learning is shown to be more pronounced in college and special education subjects than in primary or secondary school subjects, while primary school subjects show a greater retention increase. Within subject areas, average effect size of the advance organizer on  learning and retention is positive, especially in the social sciences for learning and in the physical sciences for retention. For subjects of high ability, the average effect size exceeds that for low ability subjects. Aural mode advance organizer studies show a greater average effect size than written mode, especially for college level subjects. (MH)",

Three experiments, using college and high school physics students, were performed. The effects were studied by: (1) formulating explicit models of organization; (2) using extensive treatments to induce subjects to acquire specified organization; and (3) testing subjects' subsequent performance on recall and problem-solving tasks. A prescriptive model of hierarchical organization, was specified, designed to facilitate selective information retrieval, constructed by successive elaborations of a few top-level ideas most important for a specified task domain. Subjects with such a hierarchical organization performed  appreciably better compared to subjects with a single-level organization of the same knowledge. Subjects also performed better on those tasks involving information included at higher levels of the subjects' internal hierarchical organization. In general, subjects of higher ability seemed better able to assimilate and exploit hierarchical organization. Various observations indicated that training methods used were quite effective in inducing a specified internal knowledge organization. (Author/MH)",

A historical summary of the development of the plan, from the 1969 ultimatum issued to the Chicago Board of Education by the Attorney General's Office to the 1977 adoption of the plan is presented. The specific faculty desegregation policy is outlined and the procedures used by the Chicago Board of Education to implement this policy are described in detail. The role of the school principal is then analyzed. It is noted that the principal had access to the desegregation process at three points: notification of teachers; appeals procedure for those teachers who appealed on the basis of program needs of a school or data  error cases; and maintenance of teacher distribution once the desegregation plan had been implemented. Administrative problems for principals that were not anticipated by the central administration are also described. (Author/MC)",

Recently, however, it has been demonstrated that cities with different racial compositions also have different expected values of &quot;D&quot; under a random distribution of whites and blacks. Here &quot;D&quot; is compared with another, increasingly used, segregation index which we call &quot;S&quot;. Applied to measurement of school segregation, &quot;S&quot; equals the proportional underrepresentation of black students in the school attended by the average white student in the district. A principal value of &quot;S&quot; is that its expected value is independent of racial composition and rapidly approaches zero, even for modest-sized units of analysis. Also, &quot;S&quot; can be&quot;decomposed&quot; into segregation within subsets of entities and segregation between subsets. The behavior of &quot;S&quot; and &quot;D&quot; are explored with data on segregation in higher education and segregation of workers across different places of employment. (Author)",

The relationship between school racial composition and college attendance and survival rates for blacks is analyzed. The relationship between school racial composition and black achievement test score performance is also examined. Both these analyses are done separately for region (South or North). Parallel data for whites is presented. A causal model of some of the characteristics of desegregated schools is constructed. It focuses on two variables: racial composition  of teaching staff and grades blacks earn. Those characteristics of desegregated schools that determine whether blacks attend college, the kind of college they attend, and the impact of the type of high school they attended on college survival rate are examined. It is proposed that the advantages of predominantly white schools in producing high achieving, college bound black students occur only because highly motivated black students choose to attend them.

Additional data and a pattern of data analysis based on a three year investigation of a midwestern city's court-ordered desegregation program are used to illustrate a perspective for research on desegregation. Reference is made to variables which affect &quot;first order change&quot; (apparent change) and &quot;second order change&quot; (real change).

        "description":"In these appendices different aspects of the case study approach to organizational change are covered. A comparison is made between on-site interviews and telephone interviews as methods of data collection. It is concluded that in spite of the great disparity in costs, the use of personal interviews is a necessary method for data collection. Methods used in previous studies of agency innovations confirm this need. Copies of the data collection instruments used in the study, including the guidelines for face-to-face interviewing as well as the instruments for telephone interviews, are provided. Eight studies of innovation developed as a result of fieldwork are presented. For each study the background and nature of the innovation, the current status of routinization, and a review  of the possible reasons for routinization status are described. A detailed analysis of responses to telephone interviews for these case studies is provided. Also, four traditional approaches to studying bureaucratic innovation are reviewed. (Author/MC)",

        "description":"In this group of presentations from the 1978 National Conference on Higher Education, three researchers examine the need for the educational community to become more creatively responsive to the learning needs of adults. K. Patricia Cross delineates the difference between \"adult education\" and \"adult learning\". She discusses findings on adult learning behavior patterns and suggests ways that educators can help adults become more self-directed lifelong learners. In \"Major Learning Efforts,\" Allen Tough describes the pervasiveness of individual learning efforts that are undertaken without the assistance of an instructor. He outlines research and practices that would enable educators to assist a society of individual learners in choosing and guiding its learning efforts. In \"Life  Stages and Learning Interests,\" Rita Weathersby combines psychological and social society of research findings with case studies of students, illustrating why the educational community should made its resources adaptable and available to persons at all stages of life.

The task of developing the manual involved six kinds of activities, including the selection and use of an advisory committee, utilization of a technical review panel, and assessment of the manual. Topics covered in the manual as finally approved include the following: the need to improve state plans for vocational education, the planning process, planning for the preparation and submission of state plans for vocational education, and using employment data in vocational education planning. Pre- and post-tests on the manual's contents were given to two groups of nine persons. One group consisted of staff members from two state divisions of  vocational education, while the second was composed of local vocational education directors and planners. The results showed that both groups made significant gains in their knowledge about state plan development after reading the manual. (The appendix comprises three-fourths of this report and includes a list of the project consultants, advisory committee members, and technical advisory panel members; an abstract of the manual's contents; and the pre- and post-test with instructions and answer key.

Some of the major outcomes of the project include the following: two metric measurement pilot sites were successfully started and a model program for other vocational schools was adopted; a total of 109 facilitators were successfully trained to teach metric measurement to the vocational teachers; local facilitators successfully trained over 1,200 vocational teachers on how to teach metric measurement to their students; the vocational teachers gave metric measurement instruction to over 17,000 vocational students; and over 7,000 students were able to master the metric measurement material to a level of 80% or better. Further, it is projected that by 1981 the 44 vocational schools and 18 correctional institutions that received funds for metric education will have given  instruction to over 30,000 vocational students.

Five questions were addressed by the study: (1) How does the equipment used in vocational education programs compare in technical quality with that used by employers? (2) Is the equipment in the proper state of repair to be useful? (3) At what rate is the equipment wearing out or becoming obsolete? (4) How are boards of education, administrators, and staff dealing with the problems of repair, replacement, and additional needs? and (5) What is the magnitude of resources needed to replace, acquire, and maintain equipment? Ninety-eight schools,  representing all types and areas of the state, provided data. Besides survey questionnaires sent to each program, equipment lists were compiled for each, covering items by name, quantity, cost, estimated year of replacement, estimated cost of replacement, estimated maintenance, and estimated cost for miscellaneous equipment. While not a great deal of obsolete equipment was found in use, a considerable percent was classified as only adequate. It was concluded that more realistic attention should be given to equipment used in vocational programs, and a considerable financial effort is needed to correct deficiencies. (ELG)",

Data and information were gathered during the fall of 1976 and the summer of 1977 from on-site interviews with staff members of boards and systems of higher education in ten states outside North Carolina, and questionnaires were mailed to state agencies of higher education in all 50 states. Wide variations among states in the funding and planning for libraries necessitated that the information and data obtained be presented in descriptive and expository form. Results are presented in four chapters, one for each of the major areas investigated--planning for library development; the role of advisory committees  of librarians; interlibrary cooperation; and funding. Major findings indicate that (1) although little uniformity exists among states in the methods of funding academic libraries, there is a trend toward the use of formulas in statewide funding patterns; (2) a wide variety of budget formulas are presently being used and it is not likely that an \"ideal\" formula will be universally adopted; (3) there is a growing trend in overall planning and coordination of library resources within states; and (4) practically every state now has either an official advisory committee or volunteer committees.

Subjects were 11 color-blind and three normally sighted students at Brigham Young University. After a preliminary training exercise to acquaint the subjects with the TICCIT terminal, keyboard, and use of the systems's colors, subjects completed a color coding test which required them to match color coded responses with color stimuli. Students were then given a short questionnaire to assess color presentation preferences. A subject error in the test was defined as a color coding response different than the stimulus color given. Confusibility of the seven TICCIT system colors was  determined by subject color coding errors tallied into a color combination matrix. Task and questionnaire results indicated confusion among color-blind subjects in green-yellow, white-cyan, and red-black color coding combinations, while normally sighted subjects had no real trouble with any of the combinations. In addition, color-blind students felt that color was desirable in instruction if used sparingly and logically. (CMV)",

Data collected by the administration of structured questionnaires to the children in 254 classrooms and separate questionnaires completed by 4,882 of the childrens' parents indicated that: (1) the children devoted approximately 3-1/2 hours daily to television; (2) parental limitations on viewing times were more strict on nights before school days--70% and 90% of the children and parents, respectively, reported that viewing must cease at or before 10:00 p.m.--than on nights before non-school days--no parental limitations on viewing times were reported by 60% to 70% of the respondents; (3) parents and children frequently differed  in program preferences, suggesting difficulties for broadcasters in providing &quot;common denominator&quot; programs appropriate for family viewing; and (4) 80% to 90% of parents and children reported no parental guidance on 68 evening and 24 Saturday morning programs listed on the questionnaires. Demographic analyses of the data are also reported. (Author/CMV)",

A format is presented for assisting teachers in the process of personalizing instruction in an effort to optimize the learning environment for each pupil. Twelve components of this process are defined and discussed: statement of general topic, specification of content area, rationale, learner outcomes, prerequisites, preassessment, learning activities, post-assessment, remediation and/or enrichment, duration, resources needed and available, and physical arrangement. No statistical research analysis has been conducted on the effectiveness of the format; but it has face validity based  upon the comments of some 250 teachers who, over a five-year period, have studied the model, and utilized it in developing and implementing real lessons.

During the first phase, 126 public and 126 school libraries were sent two copies of the same questionnaire to be completed by one professional and one paraprofessional staff member. A 30 percent response rate was received and the responses from school libraries and public libraries were analyzed separately. Selected responses from professionals and paraprofessionals also appear in the report in both descriptive and tabular form. The second and third phases  involved meetings with voluntary public and school library groups, and discussions with representatives of training institutions. The meetings and discussions were held to elict responses to problem statements, prioritize needs, and ascertain how training institutions were responding to requests for continuing education. The report concludes with a proposal for a continuing library education plan for Oregon developed as a result of the needs assessment. A copy of the questionnaire, tabular data, and a bibliography are appended. (Author/JPF)",

Cataloging is a major area of computer application, with the MARC (MAchine Readable Cataloging) format developed by the Library of Congress providing batch mode services, and the more sophisticated OCLC (Ohio College Library Center) bibliographic data base providing online retrieval and entry of information for cataloging monographs. The success of OCLC has encouraged establishment of regional library networks, as well as several other online systems, and control of serials and periodicals via computer is now in experimental stages through the CONSER (CONversion of SERials) project. Minicomputers have been readily adapted to library circulation  systems and are widely accepted in public libraries. Online information retrieval, which was initially a tool for special libraries, is beginning to be offered by public and academic libraries, although the expense of such systems usually demand part or full recovery of search costs from the patron and the controversy of fee-for-service vs. no-charge has yet to be resolved. Continuing education for librarians and education for library patrons are important for the acceptance of future developments in library technology. (Author/JAB)",

Chapter 2 describes the methods by which the PLATO Service Organization provides author training, liaison, documentation, and other services to a large user community. Chapter 3 provides evaluation of system reliability, performance, use, and educational effectiveness, and presents a detailed case study in elementary mathematics. The next two chapters describe experience in the use of PLATO in mathematics and reading in elementary schools. Chapter 6 describes the community colleges program project, which has introduced PLATO curricula in accountancy, biology, chemistry, English and mathematics. Chapters 7 and 8 describe the experience with PLATO in the teaching of physics and chemistry at the university level. The final chapter discusses the continuous development of systems software for PLATO. (Author/VT)",

Fifteen auto-tutorial minicourses were designed for use in the laboratory part of the course, each consisting of a printed study guide, slide-tape module, laboratory exercise, grade-option activity, objective post-test, and evaluation. Data from the classes receiving conventional instruction during the spring of 1977 were compared to data gathered during the fall semester using auto-tutorial instruction. Results showed that enrollment and student retention were improved using auto-tutorial instruction. Final grades received by the experimental group were significantly higher than those  achieved by students in conventional classes. A direct correlation was shown between time spent in the laboratory and final grades. Students' attitudes were positive about auto-tutorial instruction and the minicourses, which were found to be of generally good quality, contributed to the learning of the students. Although no preference for either type instruction was shown by the auto-tutorial students, the students in conventional classes favored that type of instruction. (VT)",

There are practical suggestions not only for teachers, but also for administrators, audiovisual consultants, and co-ordinators to assist them  in planning educational utilization of television.

        "description":"In 1976 the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges Center for Community Education conducted a survey to investigate community education/services at community and junior colleges nationwide. Questionnaires were sent to 1,275 public and private two-year colleges; response rate was 61.7%. Results of the survey are divided into sections covering: an overview of community education; the identity of community education and the impact of different program names upon success; the effect of college size; the relevance of college location in a region of the nation and in urban or rural environments; the differences between public and private institutions; the control of public colleges by local, state/local or state offices. The final sections present a summary and  conclusions, a list of general concerns, and models for the most and least successful community education programs. Results indicated that successful programs were generally linked to large (more than 8,000 students), public institutions located in the suburbs of major cities in the north central or western regions of the country, and controlled by state/local agencies. Other elements of success were a program administrator with no other institutional responsibilities, and diversified funding. The survey form is appended. (TP)",

The study divided 175 students enrolled in a developmental writing course into experimental and control groups. Experimental students were separated into two sub-groups: those involved in independent study and those in small group instruction. Controls received traditional instruction in day and night sessions. Students with low pre-test scores on the McGraw-Hill Basic Skills System and who indicated strong family or associate influences received small group instruction. Independent study participants used programmed textbooks, audio tapes, and supporting materials emphasizing behavioral objectives. Results indicated that  regardless of mental ability and reading comprehension abilities, independent study group students achieved less overall than small group or traditional instruction students; traditional instruction proved most effective in night classes; and females and younger (18-23) students showed greater achievement. However, the combined results of both experimental groups compared to control findings established no significant differences. (TR)",

The introductory section discusses the necessity of staff development and its purposes, the forms its activities take, and the components of effective programming. As indicated in the literature, effective programs should be holistic, reflect the goals of the faculty involved, and consist of three facets: (1) instructional development which involves problem-solving, evaluation, diagnosis, microteaching, methodology/technology, and instructional design; (2) organizational development, including departmental decision-making and conflict management, and team and management building; and (3) personal development through life planning workshops, interpersonal skills training, personal growth  workshops, and supportive and therapeutic counseling. The remainder of the brief presents an annotated bibliography on staff development of published and unpublished materials from the ERIC files divided into six sections: comprehensive sources; examples from the colleges; particular staff needs; strategies for promoting staff development; rural and small colleges; and regional, state, and national cooperative and consortium arrangements.

Figures for fiscal year 1977 are used to assess the statewide impact of the community colleges on the business sector, in terms of total impact of expenditures by the colleges and their staffs, the sources of funds for the colleges, how much business property exists in support of their expenditures, how much the credit base of Maryland's banks expanded and how much state business volume was unrealized because of the colleges. Impact on the government sector is considered in relation to: federal tax revenues and transfer payments received by the state; revenue received by local jurisdictions; the cost to the state for provision  of services to the colleges and their employees, and the value of state property related to these services; and the amount of state and local real estate taxes foregone because of the tax-exempt status of the colleges. The colleges affected general employment by: making more full-time jobs available, by increasing the earning capacity of their graduates, and increasing state and local tax revenues generated by the increased earnings. Also considered are the state and local investments, and internal rates of return for students and the public. A bibliography and review of the literature are included. (MB)",

The requirement for demonstrated proficiency in basic skills before degree award is discussed; procedures for assessment of basic skills at entrance, requirements for computation skills and reading and writing skills, the testing of hearing, speech, and sight disorders, and faculty responsibility for these communication goals are reviewed. The &quot;survival vs. enrichment&quot; and &quot;quality&quot; issues in associate  degree programs are examined, followed by an outline of requirements for the associate in arts, associate in science, and associate in general studies degrees. Support services are described, including academic advisement, resources for developmental programs, credit by examination, and evaluation of the general education program. Standards of academic progress and resources and procedures for students in academic difficulty are outlined.

For each year in the day and evening divisions, the number of A, B, C, D, F, W (withdrawn), WF (failing at the time of withdrawal), WU (dropped for non-attendance), INC (incomplete), C (credit) and N/C (no credit) grades issued, total grades issued, total A, B, C, D, F grades issued and grade point averages (GPA) are presented. Additional tables and figures cover the number of grades per week enrollment for 1961-1977, GPAs by department for 1969, 1973 and 1977, and the number and percents of instructors and departments giving various grades for fall 1977. An examination of the statistical data reveals that more  part-time students have enrolled in recent years, and that students are enrolling in more courses and withdrawing from the less attractive or more difficult ones. GPAs were higher for day students than evening students from 1955 to 1965, after which the reverse was true. Day student GPA dropped slightly from 1955 to 1965, then rose consistently to its highest level in 1977, when GPAs for both day and evening students were close to 2.7.

Humanism is defined as an attitude that man is independent of any devine realm and therefore responsible for himself and his society; the humanist is a model in his life-style, attitudes, and goals, in his speech, writing, reading, interests, and teaching of humanistic virtues; the humanities are the affective aspects of self-discipline, brotherly love, openmindedness, ethical behavior, dignity, grace, virtue, and excellence. Humanistic education, being the sum total of these, is the humanities taught by a humanist in a spirit of humanism. The Odyssey  provides material for humanistic education's broadest subject areas: man's responsibility to himself, his family, and his society; his existence in the midst of an impersonal and 'indifferent' nature; and his attitude to the vagaries and arbitrariness of fate. The ideal common to all these areas of life is the need for self-discipline. A humanistic education should devote itself to the integration of the total person and the realization of the best of individual capabilities. A bibliography is included. (MB)",

Autobiography, as a subject for study and a focus for writing, can be a great motivator and an expediter of the learning process in English composition. The form is easy to read and interesting for the students; at the same time, it is instructive about writing style. Writing autobiography has many of the same advantages and also instills confidence and incentive in students who may have little of either. It prompts them to consider philosophic values and historical process as well as experiment with basic patterns of writing. In the classroom, the  student begins with simple patterns, such as using the narrative style to describe an event. Later when the student addresses discoveries and relationships, more complex patterns, such as illustration, definition, analysis, and comparison/contrast, are used. Other forms of exposition, and other modes of autobiography can then be explored; the genre of autobiography is an effective vehicle for expression of history, social values, aesthetic form and linguistic skills.

Existing terminal objectives of the program and each nursing module were compared with college-wide terminal objectives, overlap was eliminated, and the objectives were restated in competency-based terms. The four nursing modules were then analyzed in terms of the terminal objectives, and detailed competency statements in theoretical and clinical areas were developed. Behavioral objectives, with stated levels of mastery, were provided for each competency. The resulting extensive compilation of competencies and behavioral objectives was compared with the measurable  abilities tested in the state board examination and with data on the incidence of diseases and other medical conditions gathered from 1,887 short-term hospitals participating in the 1975 Professional Activities Study. This analysis of curriculum content revealed that diseases of the genito-urinary system, drug addiction, hernias, and appendicitis were not included in any nursing course. Only one aspect of disaster nursing was covered, but overlapping content in Nursing I, II, and III was discovered in several areas. Statistical data from the Professional Activities Study, tables correlating these data with the terminal objectives, and the extensive lists of competencies and behavioral objectives for each nursing module are included in the document.

For each day of the registration process, the desired classes were compared with the number of students enrolled in each class. Results indicated that approximately 600 (over one-fourth) of the course sections were desired by more students than were actually able to enroll in them. Over 16% (361) of the sections were courses which less than one-half of the students enrolled had selected as first choice. The course which had the highest number of students wishing to enroll in relation to the number of registrants was Beginning Ballet Techniques.

In the fall of 1977 a sample of 629 new students (described in the first phase report) was selected; the following spring, the sample was divided into two groups: those who returned for the spring 1978 semester (344) and those who did not return (285). Questionnaires were sent to both groups to determine outcomes data for non-returning students and differences between the two groups with regard to their characteristics, and evaluation of the college and their experiences. Preliminary findings indicated that 58% of the male students,  50.9% of the females, over 60% of those under 20 years of age, 82% of students carrying 16 or more units and 74% of transfer program students persisted. Both returning and non-returning students generally rated their experiences at the college as &quot;above average&quot; and &quot;excellent&quot;. Non-returning students typically reported that work-related reasons caused the interruption in their attendance. An appendix contains sample questionnaires and a collection of comments written by respondents in the non-returning student questionnaire. (Author/MB)",

These strategies consisted of a 3-step process: identifying the target behavior, recording the occurrence of the behavior in the classroom, and developing an intervention strategy. It is suggested that this approach not only reduced problem behaviors but also significantly increased the  teachers' sensitivity and responsiveness to individual and cultural differences. (BD)",

Improvement on the MRT was only moderately correlated with changes in I.Q. scores. The children with the greatest changes in I.Q. scores tended to have had less school experience and came from lower income families. The high and low MRT change groups showed  significant differences on only three of 100 variables, and the three were not in any particular group of variables, as were significant variables of the high and low I.Q. change groups. SERT scores were highly correlated with all three I.Q. test measures for both pre- and posttestings, and were consistently related to socioeconomic factors. While SERT scores did significantly increase from fall to spring, the change in SERT scores did not correlate with initial scores. (Author/JMB)",

For both boys and girls, greater male sibcare experience was positively associated with number of seconds on-task in a dyadic peer tutoring session. Regular classroom on-task rate, and measures of ability and achievement were more highly correlated with attentiveness to the peer tutor.

Twenty-four kindergarten children enrolled in a demonstration school of the Kamehameha Early Education Program(KEEF) participated in the study. Each child was assigned to one of three treatment conditions: (1) elaboration, in which a shape name was associated with a common object and included in a story; (2) rehearsal, in which the child repeated the shape name until a new shape was introduced; and (3) control, in which the child was asked to trace the shape and say its name. Recall was examined  immediately after training, two hours later, and one week later. Results indicated no significant differences between the groups on immediate recall. Elaboration subjects, however, had superior recall on the long-term (one week later) test. Across groups, subjects' scores were positively related to IQ and to number of acquisition trials, and negatively related to delay of testing after training.

Results indicated that neither the teacher's modeling behavior nor the amount of praise and amount of individual attention awarded by her was related to the children's academic achievement. Study II investigated  the effect of two methods of teacher input on student performance: working with one small group for a 5-minute period while the other children worked independently (condition A) and moving from table to table giving individual assistance as needed (condition B). The subjects, 28 kindergarten children, were divided into five heterogeneous groups. One group of six students was assigned to condition A and the rest to condition B. Differences in achievement between condition A and B were not statistically significant, although there were more statements of academic input to students under condition B than under condition A.

This paper also studies the similarities between the attributional explanations of 5-year-olds and their teachers. Twenty-eight kindergarten students, largely part-Hawaiian, were asked to explain the outcome of a story in terms of achievement determinants. Each of four teachers of the class was given a questionnaire for each child and asked to explain a given performance in terms of a rating scale of achievement dimensions. Results show outcome (positive and negative), sex, and income to be significantly related to the children's attributional choices. Income and IQ were found to be significantly related to teacher  responses. Children's choices of task and ability did not predict teacher responses; choices of luck and effort were significantly related to teacher ratings. The data indicate awarness of the causal nature of achievement in kindergarten-aged children and considerable agreement between teacher and student responses. (Author/CM)",

The 48 Hawaiian kindergarteners who served as subjects were asked to explain a fictional outcome by choosing between the four attributional determinants of achievement: task difficulty, ability, effort, and luck, which were presented in paired comparison form. The subjects' IQ, income, and mothers' education, but not birth order, were found to be related to their attributional choices. The finding that 89% of the paired comparison choices were transitive indicates that kindergarten-aged subjects have formed the connection between  achievement causes and achievement outcomes.

Teacher behaviors, pupil industriousness, and pupil reading performance were measured in the KEEP school and in classes in five Hawaiian public schools. Comparisons between these measures demonstrated that KEEP teachers use more praise than teachers in the public school classes and that KEEP children are more industrious than public school children. There were no concomitant differences, however, in reading achievement scores. It is concluded that, while industriousness is important, it is not a sufficient  prerequisite for the improvement of reading skills. It is suggested that improvement in reading achievement will depend on the development of a curriculum appropriate for the Hawaiian and part-Hawaiian populations represented in KEEP and in the Hawaiian public schools.

The achievement test scores of 50 children in two classes of the Kamehameha Early Education Program (KEEP) who had attended preschool were compared to those of their classmates who had not attended preschool. Measures of kindergarten achievement used were the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, the Metropolitan Readiness Test, and the Standard English Repetition Test, administered in the fall and spring of each class's kindergarten year. The Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test, administered in the spring of the first grade year, was used as a measure of first grade reading achievement. It was found that the preschool group had an advantage in verbal ability over the no-preschool group  throughout the kindergarten year. However, by the end of first grade, there was no difference in reading achievement between the two groups. Additional analyses on socioeconomic status (SES) variables showed that preschool attenders could not be distinguished from non-preschool attenders on the basis of socioeconomic status. These analyses, however, led to the conclusion that SES is clearly more important to kindergarten achievement than preschool attendance. (Author/JMB)",

        "description":"This paper proposes a multivariate strategy for the study of parental acceptance-rejection and child abuse and describes a research study on parental rejection and child abuse which illustrates the advantages of using a multivariate, (rather than a simple-model) approach. The multivariate model is a combination of three simple models used to study child abuse and neglect (psychiatric, behavioral and social-situational), and is based on the supposition that parental behavior is a function of the parent's personal characteristics in interaction with the child's personal characteristics and behavior and with situational factors. The model suggests that psychological, behavioral and social-situational factors almost always operate simultaneously to produce rejection and abuse.  Eighteen risk factors associated with child abuse and parental rejection are grouped into three categories consistent with the three major components in the multivariate model. A study of 14 abusive and 11 nonabusive families illustrates the relative advantages of the multivariate over the simple-model approach. Data on all three elements of the model were collected through home visits over a period of three months, the Parental Acceptance-Rejection Questionnaire (Adult PARQ II), the Personality Assessment Questionnaire (Adult PAQ), and a background data schedule measuring situational and demographic information. The child's perception of his parents' behavior was obtained through the Child PARQ, and an individual interview. Study data, analysed using both simple-model and multivariate  approaches, indicated that variation in parental behavior could be better explained through an analysis of the cumulative effect of multiple risk factors (multivariate model) rather than three factors by themselves (simple-model).

        "description":"The rural population constitutes a large segment of the total population. Using 1970 census estimates, the total rural population was over 53.8 million people. Of these, 46.4% was less than 25 years of age. Of these 25 million rural youth, about 10.5 million were located in the South and 7.4 million in the North-Central Region. The Northeast and West had substantially smaller proportions. There were 2.3 million Black, 700,000 Spanish heritage, and 300,000 Native American rural youth; the rest were classified as white. Yet substantial numbers of rural Americans suffer from problems of opportunity, achievement, attainment, services and stereotyping. Since the rural economy generally centers around agricultural production and services which support such production, the rural  occupation structure is relatively undifferentiated as to types of occupation. Therefore, agricultural education has been expanded to include a wide range of agricultural nonproduction occupations--many of which have as their residential locus the city rather than the farm. Highlighting some issues considered critical to the understanding of education and work in contemporary Rural America, this paper overviews the demography of rural youth with comments on the implication of ethnic, racial, and regional variation; speculates on the growth of higher education in agriculture and the urbanization of the occupational structure of agriculture; discusses the lack of research on racial desegregation of rural schools; and presents some new data on the recent growth of private school enrollment.

A study of Indian unemployment in Wisconsin indicates that the employment level in Indian communities both on and off the reservation is affected by such conditions as the out-migration of Indians in the prime working ages of 25 to 45, the lack of accessability of local economic activity to Native Americans, and the match between the skill levels of the Native American labor force and the skill requirements of the labor market. Several policy implications stem from these findings: making reservation life more attractive to stem the outmigration of prime aged workers; expanding the Indian community's economic base to make  employment opportunities more accessible to the Indian population and to help eliminate Indian reluctance to become involved in traditionally non-Indian dominated activities; &quot;trickling down&quot; aid through the larger community to help Indians; developing economic opportunities within the reservation; and upgrading the skills of Native Americans to make them more competitive in the labor market and to aid the Indian community's economic development.

Designed as a semester course, the course aims to teach American Indian youth their rights and responsibilities under the U.S. Constitution and under their respective state and tribal governments, and to develop an awareness and an understanding of the concepts, principles, and functions of student rights and responsibilities both within the school and community environment. Consisting of 11 units, the course covers basic types of educational systems and laws, jurisdiction of courts, sources of law, the Bill of Rights, the right to privacy, student body constitution, due process in the school and in the community, the Indian Bill of Rights,  voter education, fair trial/free press, consumer rights and responsibilities, and sources of authority for Indian schools and programs relating to American Indians. Briefly discussed are the course objectives, student competencies, student evaluation, and teaching strategies for law focused education (small groups, peer teaching, films, field trips, speakers, simulation games, and case studies). Also included are a 19-item bibliography and lists of 6 law-related audiovisuals (source, series, film title, and level) and 6 supplemental materials. (NQ)",

The section for administrators, legislators, civic organizations, promotional groups, technical assistance agencies, and educators contains 10 major headings, classifying  materials that have a direct bearing on particular problems and policies; for example, evaluation of industrial potential, labor supply, and training situations; industrial sites, community organization and support; recruiting; economic and social impacts; and government policies and programs. The section for researchers and academicians has basic research reports and more technical and conceptually oriented materials categorized under four major headings.

        "description":"Relative to other urbanized areas, the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas consistently ranks at the bottom in regard to almost every objective indicator of socioeconomic welfare: per capita income, educational attainment, employment, and health and housing conditions. The 1970 census discovered that approximately one-half of its population, comprised primarily of Mexican Americans, fell below government designated poverty thresholds. Based on a multidimensional approach, including assessment of the region and population in dynamic and longitudinal terms rather than as static entities, this paper provides a broad overview of the region's poverty through the synthesis of existing literature and data. The paper provides a brief sketch of the Valley; addresses the nature and extent of  real poverty (the poverty status accorded on the basis of income below government established criteria) in the region by reference to data on income, education, employment, housing and health; addresses the question of regulated poverty (the differential distribution of real poverty across ethnic or racial groups) via a historical discussion of the region as an ethnically stratified social system; and, stimulated by the relative poverty concept (calls attention to cultural definitions and individual subjective evaluations of poverty status), establishes the hypothesis that the region may be sociologically approached as a &quot;staging area&quot;, characterized by five on-going and interrelated mobility patterns.

        "author":["Wheelock, Gerald C."],
        "description":"A preliminary model of community economic development processes, consisting of a system of simultaneous equations, is used to describe how these processes influence changes in median family income and income inequality. The analysis was performed on 61 racially mixed counties in Alabama, using 1960-70 census data. Social and demographic variables used were a Gini Index of Income Inequality in 1960 and changes in labor-force participation, manufacturing, managers, and in white and black shares of male employment. Other variables were measures of 1960-70 income distribution, 1960 median family income, proportion of black male labor force in 1960, professionals, high school education, and female-headed families. The model suggested that in urban communities, income distribution  patterns are favorably influenced by division of labor at professional and managerial levels, while in low income communities, manufacturing is the path to increased median incomes. Increase in labor force participation was the key to average increase in median income and reduced income inequality in middle and lower-middle class communities. Racial disparities were evident in all cases, but in all communities, increases in education led to increased incomes and indirectly to reduced income inequality. This indicates that strategies for rural community development should be related to schools and education. (RS)",

        "author":["Kuvlesky, William P."],
        "description":"A comparative analysis of the findings of three studies involving widely varying ethnic groupings of rural youth was conducted in order to evolve a speculative frame of propositions about religion as a variable attribute of the life situation of rural youth, and to speculate about the possible significance of patterned variability in religious orientation and organization as an attribute of rural communities relative to its impact on the youth's self-defined interests and values. Representing New Mexico Spanish Americans, Ohio Mennonite-Amish, and Texas Mexican Americans, Blacks, and Anglos, and at least three cultural regions of the U.S. (South, Northeast, and Southwest), the studies did not focus on religious phenomena per se; however, each involved, as a part of other primary  objectives, recording of observations on youth's religious behavior and orientations. All variable aspects of religion as it related to rural youth's orientations, behavior, and social contexts and which were included in any of the three studies were listed. Then a brief notational conclusion about what was found in reference to each study was given. It was concluded that religion will vary in its significance for the individuals included. At the same time, to the extent that religion varies as a social institution in the sociocultural context of a locality or a social area (consisting of similar local communities), it can have a patterned variability in significance for and impact on youth as a whole.

Data were drawn from both the Censuses of Agriculture (taken at five year intervals, the last of which was taken in fall of 1969) and the decennial Censuses of Population and Housing (the last of which was taken in April,1970). Results indicated the following dramatic changes during the 1950-1970 period: outstanding improvements in farm mechanization, ownership tenure, automotive transportation, and possession of convenience appliances; deficiencies in about 25% of the rural farm and nonfarm housing;  comparable rural and urban lifestyles (as measured by income and education levels) among whites with the lowest income and education levels of all groups investigated obtaining among the rural blacks, though this level was not far from that of urban blacks; small and seemingly residual urban-rural differences for family size, fertility ratios, and female labor force participation; a trend toward mixing farm and off-farm occupations; industrial interdependence, establishing farm-to-factory commuting and urban types of conveniences for rural Mississippians; a tremendous reduction in the size of the state's farming population, changing production from an essentially self-sufficient family farm type to that of a more efficient industrial-commercial nature.

This last cause is the most difficult to correct. The decision not to adopt new practices is based on attitudes, values, and goals; these may need to be changed before different decisions can be reached. Adopters and non-adopters exhibit distinctly different characteristics, attitudes, value orientations, and behavior patterns. Different methods of communication are required to reach these discrete audiences. In the spread of information to disadvantaged farm populations, publications are not as effective as communication on a one to one basis. Information is best  exchanged and accepted through face to face contact with county extension agents, home economics agents, nutrition aids, vocational-agricultural teachers, government representatives, and especially with family, friends, and neighbors. Attitudes such as traditionalism, conservatism, familism, and debt avoidance inhibit the adoption of new ideas. Guidelines are listed for a change agent to utilize in promoting both a positive attitude toward change and the acceptance of new ideas. (Author/DS)",

        "description":"An all-encompassing definition of the traditional role of the Indian woman is hard to reach because that role changes with every tribal group. However, by examining one group, the Woodland Indians, an idea of the Indian woman's role can emerge. The &quot;poor, overworked squaw&quot; stereotype is erroneous, for early Indian men and women were regarded as equals. Indian women held positions of authority in civil and religious affairs. They usually decided when the camp would move and where it would relocate. Highly skilled as builders and architects, they owned their homes and the tools used in their duties of food gathering and preparation, soil cultivation, dressing skins, etc. Although their days were filled with many tasks, their responsibilities were no greater than that of the men,  and they were assisted by the children, old people, and men unable to hunt. They were highly regarded and protected by their tribe. In addition to a lengthy description of the traditional role of the Indian woman, this document features a &quot;Things to Do With Your Daughter&quot; section which suggests discussions and other activities based on stereotypes; past and present roles of women; and famous Indian women, their contributions, strengths, and characteristics.

        "description":"Very common among young people is the attitude that sex should be absolutely spontaneous. Taking precautions in advance of intercourse is cold, calculating and unromantic. Some teenagers regard themselves as invulnerable; only other girls get pregnant. These and other attitudes surrounding teenage pregnancies are explored in this unit, which attempts to give adults information and background that will help young girls in making decisions about marriage. Some history of birth control methods used by various tribal groups is given, traditional marriage customs are described, and the recent changes in attitudes about marriage and the woman's role are discussed. Problems of teenage marriage and pregnancy are also explored. An activity section of the document features questionnaires  on venereal disease, marriage IQ, marriage contracts, and teenage marriages. Using these questionnaires as a starting point can help facilitate discussions and impart information. A &quot;How Parents Can Help&quot; section gives practical advice in building feeling of parental approval and support and &quot;Things to Do With Your Daughter&quot; lists activities and discussion topics. This unit is based on the units for teenage girls &quot;Just for You&quot; and &quot;Marriage--Expectations or Reality.&quot; (Author/DS)",

With this as a basic premise, this document (prepared for parents and adult leaders) lists discussion topics or other kinds of activities that will help young girls explore several concepts. (1) Many forces tell a girl that she needs to improve or change her body image, thus lessening her self concept. Girls need to be proud of their bodies as they are. (2) Women have not had equal opportunities in athletics. Often women do not take pride in a strong body. A strong body can help a girl face the world with courage. (3) One of the myths of society is that girls are to be successful as housewives and men are to be successful in the world of work. (4) Some people label men and women with  different kinds of characteristics. (5) At about junior high age girls' grades begin to drop and they begin to view themselves as preparing for a role as a mate and childbearer rather than for a career. (6) The socialization of girls is also influenced by parents, schools, and the media. (Author/DS)",

        "description":"Pressure from the mass media, parents, and peers often causes young girls to concentrate on their most external aspects at a time when the inner demand for self definition is equally important. In the struggle to receive attention from boys, many girls suppress their identities, fearful that if they allowed their true selves to emerge they would not be attractive as women. Physical activities are often abandoned and girls fail to develop strength and pride in their bodies. Grades slide as they decide to settle for being clerical workers or teachers instead of scientists or engineers. Society seems to declare motherhood as the ultimate goal for a girl, regardless of her abilities or interests, yet often that is completed by the time a woman is 40. Her children are grown, the  external beauty is faded, and little else is left for her. Girls need to be aware of all that the future may hold; they need to prepare themselves in terms of their own goals, abilities and preferred life styles. This document concludes with two sections that suggest discussions and other activities parents can utilize in helping their daughters develop their own individual talents, independence, and self confidence.

Today five out of ten women between the ages of 18 and 64 are working outside the home. A young woman must plan to be a worker as well as wife and mother. One fourth of all American Indian women who work for pay are clerical workers, one-fifth service workers, and another one-fifth do factory type work, all relatively low paying jobs. The world is changing; women expect to live longer and have fewer children; and there are more widowed, divorced, separated, and unmarried women. Greater attention must be given to career planning. This document is the introduction to the &quot;Choices and Careers: Free to Choose&quot; program for young tribal women, which endeavors to help girls think  through the choices they have and to plan so that options are open for career choices. It discusses new career opportunities for women, including the non-traditional jobs becoming available, the value of higher education, and early conditioning that creates the passivity, dependence and non-competitive attitudes that hamper girls in realizing their fullest potential.

A girl's socialization is different from that of a boy. Boys are taught to be self reliant, strong, independent, aggressive, and competitive. Girls are praised for being passive, dependent, nurturant, and obedient. From the time she is very small a little girl is guided to the role of mate-mother. Such socialization is unrealistic. Nine out of ten women will work at some point in their lives. Many must be the sole support of themselves or their families. Girls must prepare for a career. Individuals are born with talents, abilities and  potentialities, but training and education are necessary for them to be recognized. A counselor is a very important part of the socialization process because she can help girls learn of the many choices open to them and prepare for a life of many roles. Suggestions counselors can utilize to accomplish this are listed in the conclusion of this document. (Author/DS)",

All five counties experienced outmigration in the 1950s, and all but Athens County lost population through outmigration in the 1960s. In the turnaround period of 1970 to 1975, all counties but Athens experienced net inmigration. Questionnaires were mailed to 1,134 recent migrants to the area. A follow-up postcard was sent to non-respondents. Phone calls were then made to a sample of non-respondents. Data were obtained from 222 returned questionnaires and 99 migrants who were called. Questionnaires were also mailed to 50 community leaders from each county, except Athens;  191 questionnaires were completed. Among the findings were that 66.2% of the migrants saw their current residence as substantially better as a place to raise children than their previous one and about 40% saw housing, education and solid waste pick-up as worse; about 37% of the leaders felt that the migrants were responsible for the substantial rise in property values; over 72% of the leaders saw a substantial increase in the demand for water and sewage services; 31% of the leaders noted a substantial increase and 35% indicated a slight increase in business activity; and 7% of the leaders said the new residents had no effect on the community, 14% saw little effect, and nearly half did not feel strongly enough to comment at all.

        "description":"Using data from the \"Federal Outlays\" published by the Community Services Administration, data on federal outlays in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan counties for fiscal 1976 were analyzed. The outlays programs were divided into seven major program area categories: human resource development, housing, community and industrial development, agriculture and natural resources, defense and space, justice and law enforcement, and general functions and government administration. In addition to data previously reported in annual Presidential reports on government services to rural America, data on about 400 outlays program categories were added. For the most part, the new programs involved direct federal government operations rather than assistance to state and local governments. Several  programs reflecting federal administrative and procurement expenses were also included. Of the $385.2 billion in federal government outlays reported by the Community Services Administration for fiscal 1976, $314.5 billion were traced to individual counties. Over 76% of these outlays were made in metropolitan counties. Since the population in metropolitan counties in 1975 comprised 72.8% of the U.S. total, per capita federal outlays were higher in metropolitan areas ($1,555) than in nonmetropolitan areas ($1,271). Regionally, per capita outlays were highest in the West ($1,887) and South ($1,599) and below average in the Northeastern ($1,323) and North Central ($1,192) regions. For all regions, per capita outlays were highest in declining metropolitan counties and lowest in growing  nonmetropolitan counties. (AUTHOR/NQ)",

Crime rates, drug addiction, violence, and alienation show widespread dissatisfaction with aspects of life. Quality of life should therefore not be measured solely in terms of material wealth; psychological indicators should also be used. Data collected from 1,630 rural household heads (1,218 white, 369 black, 43 American Indian) in eight Southern states studied the nature of this relationship between objective and subjective quality of life measures. The study included three indexes: (1) an Objective Family Quality of Life covering socioeconomic status, leisure-time activity participation, and a level of living scale; (2) a Subjective Family Quality of Life showing satisfaction  of the household head with his residence, income, and his perception of changes in his family situation; (3) a Subjective County Quality of Life measuring perception of changes in county economic opportunities, government, and services. Findings indicated mild positive correlation between objective and subjective family quality of life indices and between subjective family and subjective county quality of life indices. With the exception of white respondents, no relationship was found between objective family and subjective county quality of life indices. Lack of strong correlation suggests the inadvisibility of substituting one index for the other. (DS)",

Of these, 85% resided in metropolitan areas. About 42% were under 18 years old, while only about 4% were 65 years old and over. Among those 25 to 29 years old, 57% had a high school education, as compared with only 30% of those 45 to 64 years old. About 21% of the families had incomes below the poverty level in 1977; only 9.7% had incomes of $25,000 or more. About 80% of the men were in the civilian labor force compared with 45% of the women. The median income for the men was $7,797 while the median income of  the women was $3,669. Although both men and women of Spanish origin were about equally likely to be currently married in March 1978, the men were more likely than the women to have never been married, and the women were more likely than the men to be either widowed or divorced. This report presents advance data, collected in March 1978 by the Census Bureau, on the demographic, social and economic characteristics of persons of Spanish origin. Characteristics presented include age, sex, marital status, educational attainment, employment status, occupation, and income. Data on residence, income, and poverty status are shown for families of Spanish origin. (NQ)",

Designed in response to significant problems encountered in the implementation of PL 93-368, this amendment is identified as one that will leave PL 93-368 intact but will add a new option whereby the American Indian tribes may elect to develop a comprehensive tribal plan for the administration and delivery of the total range of government services for which they are eligible. As described here, the Secretary of the Interior  would be authorized to provide a consolidated single grant to implement these tribal plans, the intent being to greatly simplify the excessive paperwork generated by the contracting process and to allow for the necessary flexibility in local policy determinations by the tribes. The &quot;Opening Statement&quot; (Senator Abourezk) asserts that there has been no meaningful transfer of control in the implementation of PL 93-368 because the agencies (Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Service) have incorporated into the contracts their identification of priorities and policies rather than allowing tribes to make the determination, while the tribes have been restricted to formulating their policy within the narrow parameters of the current agency programs and budget allocations.

        "description":"The Survey of Oceanic Attitudes and Knowledge (SOAK) was developed as a method of measuring knowledge and attitudes of tenth grade students and relating those attributes to the students' marine experiences. Fifteen coastal and fifteen inland schools in Virginia were randomly selected as sources of subjects for the study. Analyses of data from 787 tenth grade respondents revealed a statewide knowledge level of about fifty per cent with regard to the marine topics covered by 63 items across three forms of the knowledge survey. Attitudes toward a variety of marine issues were shown to be moderately positive. The relationship between certain demographic variables and the dependent variables of marine attitudes and knowledge was examined. For knowledge, the results indicated the main  effects of race, and residence, and interaction between residence and sex. Attitude scores revealed main effects of race only. On the basis of this study, the author recommended that more marine information be included in existing curricula to foster the development of a marine-literate citizenry. (Author/MA)",

This report consists of four sections. The first provides examples of the problems that must be handled by a diagnostic model. It then introduces procedural networks as a general framework for representing the knowledge underlying a skill. The second section discusses some of the pedagogical issues that have emerged from the use of diagnostic models within an instructional system. This discussion is framed in the context of a computer-based tutoring/gaming system developed to teach students and student  teachers how to diagnose bugs strategically as well as how to provide a better understanding of the underlying structure of arithmetic skills. The third section describes our uses of an executable network as a tool for automatically diagnosing student behavior, for automatically generating &quot;diagnostic&quot; tests, and for judging the diagnostic quality of a given exam. Included in this section is a discussion of the success of this system in diagnosing 1300 school students from a data base of 20,000 test items. The last section discusses some future research directions. (Author/MN)",

        "description":"An experiment was performed that allowed measurements of both axial mass and heat transport of He-II (the superfluid phase of helium 4) in a long tube. The apparatus allowed the pressure difference and the temperature difference across the flow tube to each be independently adjusted, and the resulting steady-state values of net fluid velocity and axial heat transport to be measured. For the larger Reynolds numbers, the relation between pressure difference and net fluid velocity was nearly indistinguishable from that of an ordinary fluid in turbulent flow. The axial heat transported was suppressed from the values that were calculated by assuming that mutual friction was unchanged by the net fluid flow, but it was always larger than the enthalpy rise value. Taking this second value  as a lower limit, a mild extrapolation of these results suggests that (in appropriate circumstances) forced convection would allow much greater heat to be transported in long cooling channels than could be transported by natural convection alone.

In the workshops citizens are able to make judgments on the use of energy resources, environmental effects, growth, and the quality of life using the energy-environment simulator (an analog computer decision-making game). This handbook gives a brief discussion of energy and environmental topics, a quiz to test knowledge of energy-environment issues, a glossary of important energy words, and a list of publications.

        "description":"The United States changeover to the use of the SI (International Metric) measurement language presents the construction industry with the need to review and adapt many product standards and practices for the use of metric measurement units. These adaptations and changes can bring substantial benefits to the industry in the form of permanently recurring cost savings. A practice of potentially great benefit would be the incorporation of dimensional coordination in the new metric standards for sizes of building products. For such benefits to be realized however, the involved issues must be effectively addressed and the requisite decisions made and implemented. Considerable literature pertinent to the issues and decisions has been published in the United States and in other  (primarily English-speaking) countries that have been implementing metriciation and dimensional coordination in the past decade. This report aids construction industry consideration and resolution of metrication decisions by providing a guide to the best available resources relevant to the issues. A list of key issues and relevant questions to those issues is presented and referenced to a list of sources with abstracts. The key issues are: metrication, dimensional coordination, institutional arrangements, international interchange, and general. (MP/Author)",

The articles concerning the transitional phases between concrete and formal operations focus on elementary transformation geometry concepts and emphasize the role that figurative content  can play in influencing the difficulty of Piaget-type tasks. Two articles in this group focus on affine transformations, similarities, or projections. The articles dealing with older subjects or formal operational concepts investigate topics such as: (1) the nature of specific mathematical concepts as they relate to the cognitive structure of the learner; (2) understanding of frames of reference by preservice teacher education students as determined by Piagetian tasks; and (3) the bias for upright figures that students exhibit in forming concepts.

This part also includes practice problems for all teachers involving the mathematics of metrics. The second part consists of ideas and activities that teachers of the nonmathematics curriculum may incorporate into their lessons to aid in the total metric experience of the learner. Included in this part are sections on language arts, reading, social studies, music, and art. The third part  deals with classroom activities that teachers of mathematics may use. A special section is included which uses only nonstandard measurement activities designed for primary children. Attention is also given in this section to the use of metric measurements in presenting activities that are concrete, semi-concrete, and abstract in nature. The activities are labeled according to length, weight, area, volume, and temperature. (Author/MP)",

The effect of part-load operation on the heat pump's cooling and heating coefficients of performance was determined. Discrepancies between measured performance and manufacturer-supplied performance data were found when the unit was in the heating mode and outside temperatures were below 40 degrees F presumably due to frost build-up on the outdoor coil. The seasonal performance factor (SPF) of the heat pump was estimated and traced back to the power plant to determine an &quot;effective SPF&quot; which was compared to the performance expected from fossil-fuel heating equipment. If the estimated seasonal performance is representative of residential situations in this type  of climate then no clear-cut advantage in saving primary source energy exists in choosing either heat-pump or fossil-fuel heating system. This study is part of the National Bureau of Standards Building Science Series. (Author/MR)",

These case study projects are designed to be used with kindergarten through college students. The case studies are organized by grade level into five chapters. Chapter I suggests ways to teach economic concepts to educable mentally handicapped children in grades K-3 and provides curriculum materials for typical first and second grade children on scarcity, economic disadvantagement of blacks in the United States, and the role of the government in meeting consumer demands. Chapter II focuses on community issues and economic awareness for grades four through six. Chapter III offers materials on money, banking, the Federal Reserve System, small business economics,  restaurant management, and the relationship between economics and values for use in grades seven to nine. A general economics program for teenage mentally handicapped students is also outlined in this chapter. Chapter IV contains descriptions of four programs for high school students. Topics are the world marketplace, values in decision making, analytical economics for intellectually gifted students, and a self-contained mini-economy. The final chapter offers four models for curriculum development on the college level. An appendix at the end of each chapter provides brief overviews of additional courses and programs in economic education. For each case study, information is presented on grade level, project background, student ability, objectives, activities, and evaluation.  (Author/DB)",

        "description":"The paper compares aspects of decision making in health and education in the United States and Great Britain from 1890-1970. The major purpose is to demonstrate variety in the degree of centralization within the two policy areas during this period. Centralization is defined as the degree to which all resources of a given type are controlled by one or many decision-making authorities. The document is presented in three sections. Section I reviews social science literature relating to centralization. Section II explains how an interpretation of centralization which emphasizes the structural aspects of decision making contributes to a better understanding of policy formation. Topics discussed include boundaries of a policy area, resource flows, types of decisions and decision  makers, and concentration of power. Section III offers case studies of health and educational policy formation in the United States and Great Britain. For each policy area, information is given on sources of revenue, number of decision makers, control over training of professionals, employment, staff decisions, and expenditures. Findings indicate that although the two countries displayed a general tendency toward concentration in decision making, they had quite different time frames in progress to their 1970 levels.

        "description":"Proceedings are presented of a 1977 conference about aspects of international trade negotiations of importance to developing countries. Participants included staff from Washington-based international organizations, various United States departments, Congressional staff, and students of the Foreign Service Institute. Transcripts of three addresses are presented, including comments by two respondents for each paper. The first paper considers special and differential (S&amp;D) treatment measures for exports of developing countries to provide opportunities for improved market-access in developed countries' sectors where quantitative restrictions constitute an important obstacle to trade. The second paper discusses the international experience with safeguard actions under existing rules  of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It also makes recommendations to improve the functioning of the safeguard system including provisions of S&amp;D treatment for developing countries. The third paper argues that an accepted element of any new agreement on the use of export subsidies and other promotion schemes should be that equity and international relations considerations justify a differential treatment for export promotion schemes adopted by developing countries.

Section II presents three colloquium papers. In the first paper, entitled \"What Should We Learn from the History of Citizenship Education in the United States?\", R. Freeman Butts stresses the importance of political education  and points out how educational environment influences students' values, knowledge, and political participation skills. In the second paper, \"Education of the American Citizen: An Historical Critique,\" Clarence Karier surveys the dilemma posed by having to choose between education for human development and education to fulfill social needs and provides samples of citizenship programs. The final paper, \"Education For Citizenship,\" by Marvin Lazerson, focuses on multicultural factors in citizen education. Topics discussed include Americanization and schooling, protestantism and patriotism, citizenship and work, and citizenship in a pluralist world. (Author/DB)",

Torney, stresses the need to relate global concepts to citizenship and to objectives for citizen education. Torney also suggests that a citizenship education program should consider average ages at which children have various kinds of skills and abilities. Comments on Torney's paper by colloquium participants emphasize the need to relate psychological studies of citizen education to political science and sociological literature. The second paper, by Byron G. Massialas, analyzes definitions of citizen education and describes a high school program to involve students in decision making. Discussion of Massialas' paper focuses on problems of  making models for citizen education programs on the basis of one case study and the need to differentiate types of political participation. The discussion concludes with the recommendation that citizen education programs be developed in concordance with value systems at home and school and that they consider individual and social needs.

        "description":"Two-thirds of what we waste could be reused without important changes in our life-styles. One benefit of recycling would be the diminishing contribution of raw materials prices to inflation. For a sustainable resource policy there are three basic components: waste reduction, waste separation, and waste recovery. The first can be met by producing more durable goods, banning non-refillable containers, increasing charges for pick-up and disposal of waste, designing products which are easy and economical to repair, and ending discriminatory taxes and regulation. Separation of waste in homes and disposal units will facilitate recycling of paper, aluminum, glass, metals, and even plastics, though there are attendant problems of cost and social acceptance. Energy can be produced from  waste when valuable materials are removed through chemical and physical processes. The possible impact of future mineral cartels such as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) could be reduced through recycling. The amount of energy saved by recycling compared with that expanded on processing virgin materials ranges from eight to 95%. To go from conspicuous consumption to conspicuous frugality specific policies and social commitment are necessary. In this regard the public may be ahead of its leaders. (Author/DL)",

The main process themes--experiencing, decision-making, cooperating, and evaluating--are implemented through four learning modes: (1) field experiences; (2) goal setting; (3) seminars; and (4) learning projects. A decrease in time devoted to traditional courses is complemented by increases in student interaction with faculty and materials by way of conferences, seminars, and projects, and in field experiences. An elementary education major in TEAM typically spends five quarters in field experiences at various schools. Another feature is the integration of subject areas and of  on-campus learning with field experiences. A differentiated staffing pattern is provided with faculty serving in three basic roles: coordinator; advisory group leaders who meet weekly with students for personalized needs related to learning, goal setting, and evaluation; and special area faculty responsible for subject matter and field supervision.

In the final three years, the project participants were involved in their senior-level student teaching experiences and their post-college teaching assignments. The major objective of the project was to institute a pilot program in the undergraduate preparation in science for elementary teachers leading to the development of a six-semester integrated science-methodology course coupled with early and continued elementary school teaching experience. Inquiry  training beginning with basic and simple scientific concepts was the fundamental method of instruction.

Subjects making free-selected movements were allowed to determine distance moved, terminal location, and speed of response. Subjects made preselected movements under similar conditons, except that the experimenter reminded them of the importance of preselections, as well as to move at a slow but continuous speed, and not to choose the same movement more than once during the sequence. When making constrained movements, subjects moved at a slow but continuous speed to a terminal location that was  chosen at random by the experimenter. The methodology and design of this research is described in this report. Results indicated that the reproduction accuracy of free-selected movements were superior to that of preselected movements, which in turn exhibited less reproduction error than constrained movements. However, those performers making preselected movements were no less variable than those making constrained movements. A discussion of the possible bias provided by experimenter instruction is included. (JD)",

A taxonomy of human movement processes is outlined for utilization in: (1) defining educational objectives; (2) sequencing learning materials; (3) providing augmented feedback to learners; and (4)  evaluating student progress. The proposed aim is to highlight the potential of planned purpose-process interactions for enriched movement learning experiences resulting in sounder physical education curricula.

The basic problems facing successful organization of teacher centers are seen as threefold: institutions of higher education believe that they hold the primary leadership role because of their historic prominence; teachers believe they should be the primary collaborators because of their practical experience and knowledge; and school administrators feel that their responsiblility for the accountability of what happens means they should have the primary role. This paper reviews and synthesizes the literature dealing with collaboration. Additionally, it explains the development of the  collaborative effort in teacher education. The stated purpose of this study is to improve an understanding of collaboration and of the importance of it in the developmental history of teacher education with the aim of assisting in the evaluation of cooperative effort in teacher education centers.

The content of this invitational process is a type of self-belief extended from one person to the other, a belief that each individual has an unknown potential only partially actualized, and is ultimately an able, valuable, and responsible human being and can behave as such. The skillful invitational teacher, then, is someone who can develop a trusting relationship with students, is competent in assessing their personal self theories, and can communicate meaningful messages. A number of questions still need to be addressed by researchers, however, concerning the identification of invitational  messages, proper developmental patterns, reasons for not extending invitations, ethical dimensions, reasons for rejection of invitations, and identification of disinvited students. Furthermore, the overall concept of invitational teaching is limited in its approach to content. To be effective, teachers must conjoin their invitational teaching skills with an understanding of the major concepts, methodologies, and organization of a particular field of knowledge. The invitational teacher must perceive not only the importance of knowing something, but of how one knows something, i.e., how we make sense of the world. The invitational teacher, then, is someone who perceives students as fellow human beings and knowledge as vital inquiry and is skillful in coordinating these relationships through  behaviors so that students are invited to learn.

The University initially is concentrating its training in the areas of teacher education, health services, and rural development. In designing and implementing all educational programs the principles of competency-based education are being applied. The most pressing need has been determined to be competent secondary school teachers of science and mathematics. To train teachers to meet this need, a priority listing of goals was specified using three basic criteria: relative importance and influence with respect to continued development of  Iranian society; relative feasibility when considering the conditions necessary to implement each goal; and relative time required for prospective teachers to demonstrate adequately the necessary competencies. The required skills for teachers are delineated within the framework of these goals. Components of the four-year training program are outlined in this paper. (JD)",

The objective was the identification of a construct-valid set of cognitive ability tests for entry level positions. Twenty-seven representative occupations were selected for intensive study, and the duties of these occupations were rated by experts for importance and time spent in their performance. A set of 31 knowledges, skills, abilities, and other worker characteristics (KSAO's) were also rated with respect to these occupations. Finally, a set of six cognitive abilities were selected by personnel psychologists for further study. Weights for these six  abilities were then established for each of the 27 occupations. The ratings and the weighting system were studied to form seven occupational groups. Finally, a total of 120 occupations were assigned to these seven groups by subject matter experts on the basis of similarity of KSAO's. (Author/CTM)",

A second set of tables shows the interaction of Veteran Preference, Outstanding Scholar, sex of competitor, and written test performance on the probability of consideration for federal employment. The final tables indicate the proportions of competitors at or above certain ratings--hence the probabilities that such groups will be given  employment consideration--as a function of current federal employment, geographic region, and college major.

Both deduction and induction involve the derivation of a conclusion from a set of premises. Deductive logic uses syllogisms and is abstract. Inductive logic is both empirical and abstract. Although inductive judgments cannot reliably tell us anything about particulars, we do in fact rely upon induction, and it constitutes our only possibility of making contact with the empirical manifold. Inductive reasoning may be used either to generate laws or to form judgments of probability. Item analysis data are presented, as are reliability coefficients. (Author/CTM)",

The former is used to determine if treatment group regressions are nonparallel while the latter is used to determine the range of aptitude values for which the heterogeneous group regessions are significantly different. While the above procedures have become somewhat commonplace among ATI researchers, quantitative indices which can be used to determine the practical importance of a region of significance are conspicuously absent from any discussion of ATI methodology. The purpose of this paper is to outline a quantitative procedure for determining the practical importance  of a region of significance and to illustrate by reanalysing data from published ATI research studies that a failure to use the procedure could lead to trivial and/or erroneous research conclusions.

It is a communications vehicle using an iterative author-commenter cycle which focuses attention on defined topics, increases management control, creates a systematic work breakdown structure, and minimizes error through disciplined flexibility. The U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) has responsibility for two programs: a combat development program and a training program. TRADOC has developed such innovations as Skill Qualification Tests (SQTs), criterion referenced performance tests based on job analysis for each MOS; training and evaluation collectives, various simulators (such as a laser  simulator for the M16 rifle), and various battlefield simulators. SADT was developed to expedite innovations in training and to achieve improvements in Army training as a unified system. The evaluation of SADT was conducted in three phases, based on the opinions and attitudes of participating personnel. Although the SADT process was only partially implemented, participating officers expressed increasingly positive attitudes and confidence with increasing experience; a six-week follow-up indicated these opinions remained stable.

Title IV provides funds to purchase school library or other instructional resources; develop, field test, and disseminate innovative programs; and assist the state to identify and meet educational needs. Three basic questions were: (1) To what extent did the state adhere to the multiple elements of each program, as set forth in the 1976 Annual Program Plan?; (2) In what respects did the procedures used support or hinder  efficiency in program administration and achievement of program objectives?; and (3) To what extent have program objectives for each part of Title IV actually been achieved? In nearly every instance, the administrative procedures and activities set forth in New Jersey's Annual Program Plan were carried out in an exemplary fashion, as they had been in the 1976 fiscal year program.

Students who pass the exam may leave school as early as two years before they would otherwise be permitted to. This study focused on four specific areas: (1) an overview to provide the legislative and implementation background and to expore the climate which led to the concept of an &quot;early-out&quot; exam; (2) questionnaires, given to a sample of the December, 1975, examinees concerning: who would take the exam, why, and what qualities and experiences would they have; (3) questionnaires mailed to all high schools in the state to explore the school response to the CHSPE program and to those students who take the exam; and (4) a  structured interview administered to a sample of district superintendents and school principals. Results indicate that the CHSPE program has worked well for a few individuals, saved the state nearly 5 million dollars in the first year of its operation, and had a negligible impact on the schools. As long as the severe financial disincentive to the schools persists, these program outcomes will likely remain unaltered. The most effective way to increase participation would be to increase publicity about the CHSPE. (Author/CTM)",

(1) The STEP may measure different skills than the CAT. (2) Norm groups may differ. (3) The STEP may not measure what the high schools are teaching. (4) Curriculum sequencing of AISD high schools may not conform to that of the norm group. (5) Cross-level curriculum planning between elementary, junior high, and senior high levels may not be coordinated. (6) The AISD population may differ from the national population and hence from the norms. (7) Test familiarity may play a  role in score differences. (8) The STEP is a more difficult test than the CAT. (9) The time of year of the administration may have depressed STEP scores. (10) Administration procedures differed from those used in the norming study. Of the ten variables considered, all but number 3 and possibly number 4 were accepted as possible explanations for the score differences.

        "description":"A live tailored testing study was conducted to compare the results of using either the one-parameter logistic model or the three-parameter logistic model to measure the performance of college students on multiple choice vocabulary items. The results of the study showed the three-parameter tailored testing procedure to be superior to the one-parameter procedure on the basis of goodness of fit of observed to predicted item responses, test-retest reliability, convergence to stable ability estimates, and test information. No differences were found in the prediction of an outside criterion. However, implicit in these results was the assumption that the nonconvergence problem encountered in one-third of the cases for the three-parameter procedure could be solved. Thus, based on the  data reported in this study, the three-parameter tailored testing method was deemed the technique of choice, at least for unidimensional tests consisting of multiple choice items where guessing is a factor.

        "description":"In May and June of each year, Soviet students who have completed grades one through ten face a final examination in each of the major subjects which they have studied. The examinations are constructed by the ministries of education in the Soviet republics and are submitted to the individual school district authorities. The type, form, and purpose of the examination are relatively constant each year. The examinations are aimed at verifying the amount of knowledge acquired by the students upon completion of their secondary education, and reflect an effort to have students master a prescribed amount of knowledge from textbooks, other required readings, and practical work. Each pupil selects a card bearing the questions he or she will answer; the student must provide the answers  orally, and when appropriate, on the blackboard. Answers are judged by a committee composed of the school director, teachers, and an official from the local district education department. This booklet provides an outline of the course content covered by the 1964 examinations in algebra, geometry, physics, chemistry, history of the USSR and social sciences, and foreign languages (English, German, and French).

Measures devised or published after July, 1974, or those used only in foreign surveys are not included. The compendium focuses on measures of peoples' attitudes rather than their behavior, and covers sex roles in specific institutional areas (including the family, the labor force, the educational system, the political system, and the military). Items are categorized by the way in which women vs. men should behave or be treated within the institution, perception of actual treatment of men and women within the institutional context, and respondent's action orientation towards, or recommendations for change in, the  institution. These categories are also used to organize items having a general sex role reference rather than an institutional one. These items encompass attitudes towards general norms about the behavior of men and women (with a focus on primary group situations), sex trait stereotypes, discrimination, and the women's liberation movement. References to at least one study or article in which the measure is used are given for each item. (Author/JAC)",

        "description":"A model is proposed for memory that stresses a distinction between episodic memory for encoded personal experience and semantic memory for abstractors and generalizations. Basically, the model holds that questions influence the nature of memory representations formed during instruction, and that memory representation controls the way in which stored knowledge can be used. The paper is divided into three major sections. In the first section various proposed typologies of questions are described, to identify the dimensions along whcih questions may vary and to describe both the utility and inadequacies of current typologies. It is argued that an instructionally useful taxonomy must be based upon consideration of the empirical effects of questions, and that development of such a  taxonomy is a fundamental goal of research on levels of questions. In the second section the limited research on levels of questions is reviewed, to integrate what is known and not known about the effects of asking different types of questions during instruction. Both deficiencies in the existing studies and promising directions for future research are indicated. The third section briefly presents the information-processing model of knowledge acquisition and attempts to relate question-level effects to the model. (Author/CTM)",

Data were gathered on both a pre- and post-release basis for a large number of variables via institutional records, personal interviews, test administrations and rating forms. One hundred thirty-three inmates were traced after release and interviewed five to six months later to determine their employment status and social adjustment. Participants in educational programs were classified as follows: adult basic education or general educational development  (45 persons); vocational education (35); postsecondary education (13); no enrollment (35); and unclassified (5 persons). Among the variables studied were: employment status, employment adjustment, general social adjustment, and absconding/recidivism. Ex-offenders enrolled in post-secondary education programs were found to have violated parole and/or been arrested significantly fewer times than were those in the no-enrollment control group. Except for this finding, no overall consistent pattern of significant differences were observed among any of the groups. Implications are drawn for a re-examination of the goals of educational programs at state correctional institutions. A number of questionnaires and interview forms are appended. (Author/CTM)",

A questionnaire was administered to determine the type of professional activity engaged in by the requestor; how the requestor became aware of the document; whether the requestor belonged to ERIC/TM's target  population; receipt of the document; reading vs. scanning; and document quality and utility. Indicators of quality were document length, organization, writing, and format. Utility was judged according to the purpose for ordering the document, whether the document was passed on (if so, to whom and what for), and the document's impact on the requestor's subsequent work activities. User evaluations of ERIC/TM's products tend to be high and indicate that the publications are used as reference tools by educators to keep abreast of the literature.

The fan spread hypothesis is assumed for groups but not necessarily assumed for members of the groups. Sample standard deviations provide a biased estimate of treatment effects when the first procedure is used with small samples and poorly correlated measures. Under a nonlinear model of within-group growth, the true score analysis of covariance underadjusts for initial group differences. Under the assumption of linear within-group growth and with large samples, both methods estimate the desired effect with equal precision. When samples are  small, neither of the two methods are appropriate for the nonlinear model of within-group growth. (Author/CTM)",

The school is located in a low socioeconomic neighborhood with a population of 600 students identified as low achievers. Language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies were the major content areas in this curriculum designed for kindergarten through sixth grade. Data from interviews, questionnaires, and standardized test scores were gathered during the 1973-74 and 1974-75 school years to determine whether the following major program objectives were met: (1) stimulate students to an average of one grade level's growth per year; (2) to encourage students to come to  conclusions in the affective domain; (3) to develop a media center which facilitates variations in learning styles; and (4) to involve parents in decision-making activities. In addition to academic assessment, two instruments were constructed to measure student self-concept. Results indicate that students surpassed the test author's expectations in both the 1974 and 1975 school years; that students achieved one grade level's growth per year; and that PLAN is a viable alternative school. Increased inservice training for PLAN teachers was recommended, as well as the use of criterion referenced achievement tests. (JAC)",

Most Americans give lip service to the principles of democracy in education, but resist their implementation. Yet, multiracial schools are essential if all children are to have the opportunity to survive and thrive in our society. One of the most recent obstacles to equal, quality education is the Supreme Court's reversal of the Bradley Vs. Milliken decision, which maintains that the original judge erred in ordering a metropolitan Detroit desegregation plan without evidence of segregation in the suburban districts. It is evident, nonetheless, that urban communities have become black and  minority enclaves which are ringed by all white suburbs. Another barrier to school desegregation has been school boards' determination to maintain the segregated status quo. Discrimination also occurs when tests are allowed to predict academic success. Student and teacher racial attitudes are clearly related to all the above factors. Educators must work against these forces of discrimination. Teacher training programs should ensure that future teachers understand minority cultures and problems. (Author/MC)",

The children, taken from thirty classrooms in six different elementary schools, responded to a questionnaire suitable for non-readers. An experimenter read 18 questions to the children who marked an answer with visual representations of boys or girls. Children were asked whether boys, girls, or both boys and girls were perceived in certain classroom roles. The research inference was that if one sex or the other was perceived by the children to predominate, then sex stereotyping might be attributed to the area of the question. The children's responses indicated that sex stereotyping is very much a part of the elementary school  curriculum. Certain activities are being limited, not by a child's ability but by gender, and a differential system of reward and punishment is being applied on the basis of sex. The only area in which children reported little sex stereotyping was in their perception of who was smarter. (Author/EB)",

This goal can be met through teacher education, integration of multicultural concepts into the curriculum in appropriate contexts, and the development of improved curriculum materials. Multicultural studies must begin in the primary grades, as research indicates that children's attitudes toward other nations and peoples tend to stabilize by early adolescence. These studies can be combined with mastery of the basic skills, for if the child cannot read and comprehend his assignments, or express her feelings clearly in speaking and writing, the multicultural activities  will be less effective. With mastery of basic skills, with unbiased and broad-based texts, and with greater understanding of the values of cultural diversity, the child and the teacher will be able to view more critically and thoughtfully those issues, events, behaviors and beliefs that make up Canada today.

        "description":"The major explanations for the narrowing in wage differentials between blacks and whites can be placed under four general categories: (1) more recent black cohorts begin their job experiences with larger initial stocks of human capital than previous cohorts; (2) the rural South to urban North migration has partly been superceded by Southern blacks moving to what are now economically vibrant Southern cities; (3) the effects of government affirmative action; and (4) changes in other aspects of the market such as the choice of full or part-time work, unique characteristics of certain occupations, and biases due to sample censoring. The rise in the ratio of black to white male and female wages is largely explained by converging nominal characteristics, with education playing the  dominant role. Although migration accounts for only nine percent of the relative wage growth of black men and women, the South dominates regional comparisons. Relative black/ white ratios for both sexes have risen more rapidly in the South, especially among the young. As with migration, affirmative action programs were not a major contributor to rising relative wages. However, direct and indirect government employment, combined with the adoption of full-time jobs, the elimination of domestic services as their primary function, and rising educational levels, have contributed significantly to the remarkable wage advances of black women.

Four major problems with Cleveland's affirmative action plan are described: (1) the failure to identify specific problem areas in Cleveland's employment policies and practices which account for underutilization of women and minorities; (2) the failure to establish and implement action programs that would eliminate discrimination against women and minorities; (3) the statement of goals for only a one year period; and (4) the failure of the city to devote sufficient resources for implementation of an  adequate affirmative action plan. Underutilization is described as the biggest factor in contract compliance deficiencies. It is stated that several of the largest beneficiaries of city business employ no minorities or women in professional, technical or administrative positions and most do not employ minorities or women at a rate that is even close to their representation in the Cleveland labor market. Also noted are inconsistencies in Federal agency grant requirements and regulations enforcement. Recommendations for redressing these problems are made. Appended are responses by various Cleveland officials and organizations to the charges of discrimination made in this report. (Author/EB)",

Also reviewed are some of the studies of experimental schools. Prior research is placed in the context of a critique which argues that more detailed information is needed about the quality of everyday life in the programs rather than on traditional evaluative measures of outcomes. The paper has two stated purposes: first, to dispel some of the popular misconceptions about alternative schools by describing various programs and practices that use that term; and second, to impose some conceptual order on the large number of alternatives through a review of some of the dimensions along which  these schools vary. The data on alternative schools were gathered through the author's personal experience and through a review of the literature. It is suggested that more ethnographic research be conducted on alternative schools. (Author/AM)",

Among the most frequently cited correlates of white withdrawal is the level of black concentration. The present study re-examines the relationship between the percent of black enrollment and white enrollment change at both the district and the school levels. The analysis focuses on 77 districts and approximately 2,300 schools located in southern Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas. Higher black enrollments are found to be associated with white withdrawal at both the district and the school levels. In both cases this relationship appears to be curvilinear with a threshold roughly at 30 percent black. Above that point, white enrollments decline  exponentially with increases in the percent of black enrollment. The most important implication of this study is that, on the average, districts with enrollments less than approximately 30 percent black can be desegregated without drastic declines in white enrollment.

Two historical periods, post World War I and post World War II, were chosen to provide a wide data base which could be analyzed over time. With seven American literature professors' aid, works of literary merit with a middle-aged male protagonist were selected. The sample included eight novels and four plays, half from each period. (For example, among those included were: &quot;The Professor's House,&quot;&quot;They Knew What They Wanted,&quot;&quot;Herzog,&quot; and &quot;Death of a Salesman.&quot;) Grounded theory, a research methodology which emphasizes theory discovery rather than theory verification, was used to study male mid-life and to uncover new insights. Emerging from the literature review were five  major developmental categories and their characteristic properties. Major categories included aging awareness, meaning search, generation squeeze, career malaise, and ego rejuvenation. Comparative data analysis revealed that mid-life coping can be an uncomfortable, sometimes painful, endeavor. New insights discovered were related to what it means to be the middle of three generations, the importance of peer/spouse confirmation of one's aging, and the rejuvenation function of the mentor relationship.

This study presents a comparison of stocks and flows of occupational listings in help wanted ads and listings placed with the public employment service (ES) by local employers. Comparisons are made at the end of each of twelve months in twelve labor market areas (Atlanta, Boise, Dayton, etc.). Employers using one or the other or both medium(s) are identified. Volume comparisons are made for occupational and industrial makeup and between geographic areas. Analysis is made of the impact of low-pay, low-status occupations on intermediaries, and the effect of mandatory listings on the ES. Findings include twenty-three  highlights: (1) on first encounter, the ES and want ads have approximately the same listings volume of jobs available to job seekers; (2) a daily visit to ES exposes job seekers to 1.2 additional jobs during remaining monthly work days; (3) want ads receive almost three times more new listings than ES in twenty-eight days, and higher volume in all occupations; etc. The findings are thought to be germane to considerations of amending the Wagner-Peyser Act.

Intending to lead a career education advocate through the process of implementing a product, these steps include establishing incremental objectives, profiling influential elements, selecting appropriate implementation techniques, timing and sequencing the actions, initiating the actions, assessing the impact of the actions, and reformulating the strategy. The techniques section contains ideas  for influencing others to accept career education. The techniques have been ordered in three modes: informative techniques, persuasive techniques, and directive techniques.

Data collection was designed to obtain information including parental socioeconomic status, mental ability, academic performance, and significant others' occupational and educational expectations. Information about significant others was collected from a sample of racially-balanced, female high school sophomores and from their significant others. The females were also asked to indicate home-career expectations. Three of the six most salient findings are as follow: significant other variables were observed to be the most accurate predictors of career-choice  variables; the home-career expectation of females did not manifest strong effects on educational or occupational expectation; and significant other variables did not affect educational and occupational expectation for females more strongly than for males. (A companion document, CE 016 577, reports and compares the findings for black and white males.) Thirteen hypotheses regarding the effects of sex-role differentiation based on the literature review were analyzed, and implications for research and theory are presented.

        "description":"A five-year study of effectiveness in work roles had four general objectives: (1) to assess associations between aspects of working conditions and indicators of employees' work role effectiveness; (2) to identify personal and situational characteristics that limit associations between working conditions and effectiveness; (3) to begin to map the statistical structure of associations among various classes of effectiveness measures; and (4) to assess the validity of effectiveness indicators when measured in different ways and tested against different causal factors. Major methodological findings were that information from different sources regarding working conditions and worker behavior is in agreement only for relatively unambiguous and external aspects of work. As the  abstractness and, thus, potential ambiguity of a measure increase, assessments from workers, observers, and supervisors become increasingly liable to judgmental biases, such as the halo effect. Major substantive results include identification of stress effects upon worker attitudes and behaviors, including a withdrawal syndrome that begins with frequent absences and culminates in voluntary turnover. (Twenty-one chapters, each a self-contained paper including methodological information and citation of sources, comprise this final report. It is divided into two parts. Part I presents chapters on methodological topics including defining, measuring, and assessing the quality of employment, and assessing work environments with observational methods. Part II, employee responses to work  environments, has three sections: work role stress and strain; motivation and rewards; and compatibility of work roles and life roles.

In section 2 the need for involving students in developmental and comprehensive work related sequences is affirmed. Section 3 defines the target population as all teachers and learners. Career education responsibilities, as stated in section 4, belong to the total instructional staff. Section 5 focuses on career education as a systematic and developmental part of the total school program. The next four sections discuss aids to teaching/learning  adjustment. Section 6 emphasizes a teaching philosophy which includes positive work habits, teaching strategies, and values. In section 7, the teacher's attention to the learning purpose is stressed. Techniques providing work related experiences are described. Section 8 advises planners and teachers on how to infuse career education into school programs. Examples of basic skills and career related activities are given for grades 3, 8, and 11.

Based on a sample collected from February through May 1977 of 11,366 client files from sixty-nine sites located in fifteen states, it was found that seventy-one percent of the total WIN population are  unassigned recipients, and that within the program they rarely progress to another status. Although seventy-one percent of the unassigned recipients consider themselves job ready, their employability is being impeded by barriers such as age and ethnic origin (males under twenty and Spanish-origin females form the largest number in this category); lack of resources and insufficient job openings at the local WIN sites; lack of supportive services such as child care; and medical problems. Recommendations to aid in the removal of these obstacles are offered. (ELG)",

To this end, the project announced 3,600 reports and 1,189 projects in the bimonthly publications, AIM/ARM and &quot;Resources in Vocational Education&quot; (RIVE), during the three-year contract period. It produced seven instructional materials catalogs, eighteen topical bibliographies, fourteen unpublished interpretative papers, three integrative analyses, and six special publications. Project staff made twenty presentations to national and regional meetings, collaborated with fourteen agencies and  organizations, and conducted 106 literature searches. Major emphasis was given to improving the quality of input to information systems, helping users improve project design and education programs by using information, and redesigning the bimonthly publication. The project's focus on data base building, knowledge transformation, and information services will be continued by the National Center for Research in Vocational Education. (Author/EM)",

Chapter 2 reviews the Department of Labor's activities during fiscal year 1977, with emphasis on programs mandated by the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) of 1973. Also reviewed are the President's economic stimulus package, special target group programs, Work Incentive Program (WIN),  apprenticeship programs, employment services, unemployment compensation, and food stamps. The next two chapters focus on special employment problems of youth and middle-aged and older persons. Youth Employment and Demonstration Projects Act (YEDPA) goals are summarized, and the differing participation trends between men and women in the labor force are viewed in light of recent income security legislative initiatives. Chapter 5 examines the labor market impacts made by immigrants since the late 19th century, especially since 1965.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to review existing human operator modeling techniques and evaluate their potential utility for performance measurement applications (e.g., to support the type of flight simulation research that entails accounting for the perception and utilization of various cues). The major human operator characteristics that ought to be accounted for by a useful model were identified: psychological refractory period, operator intermittency, range effect, inadvertent crosscoupling, bang-bang control, and cue utilization. Existing models were then categorized, surveyed, and summarized. The categories of models surveyed include describing functions, optimal control model, discrete and finite state methods, adaptive techniques, preview models, and other nonlinear  approaches. Models in each category were evaluated based on the extent to which they represented the identified human operator characteristics as well as other aspects of their general validity for performance measurement applications. Results were that none of the models implemented more than a few of the human operator characteristics; many were based on assumptions that were unacceptable for measurement applications; and others had not been developed far enough to justify their use as a point of departure for measurement. It was concluded that existing models were not sufficiently representative of known characteristics of human behavior to be useful for general application in performance measurement.

This report updates the information contained in &quot;Tomorrow's Manpower Needs&quot; Supplement 3 by substituting 1970 census data (occupational codes) for the 1960 base used in the earlier study. The first section outlines the characteristics of four occupational and educational classification systems: the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) National/State Matrix system occupational classification; the Bureau of  Census occupational classification; Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) classification and codes; and the Office of Education (OE) classification. The next section describes the conversion tables including the source of data, and the construction, interpretation, and limitations of the table. The bulk of the report is the two sets of tables: (1) the Conversion of National/State Matrix titles to the vocational education classification system; and (2) vocational educational instructional programs and related National/State Matrix titles. The first lists National/State Matrix titles (e.g., each subheading under &quot;professional, technical, and kindred workers&quot;) and corresponding 1970 census code, vocational education system code and program title, and DOT code and title. The second table  then converts Matrix titles to OE instructional program codes and titles (e.g., &quot;agricultural and biological technicians, except health&quot;) to chemical technology in the technical education program area.

The report, divided into four chapters, describes intake and assessment in chapter 1. Intake is defined as any process controlling the enrollee's flow into a program at a rate maintaining optimum enrollment levels. Three assessment levels are outlined: (1) judging eligibility for admission, (2) matching client to activity, and (3) using diagnostics for individualization of services. It is suggested that in designing intake and assessment activities, elements to be considered are sufficient information, cost-effectiveness considerations, and assessment functions. Chapter 2 presents an overview of  assessment instruments and their limitations. In chapter 3 program model variations are described as evolving from the intensity of the assessment process, from the management activity (to maximize cost-effectiveness), and from the purpose(s) of the intake and assessment process. Nine intake and assessment models reflecting assessment level, multi-functional extent, and single or multi-agency effort are represented. Chapter 4 reviews selection, services, assessment systems, assessment devices, and client screening methods. A bibliography and three appendixes, including a summary of assessment tools for the disadvantaged, are attached. (This is one of a series of CETA program models.) (CSS)",

A questionnaire was sent to all 1,439 nursing schools in the country to obtain a picture of their admission policies and practices. To facilitate analysis of this data, a sample of twenty schools, representing various types of programs and different geographical locations, was selected for site visits and in-depth interviews with administrators and faculty. Another questionnaire was mailed to the more than 2,400 1974 applicants to these twenty schools. The following  recommendations were made at the conclusion of the study: (1) to gain wider and more comprehensive recruitment, pool manpower resources with local schools and expand the geographic scope of recruitment coverage; (2) find methods of dealing with insufficient funding; for instance, incorporate the nursing school information into the school's general catalog rather than publish it separately; (3) develop recruitment of minority students, providing them with special brochures and encouraging them to apply early; (4) canvas the community for alternative sources of financial assistance to students; and (5) increase efforts to redirect applicants to other programs.

Four major characteristics of such letters are discussed: (1) brevity and the avoidance of needless words and information; (2) the use of plain, everyday language, which means letter writers must possess a thorough understanding of the subject so that they can confidently use nontechnical language in place of specialized terms; (3) strength, which requires the use of concrete, specific words and a logical organization of ideas; and (4) sensitivity, which calls for a human, personal approach. Specific examples of phrases and words  to be avoided are included as well as simple paraphrases to substitute for awkward, wordy, or technical terminology. Methods for planning and organizing a business reply are outlined, stressing the importance of its three main components: the opening, which should immediately stimulate the reader's interest; the body, which should contain the progression of thought necessary for a complete answer; and the closing, which should summarize the contents and propose any recommendations.

        "description":"This booklet was designed to help supervisors with employee training problems. The problems may relate to upgrading job knowledge and skills or other training areas. The supervisor can share the training workload with fellow supervisors, the larger organization, and the personnel officer. Knowledge of an enthusiasm for the training subject will also aid him. The supervisor needs to observe, analyze, and measure employee production and to determine what is expected of employees before he can train toward a defined level. He attempts to select methods consonant with the trainee's background and abilities. The supervisor makes rough training plans, invites appropriate input, and then draws up specific training plans. His on-the-job training methods follow four steps: prepare, tell,  show, and follow up. The supervisor joins trainees in making the training worthwhile, and he evaluates during and following training to measure training effects. The supervisor assists employees in developing insight to cope with change. Employee skills training is necessary, but supervisory training is just as necessary. Personnel management areas, valuable in supervisory training, include equal employment opportunity, labor-management relations, etc. The training quantity and quality is largely dependent on the supervisor's leadership.

Data from the National Longitudinal Survey of the Labor Force Experience of Young Men were used to examine employment among men aged sixteen to twenty-eight in different levels and fields of work. Results suggest that the rate of labor force participation stabilizes in the early twenties, differentiation among men by education and the distribution of men among different broad levels and fields of work stabilizes by the mid-twenties, and the sorting of men with different socioeconomic backgrounds into different occupational groups continues through the late twenties, at which age it appears to have been largely completed. Discriminant  analyses reveal that academic achievement (IQ and years of education) is the major dimension by which men are sorted or sort themselves to jobs, but socioeconomic background also helps to distinguish among men in different fields as well as levels of work.

A sample of inner-city Puerto Ricans who attended the eighth grade in two schools in Wilmington, Delaware, in the 1966-1971 period was chosen and interviewed. Small control groups of blacks and whites were used also. Two multiple regression models of success are developed; one uses highest wage and the other uses the wage adjusted for job stability and type of job as dependent variables. The significant major determinants of success are years of school, number of children, and race. Attitude toward work, extent of career planning, and years lived in Puerto Rico also can influence success. Puerto Rican young men do worse than blacks  and much worse than whites in the labor market. Other forms of human capital investment, including job training, do not seem to matter. Unemployment is high but is voluntary. The young man sees racial discrimination hindering his labor market progress. To raise the success level, public policy should focus on making schools and job training more effective, provide better counseling and market information, and expand the availability of &quot;good jobs.&quot; Present macro-economic job programs are of little value.

Part II consists of individual service industry studies: advertising,  automotive services, banking/other financial services, educational services, health/medical services, hotels/motels, life insurance, motion pictures, personal services, wholesale trade, nonfood retailing, and food retailing. The advertising study, for example, looks at advertising in the present and future and examines the ad agency's changing character, competitiveness, and responses to consumerism and special service agencies. A 1963-1974 advertising expenditure chart is also included. At the end of part II, 1972 census data are presented for selected service industries, retail trades, and wholesale trades. (CSS)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to examine race and sex differences in occupational aspirations and the role of these differences in perpetuating under- or overrepresentation of women and blacks in different occupations. The underrepresentation of women, especially blacks, in all levels of entrepreneurial jobs was stressed since these jobs constitute a large proportion of all jobs and pay better for less education than other fields. Data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress regarding occupational aspirations, values, and self-reported competencies of thirteen-year-olds, seventeen-year-olds, and adults aged twenty-six to thirty-five were used to examine race and sex differences in orientation to particular types of occupations. Based on these results, speculations were  presented about how people adjust their occupational goals in ways that help perpetuate occupational segregation. The following five principles were formulated: (1) society-wide stereotypes about good jobs are mirrored in the occupational aspirations of children; (2) stereotypes about occupations appropriate for men are different from those for women; (3) these stereotypes are largely the same for all racial and ethnic groups; (4) as children go through adolescence their aspirations become more realistic; (5) and the races and sexes adjust their aspirations towards different sets of occupations. The data implied that strategies to decrease occupational segregation by decreasing educational handicaps will not eradicate all important differences and recommended that more attention be  devoted to understanding the socialization processes that lead the races and sexes to seek different jobs.

        "description":"This report reviews the literature as it relates to the use of platform motion systems in flight simulators for flying training. Motion is discussed in terms of its effect on compensatory, pursuit, and precognitive tasks, within both the simulator and transfer contexts. Although both skilled and unskilled behaviors are addressed, the former are emphasized. The report concludes that for most tasks, platform motion is not required to produce rapid, efficient, economical training and that other, less expensive means of imparting motion information are equally viable alternatives. The following are recommended: (1) Whenever feasible and affordable, simulator systems should be equipped with the largest field-of-view visual system that is consistent with mission requirements, and (2)  simulators that do not include a platform motion system can be safely procured for most aircraft without compromising training effectiveness.

        "description":"In this paper evidence on the causal connection between employment of women and sex-role attitudes is presented and evaluated. The effects of sex-role attitudes on labor force participation are reviewed, and changes in sex-role attitudes during the next fifteen years are projected. Information on the relationship between sex-role attitudes and labor market activity is used to make tentative projections of female labor force participation to 1990. The results of this analysis indicate that, if no further changes have taken place in individual attitudes toward sex roles since the early 1970's, succession of cohorts should result in an increase in female labor force participation of two to four percentage points by 1990. Also, if there is a continued trend toward acceptance by  individuals of work roles for women during this period, then a rise in female labor force participation of nineteen to twenty-two points is implied by the results. The implications of these findings are discussed. (Author/CSS)",

It covers such subjects as minority group employment, employment of women, white-collar workers' occupations, blue-collar workers' occupations, pay structure, geographic distribution, and monthly manpower and pay reports. In the first of four parts, the introduction states that the report presents and analyzes educational attainment data for male and female full-time permanent General Schedule employees--federal civilian employees within their minority/non-minority groups. Part 2 defines the data parameters and study population. In part 3 statistics are given for educational attainment of General Schedule employees by minority/non-minority group and by sex. For  instance, an educational attainment by minority group overview reveals that the Oriental group has the highest educational level, followed by the non-minority group. Black, Spanish-surnamed, and American Indian groups had considerably smaller percentages of employees with higher education. Part 4 compares Civil Service Commission data with U.S. Census data. Also, comparisons with Census data for employed white-collar workers are presented. Eleven text tables and eleven figures provide quantitative data throughout the document. Twelve tables based on the Civil Service Commission Central Personnel Data File and three based on U.S. Census data are appended. (CSS)",

The first study was done to determine the effects of the opportunity to earn points toward the course grade. There were no differences between incentive and no-incentive students on any measure. Experiment 2 was designed to investigate the effects of student-selected incentive on student's posttest performance and study time across two instructional tasks related to course content. Incentive students performed better than no-incentive students on program subtests which required stating lists of rules that could be committed to memory. Experiment 3 was done to determine the effects of a highly preferred  incentive, release from final examination, when used under instructional procedures in a two-week instructional unit. Effects of the incentive were studied on posttest performance, study time, student-initiated contact with instructor, and student attitude toward the incentives used. Students in the no-incentive condition scored higher than incentive students on a constructed-response subtest that required new rules applications. The evidence suggests that incentives are effective for memory-type tasks, particularly when the student is aware that rehearsal and memory are task requirements. (CSS)",

From April 1976 through December 1977 data were collected in the Las Vegas, Nevada, area from 435 light-duty fleet vehicles driven in typical highway and urban environments. More than six million test vehicle-miles were accumulated in the course of the project. The test results support the hypothesis. However, the magnitude of the improvements (four to six percent) is less than had been achieved in earlier tests conducted by others (ten to twenty percent). This difference may be attributable to the fact that  motivational and performance feedback techniques were deliberately omitted from the test environment. Additionally, smaller improvements in fuel economy also appeared in the untreated control groups, suggesting that driver knowledge of the test and informal information exchange among drivers about fuel-efficient driving techniques may have influenced the results.

The study was done to determine whether performance factor variance was so restricted that the performance factors would not provide useful information in the rating process. Also of interest was the extent to which performance factor ratings relate to evaluation of potential ratings and whether any factor could be eliminated from the system due to its insignificant contribution. Results show each of ten performance factors has a mean rating of over 4.4 on a 5-point scale. Over sixty-three percent of the ratings are in the well-above-standard block and twenty-three percent are  in the above-standard block. Deletion of no single performance factor from the rating system can be justified because of insufficient variance. Performance factors intercorrelated moderately among themselves. An optimally weighted sum of combined ratings account for forty-five percent of variance in evaluation of potential ratings. No single factor made a significant independent contribution to the prediction level. It appears that raters could provide evaluation of potential ratings of the same quality if one or a small subset of performance factors were deleted from the system. (Author/CSS)",

Objectives were to use new microprocessor technology to produce one terminal that is more effective and efficient than either the management terminal or the plasma type interactive terminal presently in use by the Air Force Advanced Instructional System (AIS). Four goals were identified: (1) design and develop a final configuration which takes into account stand-alone software capabilities for supporting block testing, portability (battery operation), and transfer of data to the computer site through a type B terminal; (2) refine the existing prototype for production level numbers, and produce ten prototype production units with a production cost goal of approximately $500.00 per  unit in quantities of 500 or more; (3) perform a classroom study of the microterminal to determine its operational effectiveness; and (4) provide complete procurement-manufacturing documentation. Through involvement of educators, psychologists, engineers, and potential microterminal users, the human factors were defined, mechanical and electrical characteristics of the microterminal selected, and the prototype designed. The microterminal was evaluated and proved acceptable for student test taking in the AID weapons mechanics course. Cost analysis indicated that it met the goal. Students showed a large preference for answering test items with the microterminal rather than computer test forms. Evaluation results also showed the use of the microterminal resulted in significantly better test  scores. (JH)",

Teachers of approximately 400 fourth and fifth grade children received a six-session inservice training workshop as an experimental intervention; teachers of approximately 400 children served as controls. Results indicate that children whose school experience includes having a man as a teacher, having a woman as a unit leader, having a woman as a principal, knowing women who supervise men and knowing women doctors are more likely to hold more egalitarian beliefs about sex differences, intelligence, job  discrimination, working women, and domestic roles and to have positive attitudes about cross-sex friendship and work choices. Similarly, children whose teachers do not group by sex, whose teachers assign them school work in mixed-sex groups, who play sports and engage in clubs in sex-integrated groups, and whose parents are supportive of cross-sex friendships are more likely to have cross-sex friendship choices, cross-sex work partner choices, and to approve of cross-sex interaction in general, as well as to hold less stereotyped attitudes regarding men's and women's roles in work and society.

Approximately half of the children were randomly selected as treatment subjects and were pretested with an instrument designed to measure sex-role attitudes. Treatment consisted of a series of stories which were written as sex-role reversed with regard to occupation. Posttests were administered one-to-two weeks after treatment and approximately a year later. The multivariate main effect for the treatment group was significant in all schools.

Two versions of the PAQ (in English and Spanish) have been developed, one for adults and a second for children. The child version is designed to be used with children from age 7-11. Adolescents and adults normally use the Adult PAQ. The validity and reliability of the Adult PAQ and Child PAQ (English versions) have been shown to be adequate. A sample of 147 college students was used to assess the  validity and reliability of the Adult PAQ. A sample of 220 fourth and fifth graders was used to assess the validity and reliability of the Child PAQ. Internal consistency results and factor analysis results are reported for both testing samples. Concurrent, convergent, and discriminant validities of the scales were found to be adequate. Both versions of the PAQ are susceptible to social desirability and acquiescence in children's and adults' responses to some PAQ scales. (Author)",

Examples are presented illustrating ways in which the model has been modified and used with success in a variety of situations. Some of the major elements in the Woodard model discussed in this article include outreach groups, activity orientation, small group size, self-determination, self-disciplining, and group consensus. The Woodard model of outreach counseling through self-determined activities is a valuable tool not only for counselors but for any leader of small groups. One value lies in the methodology, i.e., activity-orientation,  self-determination, and self-discipline, which is easily understood and may be practiced without a need for a leader who holds an academic degree and official certification. Secondly, self-determined activities provide a natural environment for social interchange and resultant personal growth. Thirdly, the leader can influence activities and behaviors in such a way that they contain skills for social change. Finally, students choose activity-oriented groups in counseling over non-directive or other interview types of counseling groups. (Author)",

However, it also finds that many students misperceive their tracks and they do not adequately take account of their track placements and class ranks in formulating their college plans. Consequently, many students' college expectations--even in senior year--are unrealistic and go unfulfilled after graduation. These findings clearly indicate the need for schools to inform students better about these selection practices and their implications for students' future educational attainments.  (Author)",

        "description":"Alcoholism is becoming an increasingly significant problem for women. At one time, women rarely drank and the female alcoholic was an anomaly. Estimates of the total number of women alcoholics in the United States today are over 900,000. Women now constitute from 20 to 35% of all alcoholics in this country. This paper attempts to gain understanding of psychological factors which may underlie female alcoholism. The approach used was to apply a theoretical model derived from social psychology: attribution theory. In order to assess causal attributions, expectancies, and affect, a group of alcoholics were asked to state their causal attributions for a number of success or failure achievement and interpersonal situations. Their responses were compared with those of the general  population. The alcoholic sample included 41 male and 28 female recovering alcoholics in a halfway house treatment center. The nonalcoholic sample included 31 males and 33 females recruited from neighborhoods similar to the former neighborhoods of the alcoholic subjects. Alcoholics of both sexes saw success most resulting from effort. Female alcoholics saw failure as more due to their personalities than to lack of effort. Employment seemed to be a particularly important situation for understanding alcoholic attributions. (Author/JL)",

This study attempts to determine if the achievement attribution model is supported in an actual classroom setting with college students actually taking an important exam. Participants were 35 volunteers from an introductory social psychology course. Three short questionnaires were completed: one pre-test, one post-test but before the student knew the test score, and the third after the individual test scores and class distribution of scores were returned. The students did slightly worse than they expected or wanted to do. The majority attributed the cause of their exam outcome to effort. The results gave only limited support for the attribution model of expectancy  changes being mediated by the stability of the causal attribution. Affect and self-reward were positively correlated with effort and ability ratings. Contrary to prediction, the highest correlations were not for the intentional effort attribution but rather for ability. Affect and self-reward were more related to subjective appraisals of success than objective performance. The results showed that the theoretical attribution model was generally supported, but suggested a far more complex model of attributions in the classroom than originally expected. (Author/JL)",

The first paper explores the effects of the laws on heroin use. It analyzes the trends of various indicators of heroin use in New York State over a period of several years. In order to isolate movements unique to New York, these trends are compared with those of comparable indicators for other East Coast states and cities that were not directly affected by the new drug laws. The second paper is on crime committed by narcotics users in Manhattan. It presents the findings of a study of changes in the magnitude of felony crimes committed by narcotics users in Manhattan between 1971 and 1975. The crimes included are all felonies which directly affect victims.  The third paper explores the effects of the 1973 drug laws on the New York State Courts. It is concerned primarily with implementation of the statutes dealing with possession or sale of dangerous drugs. The last paper is on sentencing patterns under the 1973 New York State drug laws.

The study was undertaken by the Joint Committee on New York Drug Law Evaluation, established by the Association of the Bar of the City of New York and the Drug Abuse Council, Inc. The volume has three main sections. The first section explores the effects of the 1973 drug law on drug use, crime, cost to the state, incarceration of young people, recruitment of informants, and rate of commitments to state prisons. The second section attempts to account for the disappointing results of the 1973 drug law. The criminal justice process as a whole did not seem to increase the threat to the offender. Court delays also reduced the threat. The third section  contains observations and lessons for the future. It examines the difficulties of implementation, what could have been done to improve implementation, and possibility for future improvement. (Author/JL)",

The questionnaires and personality inventories yielded the following findings: (1) women purusing a more independent career and working in child-related areas make statements about satisfactions with children consistent with other research findings, such as enjoyment of watching children's development; (2) parents among this group are more concerned with failure, worries and fears than are nonparents; (3) multiple regression analysis confirms the need to describe an individual's  fertility from a set of content domains rather than limiting the predictors to one specific set of motivations alone; (4) the California Psychological Inventory is useful in fertility research; and (5) satisfactions with children which were mentioned by participants were basically unrelated to the experiences they had had with their own children.

The Bill proposes a five-year extension of the Act with amendments to clarify its purposes and to permit multiple-year funding of alcohol and drug abuse education projects. The Bill suggests that the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Education Act should assist, through grants and contracts, the development of programs which: (1) focus on causes rather than symptoms of drug and alcohol abuse; (2) aim at primary prevention and early intervention in schools; and (3) conduct training for educational and community personnel and law enforcement officials. It also recommends that all of the activities  authorized by the Act be carried out at all levels of the community. Inherent in this program is the concept of school-team approach. (EV)",

Approximately 60% of the sample came from chaotic homes torn apart by family conflict. An assortative mating factor which may operate differently between the sexes is suggested, and the probability that female suicide attempters are self-selected and use this form of behavior as a legitimized way of bringing their marital disharmony to a head is indicated. The proportion of the total sample who were unemployed was striking. There was a clear association between coming from a disordered family background and subsequently living on welfare in  adult life, whereas those who came from a stable background were more often found to be supporting themselves. Some evidence exists, suggesting that a childhood background characterized by family strife and dissension is damaging to the development of personality (as exemplified in suicide attempters) and severly impairs the ability to form harmonious sexual partnerships as well as impairing the development of constructive attitudes and skills towards work and self-support.

Because they had never encountered dialect texts, these stories were taped and the children were asked questions orally, in order not to bias the results. The children were tested at three different levels of difficulty appropriate to their grade levels. No difference in total number of correct responses was found between the Creole and Standard English selections. This finding is consistent with the results of other studies done with both Black and Hawaiian children. An  important finding relating to reading achievement was that the children as groups comprehended story content poorly, even at their expected grade level. Since listening comprehension should be far above reading comprehension, it was suggested that more emphasis be given to increasing general comprehension skills in both listening and reading.

Results of instruction were measured by the number of objectives gained each quarter, the total number of objectives gained, the number of lessons taken for each objective, and scores on the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test, which was also given to three comparison groups. KEEP students learned many objectives, but at a relatively slow rate. On the Gates-MacGinitie, first graders scored 1.4 rather than the expected 1.9. Measures of student motivation indicated that motivation was high throughout the year, but this was not enough to raise students to grade level. Rate of learning increased over the year; statistics on initial  consonant learning indicated a learning-to-learn phenomenon rather than phonological interference. The results were interpreted as pointing to specific areas of further research: attention skills, training in language and cognitive skills to precede and accelerate reading achievement, and ways of teaching initial consonants.

        "description":"The oral reading errors of 15 second graders were analyzed to find out if strategies used by good and poor readers could be differentiated. Patterns of errors were identified, and it was found that good readers often used context cues, while poor readers relied heavily on visual-phonic information. It was also possible to identify good and poor readers by examining the percent of errors made in different categories. Possible differences between the KEEP (Kamehameha Early Education Program) students and subjects in other oral reading studies were noted: the KEEP students overall made more errors which did not fit into the context of the sentence. Finally, it was suggested that the KEEP children's curriculum should incorporate much more instruction in the use of context, since the  study seemed to demonstrate that their skill in this strategy is not easily developed.

        "description":"This report presents a summary of reading research conducted by the Kamehameha Early Education Program (KEEP) during 1972-75. Research was conducted in four areas: student industriousness, reading readiness, teaching of sound-symbol relationships, and language (especially dialect interference). With regard to industriousness, it was found that increasing industriousness was a necessary and important factor, although it was not sufficient to produce grade-level reading achievement. Investigations of reading readiness led to the conclusion that a structured and intensive readiness program, which allowed earlier introduction of formal reading instruction, bettered achievement. It was discovered that sound-symbol relationships which are integral to instruction with the phonic methods  were not easily learned by KEEP students. After a number of different methods of teaching these correspondences were tried, it was recommended that KEEP students not be taught to read with programs heavily emphasizing phonics. The results of several studies showed that speaking a dialect, Hawaii Creole, probably does not in itself interfere with learning to read at the beginning levels. Finally, a description of the reading curriculum currently being developed is given. (Author)",

Previous work on the structure of texts is first reviewed and problems with earlier formalisms and scoring methods are discussed. Analyses are then presented of the structure of three types of texts--short stories, instructions, and explanations--and three experiments are described in which differences in readers' recall of the different text types were assessed. In experiment one, 22 college students read and summarized six texts of different types and later recalled three of them; in experiments two and three, students heard tape-recorded texts, one at a time, performed a brief interfering task after each text, and then  recalled the text. Results of the experiments, which are reported and discussed, revealed that stories were the easiest, and definitions the most difficult, to recall and understand, and that recalls of definitions showed significantly more reordering than did recalls of instructions, which, in turn, had more reordering than did the recalls of stories. Forty-one illustrative figures and eight tables of results are included. (GW)",

After an introductory section, the paper first deals with listener analytic skills. Specifically it discusses adult performance and considers the egocentrism hypothesis with reference to age differences in communication accuracy, message contingency, self- versus other-communication, variation in listener attributes,  correlation with perspective taking measures, and training studies. Some attention is also given to component skills. The next section of the paper presents a discussion of task analytic skills as they relate to both adult and children's performance. Training studies in this area are also examined. The following section details message analytic skills, with a consideration of both listener and appraisal ability, and includes an analysis of feedback utilization. The final topic of discussion is referential communication and ecological validity. (FL)",

        "description":"In discussing the third national assessment of reading and literature, four major points can be made. First, norm-referenced tests and criterion-referenced tests ignore serious ethical and measurement problems, namely, we don't know enough about individual differences to do such testing and the outcome, social class tracking, is ethically repulsive. Second, comprehending and interpreting literary texts is a subset of reading not separate from it. Third, descriptive information from the national assessment survey is useful in considering notions about developmental differences in the ways students interpret and evaluate which are attributable to developmental growth, schooling, and personal inclinations. Fourth, domain-referenced assessment is the best standardized procedure for  finding out what students know and what teachers and schools can do. It eliminates the ambiguity created by behavior factors by representative sampling from a well-defined set of tasks, by referring to the logical relationship between a set of items in a test and a well-defined domain represented by those items, and by estimating the kinds of behavior students are capable of within a defined domain.

The subjects, 30 fourth-grade students from each category, each read one passage at the third-grade level and one at the fourth grade level; they were instructed to stop at the end of each sentence, tell whether the sentence had caused a picture to form in their mind and, if so, to describe the picture. Subjects' responses were analyzed in terms of the number of images reported for each passage and the text  dependency and completeness of the images. Analysis of the responses revealed significant differences between good readers and both difference-poor and deficit-poor readers in number of images reported and text dependency of images; these differences favored the good readers. Differences between the difference-poor and deficit-poor readers were not significant for any of the variables, and there were no significant differences among the reader groups in completeness of images.

Although it was not possible to have subjects sort examples of all 24 relationships at one time, an attempt was made to have groups of subjects work with relationships that were likely to be confused with each other. The results support the validity of the distinction among the 24 logico-semantic relationships. The most important finding was the strong developmental trend that was found both in the increased congruence of the latent categories to the theoretical  categorization and in the increased sophistication of the grouping strategies employed by the subjects over age levels. The findings also suggested that greater changes occurred between the fifth and eighth grades than between the eighth and eleventh grades. Future research should explore the development of flexibility in children's word definition abilities. (FL)",

        "description":"To ascertain whether subjects spanning the range of reading acquisition exhibit semantic constructivity when confronted with a silent reading task, a study was conducted involving 120 second, fifth, and seventh graders, and 30 graduate students. For purposes of the study, semantic constructivity was defined as the uncued production of inferences based on one's knowledge of spatial relationships and reflecting semantic descriptions located in separate statements in a text. The subjects were tested using an &quot;acquisition/false recognition&quot; paradigm comparing their recognition memory for sentences with identical deep structure but which differed in the semantic descriptions suggested. The primary result was the strong tendency for all subjects to &quot;recognize&quot; the semantically  congruent inferences present in the recognition task as having been present in the original acquisition situation. The findings support the psycholinguistic studies of miscues in oral reading which characterize reading as a constructive rather than an interpretive process. These findings imply that further research should be toward a reconsideration of theories and questions of readability. Additional research might consider the type of constructive activity that readers of differing ages exhibit. However, the strongest implication is support for the reemphasis of reading as a language-based process. (Author/FL)",

The statements are accompanied by several activities designed to help students understand and become familiar with them. In a culminating activity, it is suggested that students keep logs in which they detail the kinds of materials they have read, their purpose in reading each item, and their reactions to the material.

Treating language as a set of functional components to be learned and applied in appropriate situations (such as using language to promise, to be invited, or to infer correct answers on tests from context clues) has just begun, but the initial research is encouraging. Moreover, knowledge of language functions may be of special value to reading teachers rather than to students learning to read, since teachers could concentrate on  observing students' effective language usage rather than having students imitate artificial standards of \"correct\" intonation and grammar. Although the study of language functions would only be one part of a general reading program, continued research into this area of reading instruction should improve reading teacher effectiveness.

        "description":"To determine if auditory sequential memory (ASM) in young children can be improved through training and to discover the effects of such training on the reading scores of children with reading problems, a study was conducted involving 92 second and third graders. For purposes of this study, auditory sequential memory was defined as the ability to retain auditorily presented information in proper sequence for the purposes of immediate action or recall. The students were assigned to one of four groups: a group receiving training in ASM, a group receiving training for sustained attention to task, a cognitive enrichment group, and a control group which received no treatment intervention. The children were asked to follow oral directions to complete a series of tasks. The directions  varied according to the function of the group. The findings indicate that specific training for ASM resulted in improved ASM and that training for attention had a similar effect. Training for attention, however, did not result in reading improvement nor did the control group improve. Reading accuracy scores of the ASM group were higher than those of the other groups, but not significantly higher than those of the cognitive enrichment group. Reading comprehension was not affected differentially by the treatments. (FL)",

After 25 weeks of instruction consisting of 20-minute sessions twice each week, no significant differences were found in vocabulary or comprehension among the four groups. Certain problems encountered during the study, including the difficulty of finding appropriate reading materials and the lack of control of teacher effectiveness variables, may have led to the lack of significant findings.  Among the strategies that teachers can use for teaching and for future research are to have students work together on cloze exercises, to develop strategies for less able students, and to work initially with materials using the students' own language patterns. Although this study showed no significant findings, the cloze procedure does have potential as a teaching technique. (GW)",

Based on these conversation elements, a process model is outlined that requires a conversant to respond appropriately to preceding utterances, and to  integrate a speaker's utterance with preceding utterances. Appendixes include state assignment rules for a context space, semantic relational rules determined by the underlying structure of a conversation, and a focus level algorithm for the constituents of a given context space (the actors, objects, events, issues, location, time, and duration period).

Twenty-five color slides covering a wide range of topics were used to assess interest. The reading comprehension phase of the experiment involved the use of a set of encyclopedia passages, half of which corresponded to the child's least preferred topics. Results indicated that black children comprehended more of high- than low-interest material. White children's performance was similarly influenced by the interest level of  material; the gap between white and black children's performance was not reduced under the high-interest condition. Analysis of children's topic preferences indicated considerable cross-race similarity of interests, a finding which cautions against overestimating the uniqueness of black children's interests when selecting reading material for them.

        "description":"Glass and Holyoak (1975) have raised two issues related to the distinction between set-theoretic and network theories of semantic memory, contending that: (a) their version of a network theory, the Marker Search model, is conceptually and empirically superior to the Feature Comparison model version of a set-theoretic theory; and (b) the contrast between set-theoretic and network theories parallels distinctions in formal semantics that are concerned with analyticity and binary truth values. This paper takes issue with both of these claims, first arguing that the set-theoretic vs. network distinction is orthogonal to issues like analyticity and binary truth. The Marker Search and Feature Comparison models are then considered in detail. Objections are raised to some of the  theoretical mechanisms postulated in the Marker Search model, and Glass and Holyoak's criticisms of the Feature Comparison model are discussed. Finally, new experimental results that undermine the critical empirical base for the Marker Search model are presented. (Author/TJ)",

From decoding speed measures and comprehension measures, the performance of the trained poor readers was compared to both their performance on an equivalent untrained passage and to the performance of good readers. The second experiment repeated the first, with the addition of a training condition which emphasized rapid phrase reading.

In response to this problem, the Educational Testing Services (ETS) offers educators a holistic approach to scoring the essay portions of standardized tests. This scoring method, based on the belief that the overall impression in a written passage is more important than any other single grammatical aspect, requires that each essay be evaluated on a simple scale by two or three readers, making it possible for major college-level testing  programs to reintroduce a writing sample. Other services offered by ETS include teaching educators to use holistic scoring, devising test exercises to assess the writing abilities of French and English speaking students in Canada, constructing multiple choice writing assessments, preparing high school and college-level skills tests, and forming a writing center that responds to the requests for assistance that fall out of the range of existing ETS programs.

Data were gathered on the respondent's educational and income level, the number of children living at home, the number of televisions in the household, and what members of the household made the viewing decisions. Results indicate that the model predicted successfully the level of exposure to PTV content among respondents who made their own decisions concerning what programs to watch, but that the  level of exposure was unrelated to the discrepancy measure among those who let others make the viewing decision. When each of eleven gratification items was considered separately, the model discriminated between viewers and nonviewers of PTV on eight of the items.

Cultural analysis provides insight into the struggles of the social order which are behind current regulatory battles, public criticism, and practitioners' struggles which are based on the content of advertising (cultural values); it offers a useful perspective for discussing such current issues in advertising as professionalism and self-regulation; and it offers a way to discuss \"social responsibility\" in the light  of the relationship between advertising and culture. Without a commitment to long-range scholarship, historical knowledge, sociological sensitivity, and \"sociological imagination,\" however, cultural analysis can result in near-sighted intellectual vision merely affirming fashionable cultural values.

        "description":"The question of whether publishers' news preferences affect the performances of editors and reporters is examined in this paper. The first section reviews studies of ways the newsroom environment has affected reporters' role assumptions; it then notes that previous studies have generally been monadic (focusing on only one person) and have provided little insight into role interactions in the newsroom. The second section shows how the coorientation model of communication was used in a dyadic study in twelve Indiana newsrooms, in which the following coorientation relationships were investigated: agreement between reporters' and editors' news selections; congruency between reporters' selections and their perceptions of how their superiors would select the news; and accuracy of  reporters' perceptions of their superiors' news selections. Among the findings presented in the paper were that reporters and editors seem to operate independently of each other, that reporters pay more attention to their own convictions than to those of their editors and publishers, and that the news play of editors and publishers is very similar.

        "author":["Reid, Leonard N."],
        "description":"In response to public concern over the effects of television commercials on children, the Federal Trade Commission formulated regulatory proposals that would ban certain advertising from children's television and regulate advertising intended for the eight year old to the eleven year old age group. However, in the light of two recent research studies, it is important to reassess the tendency of parents to relegate, and for regulatory bodies to assume, parental responsibilities for the consumer socialization of children. The first study indicated that mother-child interaction does influence the child's development of such consumer-related skills as product awareness, comparison, and evaluation. Based on Piaget's theory of cognitive development, the second study revealed that  preschool children possess a sophisticated ability to understand the nature and purpose of television commercials and are able to discern commercial content from program content. Based on this research, efforts to increase parental involvement in the consumer socialization of their children provide a more realistic and potentially more effective solution for regulating children's television viewing than control through regulatory agencies.

        "description":"In an attempt to understand nonreader attitudes toward the daily newspaper, 576 non-newspaper reading adults were queried in three waves about their reasons for avoiding newspapers. In the first wave, the major findings were that nonreaders avoid newspapers because of lack of time, preference for another news medium, newspaper cost, and lack of interest. In the second wave, typical nonreaders (those low in income and education, the young and the elderly) and atypical nonreaders (those high in income and education, and the middle-aged) were queried about a checklist of 15 avoidances developed from the first wave of interviews. Responses to the checklist were factor analyzed and reduced to five significant reasons nonreaders avoid newspapers: newspaper content, poor eyesight, lack  of time, use of other media, and perceived newspaper bias. It was found that typical nonreaders avoid newspapers because of poor eyesight, while atypical nonreaders do not read because of lack of time and newspaper content. In the third wave, nonreaders were defined as those avoiding both daily and weekly newspapers. Four major factors were found to cause this group's avoidance of newspapers: perceived newspaper bias, avoidance of print, use of broadcast media, and lack of time. (Author/GW)",

        "description":"Many states have adopted minimal competency testing in reading or writing, assuming that goals of basic education are measurable and that testing for such goals is technologically feasible. It is not clear that such testing comes at a time in history when the quality of education is demonstrably lower than at other times in American education. The competency tests themselves may or may not reflect the ability to use skills in the real world. The evaluation of writing tests especially is open to question when that testing does not require writing and when the results, even when writing is required, are quite mixed. Where there is evidence that the quality of writing has declined, there is indication that basic skills have not declined but that complex skills need attention. A  group called together by the College of Education at the University of Illinois in 1977 produced guidelines which suggest what skills should be considered minimum; they also suggest ways of testing for such skills. The cost of producing and scoring tests which follow these suggestions would be high but if students and teachers are going to be evaluated, it should be done in terms of a comprehensive experience with language and not a focus on a narrow band of skills.

After receiving project instructions, students suggest possible clients, and team assignments are made. Work on the projects takes place outside of class except for team progress meetings with the instructor. Part one of each team's project, written in term paper style, sets forth a statement of the problem, information about the organization under study and similar organizations, and a definition of the organization's publics. For part two, students write about long-range objectives, goals, and strategies of  their public relations plans and make in-class presentations to which they invite representatives of their organizations. The advantages of the approach--which far outweigh the problems that arise--include its ability to bring relevance to classroom material, and aid community organizations, teach resourcefulness and interpersonal skills, and provide students with a great sense of accomplishment.

        "description":"Teaching composition as involving merely syntax and paragraph structure has no clear relation to an education in the liberal arts or to significant growth in understanding. Work in mechanics needs to be subordinated to the communicative and logological (how words act rather than their content) functions of language. One hopeful approach to teaching composition is expressed by Kenneth Burke in &quot;A Grammar of Motives,&quot; where he calls for writers to work not only with a grammar of syntax but also with a grammar of motives. He gives the composition theorist a way of anchoring all levels of the writing process in a dialectical process in which powers of manipulation become powers of understanding. Burke uses the writing of William James to illustrate what he means: language is a map of  the mind because language does not merely refer to the world, it creates one. In adopting a logological attitude, the writer finds that language is infused with action and there is a dramatic interplay between thinker and ideas: the thinker is exhorted while ideas produce, enable, possess, admonish, and suspend. The kind of verbal world that is alive to the drama of word choice is much more open to discovery, insight, and learning than is the world of language as mechanics. (TJ)",

        "description":"Coverage of Chicanos by the news media, almost nonexistent until the mid-1960s, still has not achieved full balance or objectivity. It is important for media personnel to develop greater competence in handling Chicano coverage since the Latino group, of which Chicanos are the largest segment, are the nation's fastest growing population group and--contrary to their portrayal by the media as a regional group--are dispersed throughout the United States. Research studies on media coverage of Chicanos have shown that coverage, generally low, has been concentrated in periods when Chicanos are either the subject of public issues or perceived as posing a threat to the established order; that stereotypical symbols, often with negative connotations, have been used to designate Chicano  groups; that reporters covering Chicanos tend to rely on non-Chicano sources; and that coverage of Chicanos has tended to emphasize negative aspects of the community. A study of 1977-1978 California newspaper coverage of undocumented Chicano workers, or \"illegal aliens,\" shows that reporters relied heavily on Anglo law enforcement and public officials as sources, rather than on representatives of immigrant organizations, legal agencies, Latino groups, and the academic community, and consequently portrayed the undocumented workers as law enforcement or public problems.

Based on research studies that indicate the dependence of the writing process on the decision making process in areas such as coherence, order, and intended audience, this approach could affect student motivation positively because it implies an explicit statement of the tasks to be accomplished and presents standards for determining success. While areas of linguistics (tagmemics and transformational grammar) and composition theory contribute to the understanding of the writing process, they do not offer workable criteria for making decisions and  cannot be used in establishing a comprehensive generative stylistics. After research has defined how forms and patterns of language affect the reader and how the reader responds to elements of varying relevance, a fixed set of standards can be established that offers fixed patterns of expected and unexpected arrangement in written discourse which will elicit predictable audience responses. These standards would also provide focusing techniques for measuring writing and guiding revision. (MAI)",

A  study is then described in which subjects were asked to select male, female, or male and female referents for statements containing so-called sex-neutral terms; preliminary findings indicate that the concept of a consistently sex-neutral or inclusive term in English is not supportable, despite claims to the contrary, and that the term \"man\" in particular emerges as a sex-marked male referent rather than a neutral term.

The specific independent and perceptual variables examined were: believability, liking the story and program, story function, age, story context, and age/context interaction. The children were assigned to one of two viewing conditions and shown a ten-minute videotape in which the story context had been manipulated. In the first condition a news story was presented surrounded by cartoon segments and commercials, while in the second condition the story was embedded in a regular news show. Following the tape, the students completed a brief multiple  choice quiz about the news story. The results showed that the variables accounted for a significant portion of the variance in learning while the manipulation of the story context had no independent effect on learning beyond that accounted for by the perceptual variables. Age, however, had a very strong effect on learning through the variables of story function and liking the program. An analysis of the age/context interaction indicated that while younger children learned more from the story embedded in the newscast, older children learned more from the story in the cartoon context.

Furthermore, the pressure to publish or perish presents problems, especially in regard to research, for these teachers are not likely to have the tools or the background to formulate and carry out research projects in composition when their training is in literature. The administrator's task is to ensure adequate time for teaching (including small classes, time for grading, and time for special assistance to students) as well as to  help reeducate both composition teachers to be able to carry out research and departmental faculty, who neither respect nor support composition research and teaching.

        "description":"In a two-stage procedure to discover how children use television commercials in family group viewing situations, researchers first conducted thirty family interviews with as many family members present as possible; then they selected nine children's families for extended (three month) participant observation to study the formative aspects of each child's interaction with television commercial content. The collected observation data supported the view that children are capable of knowingly interpreting and using commercials to change the character of viewing situations by involving others in planned social interaction. These interactions include (1) using commercials to draw others into conversations and activities (whether related or unrelated to message content), (2) seeking  information from parents or siblings to resolve ambiguous or complex message presentations, and (3) using commercials to avoid the demands and requests of others, especially parents. The observed interactions indicate that television and its content are social objects used by the child to manipulate viewing situations and social actions. In effect, the child is not a passive observer of television, but an active viewer. (RL)",

Each essay describes a specific successful classroom strategy for involving students in doing English rather than in simply absorbing it. While the approaches are diverse, several concepts appear frequently, such as asking students to examine attitudes and feelings, having students produce their own work, giving them problems to solve, creating task-oriented small groups, conducting role-playing and dramatic activities, allowing students to make decisions about classroom activities, sending students into the community, encouraging student-to-student interactions, providing opportunities for students to help each other, creating educational games, and organizing discussions  with student leadership. Of these strategies, the one most frequently used is interaction between persons. The essays, divided into four sections, focus on getting students involved in reading, composing, poetry, and research. (TJ)",

        "description":"A basic writing course designed for college freshmen who do not score high enough on entrance examinations to qualify for regular composition courses emphasizes the positive aspects of a student's writing. The nongraded course consists of four components: journal writing, grammar instruction, in-class paragraph writing, and controlled composition. The journals are used to establish rapport between students and the instructor; instead of grading the entries, the instructor writes comments about their content. Grammar instruction involves a mastery learner method. A test is administered after each unit; if a student achieves a certain level, the unit is considered completed and the next one is begun. Students who do not achieve mastery must review the material with the instructor  and be retested. The weekly paragraphs are reviewed in tutorial conferences where the students read their works aloud and the instructor comments on them. If corrections are needed, the instructor asks for a rewrite. In the controlled composition component of the course the students copy a model composition or rewrite it according to instructions. This exercise provides students with practice in the forms that give them the most trouble and also teaches proofreading. Through these techniques the course eliminates the negatives of grading and failure and presents the possibility of error-free writing. (FL)",

The paper first notes problems in recent research on sex differences in communication, presents the research questions guiding the study, and discusses the following topics examined in the study: three aspects of dominance (control, certainty, and superiority/high status behaviors), three aspects of submissiveness (deference, indecision and insecurity, and approval-seeking), and relationships between communication and androgyny. It then describes the procedures, methods of data analysis, and operational definitions of cues used in the study and reports  and discusses results related to each of the topics examined. Two general conclusions were drawn from the results: (1) male and female subjects did not conform unilaterally to stereotypic gender-based behaviors with regard to either dominance or submission, and (2) psychological sex and task differences significantly affected patterns of nonverbal behavior on half of the dependent measures.

The study revealed that there is a consistent pattern in the nature of interpersonal courses. Generally, they are 100-level courses, taught independently by regular full-time staff members, and offered for three credit hours with five sections of the course offered each semester, each section with from 23 to 30 students. The course philosophy is predominantly humanistic-behavioristic with instructors devoting a majority of class time directly to interpersonal communication. Little overall time is given to intrapersonal and small group communication,  communication theory, and public speaking. The survey indicated that most instructors approach a balance between theory and performance. This balance is reflected in the use of both written examinations and class participation as methods for determining student grades, which are generally determined by the instructor, not by the students. The investigation supports the idea that although interpersonal communication courses are new, they appear to have gained a strong foothold in college and university speech curricula.

Format choices were then analyzed according to the demographic variables sex, age, marital status, education, geographic stability, dwelling type, and residence ownership. Results indicated that persuaders and  informers who use radio can use demographic distinctness to select an appropriate format for the target audience and stations with distinct audiences can predict that their programing is reaching a selected subgroup, that many subjects who named a top forty station as their favorite were past their teenage years, that nearly half of those with a four year college education indicated a preference for beautiful music and news, and that listeners of rock stations were more likely to call the station.

        "description":"Traditionally, studies of educational innovations have based evaluations on accomplishment of officially-stated ends. This study, however, explores alternative theoretical frameworks for evaluation. Project Redesign took place in an upper-middle-class suburb with the pseudonym \"Meadow City.\" The project was funded by the National Institute of Education as an attempt to redesign the educational system to meet changing societal needs. It was a large-scale participatory planning project involving scores of parents, teachers, and administrators. Evaluating the project using a \"rational evaluation model\" calls for judging the quality of the decisions and outcomes of the project. Judged in this light, the project was not a success. However, another evaluation model, the \"organized  anarchy model,\" is based on the assumption that planning is desirable in itself as an opportunity for organizational members to learn things, feel important, come together, and highlight important issues. Judged from this viewpoint, the project was valuable to the school district. Yet another evaluation model, the \"symbolic interaction model,\" views planning as a renegotiation of the unwritten contract between the school system and its community. Viewed in this way, the project, merely by bringing together so many people to present their views on the meaning of education, was of significant value. (Author/JM)",

Experience designing and managing an administrators' development program suggested that muddling through can be a virtue. Several characteristics of &quot;muddling through,&quot; as defined by Lindblom, were present in the program. The process of choosing policies was intertwined with the process of choosing values. Program goals changed as the program progressed. The criterion for good policy was everyone agreeing on it. Policy was constantly made and remade. Timing of policy decisions depended on circumstances rather than a set  schedule. Muddling through was used intentionally as a normative strategy in this program for three reasons: adult learning is most productive when the learner participates in the design of the learning program; program managers wanted to take advantage of &quot;opportunism&quot; or the use of the environment as a resource for program development; and the success of the program was dependent on an ongoing accommodation between the sponsors of the program and the school systems that participated in it. A new challenge for administrative science is to help administrators muddle through better. (Author/JM)",

Private schools provide a unique laboratory for educational research. They also give clients more control over their lives, strengthen cultural diversity, and provide an opportunity for parents to choose educational methods that suit their children's needs. It has been charged that private schools may endanger national unity, limit children's life choices, hamper efforts to promote equal educational opportunity and racial justice, and destroy economies of scale. On examination, however, many of these charges appear to lack force. First, the effects of schooling appear to be too weak for any school to destroy national unity. There is also little evidence that  public schools are more successful at presenting a neutral autonomy-promoting program than are private schools. Studies show too that private schools often serve to promote racial desegregation or better educational opportunities for disadvantaged students. Even the economies of scale argument has been weakened by current evidence. In light of these considerations, state regulation of private schools must not aim for undue standardization but rather must encourage the pursuit of pluralistic goals and diverse approaches to the achievement of these goals.

        "description":"The conventional concept of educational efficiency, adapted from the technical-industrial sector, is inappropriate for public schools. In the technical industrial sector, there is widespread agreement about the desired outcome: profit. Yet there is very little public agreement about the proper goals of schooling. Even if agreement on goals could be achieved, techniques for measuring school outcomes are primitive and imprecise. There is also little agreement about what is the best educational process. Finally, it is difficult to measure school efficiency since the influence of outside environmental and socioeconomic factors on achievement is so significant. It would be more useful to substitute \"institutional responsiveness\" as the measure of educational efficiency. This goal  could then be pursued through greater practical reliance on political processes and the market mechanism, such as in an educational voucher system. In the face of so many unknown factors about educational efficiency, it might be best to allow educational consumers to choose schools that embody their own definitions of efficiency and concentrate on their own preferred educational goals. As a complement to such a system, new personnel incentives would also enhance school efficiency. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Although efficiency in education has been a long-standing concern, school districts are not rationally or scientifically managed or run in a businesslike manner. Yet this lack of efficiency may not be the result of poor management by school district administrators. School district managers are forced to respond quickly to an ever-changing melange of requirements and programs, have virtually no real authority to make basic personnel decisions, and have no incentives for acting efficiently. For instance, districts are often required to discharge or promote personnel without reference to merit criteria. Administrator promotions are sometimes based on certification rather than qualities or contributions. Teachers are often forced to allocate instructional time to noninstructional  activities like test administration and filling out forms. Finally, seniority rights and state-level retirement systems often force school districts to retain expensive staff. Thus, the cause of school district inefficiency may be found in state agencies that legislate what districts are to do. There will be little improvement in school district efficiency until state officials give district-level administrators significant discretionary authority. The greatest potential for improvement in public education today may be found at the state level. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"A number of important issues must be addressed during the process of graduation competency identification. Each school system must determine what it means by the term competency before identifying a set of graduation requirements. Graduation competencies may emphasize school subject skills, basic skills, or skills needed in everyday life. Life role-focused competencies may require the schools to significantly change their instructional, management, and measurement procedures. To determine the areas to be included in a set of competencies a school system can tap public opinion, consult other competency frameworks, and analyze skills needed in adult life roles. When competencies are broad, their number is reduced and they become more flexible and easier to report. When they are  specific, they lead to more focused instruction and are easier to measure. A single set of graduation competencies for all students seems logical, but individualized instruction and measurement must be provided. Broad community involvement in drafting competencies has political advantages and assures better coverage, but it has the potential for divisiveness and unrealistic expectations. A consistent format for stating graduation competencies can facilitate clarity and ease of instruction, measurement, and reporting. Seventy-seven examples of graduation competencies are provided in the second section. These competency statements focus on the application of school skills in everyday life. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Since 1975, Ontario teacher negotiators have focused attention on conditions-of-employment clauses. This paper focuses on those clauses that have direct or indirect cost implications for school boards as enrollments decline. These clauses concern such issues as pupil-teacher ratios, class size, and job protection. Information for the analysis was gathered through interviews with Toronto teachers, board members, and administrators as well as from statistical data from the Education Relations Commission. The paper examines changes in the incidence and content of conditions-of-employment clauses since 1975. The rising incidence of conditions-of-employment clauses suggests that teacher negotiators are making substantial gains, with secondary teachers making the most gains, elementary  teachers second, and private school teachers third. However, the content of these clauses shows that boards have maintained a high degree of flexibility in determining staffing needs and that the cost increases for boards have been fairly small. In the future, it appears there will be continued pressure for clauses directly related to declining enrollments and staffing flexibility, but real gains will be modest in size and slow in coming.

Analysis of research shows emphasis on the basic rights of impaired, disabled and handicapped individuals to participate in creative arts activities as their interests presuppose them, and an end to the proliferation of program aids which provide specific program activities rather than an emphasis on program aids adapted for the general population. The major portion of the guide  contains an alphabetical bibliography (often containing annotations) of over 1000 printed references organized into the following sub categories: creative arts, general sources; art, art therapy, arts and crafts; dance, movement, and dance therapy; drama, psychodrama, puppetry; music and music therapy; and poetry, bibliotherapy, creative writing, photography. References are indexed by both program area and handicapped condition. Thirty nine aids, a representative sample of cassettes, records, films, videotapes and other audiovisual materials are listed alphabetically by record or film, tape, or multimedia category.

        "description":"The idea of reducing the redundancy of a verbal message in a statistical way is presented as a practiced technique of language testing. Considering the temporality of speech comprehension, and the necessarily sequential intake of information, these cues may include the serial order of elements and transitional probability. To give the background of reduced redundancy tests, the contructivist view of listening comprehension is outlined as a creative, active cognitive operation with several implications: (1) it means that processing is facilitated by the linguistic and pragmatic organization of the message, together with its presentation in context; (2) it implies that memory, especially short-term storage, is an essential part of comprehension; and (3) it implies that the native  listener is only partly bound by the properties of the signals he receives. Two reduced redundancy techniques of listening comprehension testing are reviewed that present the learner with messages that do not contain all the information they normally carry. In the noise test and the aural cloze test, the learner needs to mobilize his total awareness of the linguistic and pragmatic structure. Preliminary observations on an experimental test of aural cloze with Finnish learners imply that the tests have instructional value and may have a stronger theoretical basis than the completion tasks traditionally used to measure listening for details.

The program fits into existing rules for the M.A. in literature and was based on existing courses. The rules remain flexible enough for the student to concentrate on either historical or applied linguistics. Students adopting this option must take five of the eight courses in language and linguistics, write a thesis on a linguistic topic, and pass an oral exam on a reading list. The written description of the program given to all incoming graduate students and the reading list are attached as appendices. It is hoped that  this report will serve as a model for other institutions wishing to diversify their options. (Author/AMH)",

This article reviews the relationship among counselors, students, and language instructors, describes their common goals, with emphasis on career guidance in its broadest definition, and enumerates practical steps to foster communication between counselors and teachers. A review of the purposes of career guidance programs already established in many states reveals a parallel rationale for foreign language study, including understanding of self and others, values clarification, problem-solving and decision-making, data-gathering and use, and personal planning. It is concluded that language teachers should develop programs  that integrate their discipline into the total education program and reflect local, state, and national goals. It is the language teachers' responsibility to improve their relationship with counselors so as to gain their support and serve as a team in future programs. (NCR)",

        "description":"An immersion program in a public elementary school in Montgomery County, Maryland, uses French as the medium of instruction in academic subjects. The program is based on the theory that language is learned best when there is a need to understand and communicate in that language. All students are eligible for enrollment in the multi-age classes. The Montgomery County curriculum is followed, using French materials. The major aims of the program are for the children to master their school subjects and to acquire substantive fluency in French. Standardized test results show the immersion students to be comparable in ability and achievement to their peers in English-speaking American classes and in French immersion classes in Canada. Immersion in general requires a great deal of  planning and extra effort on the part of the teachers. Parents, other adults, and high school students work in the classroom to assist the teachers and to learn French. The program's only added cost to the school system is for foreign language materials.

While Jamaican Creole is undergoing a process of decreolization (i.e. the speech community has reached a post-creole status, in De Camp's terminology), Limon Creole exists in the context of a prestige language, Spanish, the national language of Costa Rica, which is not related to Limon Creole. Although English remains as the standard of the acrolect variety, Spanish, as the official language effectively reinforced by the government of the country, affects the creole, particularly the basilect-mesolect variety. The specific aim of this discussion is to suggest some ways in which Costa Rican Spanish exerts influence on the lexicon,  semantic range, and syntactic structures of Limon Creole. Since &quot;native&quot; white socio-cultural pressures are such that immediate acculturation of the Negro Limon Creole minority to the Spanish majority is politically desirable, the government has not made any efforts to foster bilingual education. Thus, while Limon Creole is now interspersed with Spanish loans, a prediction can be made as to how this on-going process might affect the future of this unstable bilingual situation. (Author/NCR)",

Rationale and procedures of the study are outlined, and then the analyses of four-year and two-year institutions' language programs are discussed in terms of: (1) findings of the questionnaire study (including analysis of responding sample, enrollment summaries, staffing, the foreign language requirement); (2) major problems (including change in degree  requirements and change in student attitude and ability in four-year institutions; restricted offerings and curriculum emphasis on \"practical\" education in two-year institutions); and (3) factors influencing enrollment growth (including instructional quality and career related courses). A description of selected programs in four-year institutions is also included. Recognizing the problem area is relatively easy while solutions to problems must be found with the combined efforts of each individual department, and each local, state, regional, and national organization concerned with foreign language instruction.

In addition, it was found that biographical and background variables also identified in the study may be related to success and failure in such programs. This report discusses the first phase of a three-year follow-up investigation whose purpose is to identify a set of variables predictive of success or failure in primary French immersion programs. The subjects of the study were 1,000 four-year-olds in 77 kindergartens. Biographical and background information and teacher ratings  were obtained for all. Two hundred children who would be enrolled in French immersion classes were also given the Early Identification Assessment Battery (EIAB). Results indicated describable patterns of differences in terms of family characteristics, preschool experience, parental attitudes and educational goals. The validity of the informal criteria used by teachers to recommend French immersion or the English program will also be assessed in the longitudinal study. The predictive validity of data from the EIAB as well as the personal data and teacher ratings will be assessed against criterion measures of achievement in French and English to be obtained in the Spring of 1978 and 1979.

Responses from the 83 male and l9 female participants surveyed indicate that the backgrounds of women in graduate administration are more similar to those of men than different. Their patterns of career advancement also appear to  be similar but women are more likely to be in acting or interim positions. The trend is toward more women in graduate administration. Both sexes report similar contact patterns with colleagues, which indicates that women are not excluded from opportunities for informal decision-making. The psychic rewards derived from the job appear to differ for women and men, with men reporting more satisfaction from contacts with and service to faculty and students while women found leadership opportunities most rewarding.

The weighted results of the survey showed  that over 76,000 nonimmigrants from developing countries were enrolled either full-time or part-time in the three fields. Approximately 56,000 (74 percent of the total) were enrolled in science and engineering fields, 13,300 (17 percent) were in business and management, and 6,500 (9 percent) were in health fields. The majority of these foreign students (52 percent) were enrolled at the graduate level in almost 200 institutions, 45 percent were undergraduates, and 3 percent had postdoctoral appointments. U.S. support was more common at the more advanced levels of study. Comparisons of the study findings are made with a report issued by the Institute of International Education.

An agenda is proposed for the review and an estimate is provided of the number of students who are qualified for postsecondary education but who fail to receive it because they lack the funds. It is proposed that the government spend up to two billion dollars more annually on postsecondary student aid after a three-year phasing-in period. Increased governmental spending of 25 percent would mean that in the near future annually about 67 percent of high school graduates would go on to postsecondary education soon after high school, compared with about 60 percent today. Groups of U.S. high school graduates in selected years from 1964 to  the present are described and projections are made through 1984. Estimates are made of how many high school graduates of different abilities and family incomes go on to postsecondary education and how many do not. Results of a 1977 survey by the College Board of a sample of guidance counselors in public, parochial, and independent high schools concerning student educational and career plans are analyzed. Issues pertaining to employment and educational opportunity are examined, and arguments for investing more public funds in higher education are presented.

        "description":"The relationship between salary increases and student ratings of teaching effectiveness was studied using a sample of 266 faculty members at Kansas State University. Three measures of teaching effectiveness (student progress in meeting relevant course objectives, liking the instructor, and appreciation of the field of study) and two salary criteria (percent and dollar increase) were used. Several measures of the emphasis on the teaching function were used to determine whether this variable moderated the relationship between salaries and student ratings. The effect of discipline was also examined. In general, there was a modest but significant correlation between ratings of teaching effectiveness and percent salary increase. The amount of emphasis given to the teaching function  was a significant determinant of the strength of this relationship. Correlations were generally more pronounced in social science and humanities than in the sciences. Student motivation was highly correlated with effectiveness ratings, but was not regularly taken into account in salary recommendations. (Author/LBH)",

Results indicate that, by observing the variation of this distance measure as keywords are extracted sequentially from a document, the occurrence of noisy keywords may be detected. This property of the distance measure has been utilized to design a sequential classification algorithm which works in two phases. In the first phase keywords extracted from a document are partitioned into two groups, the good keyword group and the noisy keyword group. In the second phase these two groups are analyzed separately to assign primary and secondary classes to a document. The algorithm has been applied to the SPIN data base, and very encouraging results  have been obtained. Appendices include descriptions and mathematical models of (1) Bayesian distance and classification error, (2) Bayesian distance and alpha-j values, (3) Bayesian distance and keyword vectors, and (4) the classification algorithm.

Museum activities are grouped in three categories: (1) initial--acquisition, accession, registration, identification, and restoration; (2) ongoing--research, exhibition, and conservation efforts; and (3) terminal--de-accessioning. The ongoing are the most important of the three types of activities. In order to carry out these activities efficiently, all the information required for each defined activity must be available at the right time and place; however, at the present time there are no systems of nomenclature that are generally accepted as a basis for defining and identifying  man-made artifacts. To meet this need, this project focused on the creation of a thesaurus for use at the Strong Museum. This standardized word list, or lexicon, includes words and phrases, and shows synonymous and hierarchical word relationships and dependencies. While it is not a panacea for all museum cataloging problems, it can serve as a common starting point in identification activities which are crucial to the cataloging process. A summary of the project, its rationale and processes, includes a description of the lexicon with examples. (MBR)",

Two major computer-related issues are addressed--the creation of new works with computer assistance, and use of copyrighted works in conjunction with computers. Three facets of the second issue are considered separately--placement into computers of copyrighted works, use of automated data bases, and copyright protection for the intellectual property in computer programs. In examining issues related to reprography the Commission focuses upon drawing a proper balance between the rights of copyright owners, and the general interests and needs of the public who rely upon photocopying as access to  copyrighted works; photocopying in libraries is a major concern in this area. Appendices include a summary of the mandate of CONTU; a complete discussion of each issue relating to use of copyrighted works; a summary of legislative history relating to both issues; and a bibliography which cites selected works on computers and copyright, photocopying and the Copyright Act, and articles written by the Commission staff.

Program objectives included allowing students to pursue a degree or continuing education program under circumstances convenient to them, researching and evaluating the independent study curriculum as compared with the regular traditional program, and producing not \"finished\" graduates but life-long learners. Six courses were offered in several time frames: late afternoon, evening, and Saturday. For each course, faculty members developed supplementary  enrichment materials, course outlines, modules, and study guides. Student evaluation consisted of refined pretests developed for each of the three types of classes, periodic tests and examinations, and post-tests. Findings indicate that the program was successful because all of the students increased their scores between the pre- and post-tests, self-paced students' performance was generally equal to that of students in the regular program, and they tended to have fewer incompletes. Recommendations and suggestions for future programs are included. (JPF)",

The application of the framework to an evaluation of the Educational Information System for Ontario (EISO) is described. Findings indicate that the strongest relationships are between process variables such as the number of citations printed and price; price and satisfaction; and between the amount learned and satisfaction. The negative relationship between price and satisfaction suggests that services which charge must be aware that clients are rating the service as well as the product. Future research is needed to discover  variables that determine the amount a client learns from a search, since this information would give the search analyst a better understanding of when and how a search should be conducted.

One of three planned studies of former occupational students (FY1978 program graduates, FY1979 occupational skill completers, and FY1979 and FY1980 program leavers), this graduate follow-up will be used by the community colleges to respond to federal and state inquiries regarding occupational programs, to compare local results with statewide norms, and as career planning data for current and potential students. Rather than the longitudinal design previously used in statewide follow-ups, the research method will be a one-time mail survey sent by each college to FY1978 occupational program graduates in  early 1979. The revised survey instrument contains standardized items intended to meet the needs of the colleges, the Board, the Division of Adult Vocational and Technical Education, the Veteran's Administration, and other federal agencies. It covers the following areas: student rating of college services, rating of college assistance in personal and job objectives, present educational and/or employment status, relation between job and college program, salary and location of place of employment, and comments regarding the impact of community college education. The primary responsibility for the study will be at the local level with the Illinois Community College Board providing central coordination and computerized data analysis. Appendices in the handbook include the format for  submission of student data on IBM E-3 cards, standarized items to be used in the survey, the format for coding responses, and a sample cover letter for the survey instrument.

Although Mexican-Americans constitute one-fifth of Texas' population, in fall 1976 they made up only 8.89% of total enrollment, 10% of undergraduate enrollment, and 4.75% of graduate enrollment in Texas senior colleges and universities. In public community/junior colleges, Chicano students comprised 16.75% of enrollments, a proportion close to their representation in the population; however, there is an apparent decline in the percentage of Chicanos (of total Chicano postsecondary enrollment) entering community/junior colleges,  from 75% in the early 1970's to 55%. National reports show Chicanos far behind other ethnic groups in graduation rates at all higher education levels. While such data are difficult to get for Texas, one followup study of Texas community/junior college graduates reported that only 8.7% of the respondents were Chicano. More is known about Chicano faculty due to a recent Texas study. From the findings one can say without hesitation that Chicanos are grossly underrepresented on the faculties and staffs of Texas institutions of higher education.

In 1976-77, total direct and indirect expenditures attributable to the 17 colleges in areas of salaries, purchase of materials, and capital building improvements were almost $124 million. In addition, the state received about $9 million from taxes paid by the faculty and staff, from the federal government, and from taxes on business property allocable to college transactions. About 6,700 jobs were also available because of the colleges. Human capital studies of the long-term impacts of the colleges on students and the state reveal that, on an average, community college students in Maryland will receive  almost a 27% return on their investments in higher education during their lifetimes. Social economic gains, in return for the costs of education to students and the public, were measured in terms of increased productivity; this average rate of return was about 15%.

The \"university orientation\" places an emphasis upon impersonal, intellectual, and purely academic objectives. The \"liberal arts orientation\" maintains that humanities instruction should contribute to the beliefs, values, expectations, attitudes, fears, emotions, and self-images of students. This latter orientation, which is currently strongly represented in the literature, tends to be pushing the humanities from its traditional place with specialized college programs into the realm of general education. One way to resolve these conflicting demands on community colleges is to develop a two-pronged curriculum with courses which serve the two interest groups of transfer students wishing to transfer  college credits directly to a four-year institution, and other students whose interests may lie in cultural enrichment. Extremes of relevance-seeking approaches that are academically unsophisticated, and courses with overwhelmingly rigorous standards are to be avoided. The humanities department chairperson should take a leadership role in promoting the right course of action in individual institutions. (A bibliography is included.) (MB)",

        "description":"This literature review focuses on the role of the community college in meeting the needs of adults seeking assistance in mid-life career changes. Factors such as longer life spans, better health, increased leisure time, and greater emphasis upon the quality of life increase the need for mid-life vocational counseling, leisure counseling programs, widow/widowers counseling, and pre-retirement workshops, as well as, the need for availability of lifelong educational opportunities. Family, job, and societal pressures can be seen to interact and produce four career patterns: routine (absence of career change), self-determined (career change because of desire rather than necessity), situationally determined (change brought about by outside pressures), and self-directed accommodation  (change influenced by environmental pressures but shaped by individual choice). An assessment of the career pattern involved is one of the first steps in finding a second career, and one in which community college counseling programs should play a part. The effective accomplishment of the educational and counseling goals of a college requires the provision of services that meet the special needs and abilities of adult students, the organization of services into a pattern that is compatible with the character of the college, and the administration of services in ways that are mutually supportive.

        "description":"This brief focuses on student attrition and retention in the two-year college. An introductory section discusses the definitions of attrition used in studies of student persistence; and how these definitions, which often include students who are actually completers in terms of their own educational goals, may exaggerate attrition rates, which are reported in the literature to range from 20.9% to 70.5%. Studies indicate that dropouts tend to be part-time students, vocational/technical or business majors, members of ethnic minorities, older students, women, and Protestants. Research studies have also addressed the reasons for attrition and tried to determine possible solutions to the problem. The remainder of the brief presents an annotated bibliography on attrition and retention  consisting of published and unpublished materials from the ERIC files divided into six sections: general works on and definition of attrition/retention; findings from the colleges; programs and methods of reducing attrition; special groups of students and attrition; withdrawal from courses; and methodology and use of follow-up studies.

        "description":"This study examines the effects of reading materials on children's gender stereotypes toward adult occupations. The study sample consisted of 355 first-, third- and fifth-grade middle class children randomized into 3 groups which received 10 stories each. One group received sex-role-reversed occupational stories, another sex-stereotyped stories, and the third stories unrelated to gender roles and occupations. Children's initial stereotypes were measured in a group-administered multiple-choice pretest. Post-treatment effects were measured by children's judgment of: (1) who (men or women) knows how or could learn how to do each of 20 identified male, female, and genderneutral occupations and (2) who ought to do them. Results show that (1) older children were more stereotyped than  younger ones about male jobs; (2) children's judgments about who ought to work at each occupation were more stereotyped than their judgments of who can work at the occupations; (3) judgments of who can do the work were less stereotyped when they were made after judgments of who ought to do the work; and (4) the role-reversed stories did not make a statistically significant difference in the children's attitudes. It is concluded that simply changing the names, pronouns and illustrations or adding occasional non-traditional classroom materials may not be powerful enough to change children's attitudes toward gender roles and occupations.

Two simultaneous approaches are used for data analysis: a cross sectional perspective using data collected from one time segment across different areas, and an historical approach for analysis of the development of policy and administrative change. Specific research methods comprise a review of Congressional intent, Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) regulations, state legislation, administrative performance, services with special references to urban/rural variations, and the Early Periodic  Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) program. Overall findings indicate that federal agencies interpret federal law diversely, and that states faced with uncertain policy, short funds, and external pressures fail to comply with even the federal EPSDT mandate. In addition, since HEW has failed to monitor its programs, states face no loss of funds or penalties. Recommendations include (1) that Congress provide sufficient funding to assure state cooperation and monitor state performance with continuous reporting systems; (2) that Congress be specific as to populations to be served and services to be provided; (3) that administrative agencies be consolidated to avoid interbureaucratic confusion; and (4) that child health advocacy groups become more involved in legislation and in  monitoring programs.

Principle 1 recommends that inservice educators focus on modifying a teacher's understandings (the constructions, concepts, or schemata relevant to his or her work) rather than on giving prescriptions for behavior. Principle 2 recommends strengthening enduring dispositions (e.g., inventiveness, patience, and enthusiasm) thought to be related to effective teaching. Principle 3 supports a focus on helping teachers to use competencies they already possess more reliably, consistently, appropriately, and confidently. Principle 4 suggests the importance of building long-term relationships with teachers instead of offering hasty corrections. Principle 5 proposes  that inservice educators maintain an optimum psychological distance from the teachers they work with. Principle 6 recommends the provision of moderate amounts of inspiration as well as encouragement and support to keep up the teacher's enthusiasm. (Author/CM)",

Eight general principles are listed: (1) legislative action should be based on accurate assessment of the current status of young children in Tennessee; (2) support should be given to children from nontraditional as well as traditional families; (3) policies should be designed to compliment rather than substitute for the child rearing responsibilities of families; (4) policies seeking to improve children's development should concentrate on the period from conception to school age; (5) parent and community participation should be mandated in publicly funded social service programs; (6) equal opportunity to benefit from services should be provided to  all children regardless of sex, ethnic, religious or cultural background; (7) policies should be designed so that they can be fairly and uniformly enforced; and (8) regular evaluation should be made of the impact of policies on children and their families.

A brief review of research on neonatal cognitive ability is followed by a description of the study itself. The subjects, 189 three-month-old Caucasian infants (61 first borns, 58 second borns, and 49 third borns) were given a battery of perceptual-cognitive tasks. These tasks included the Corman-Escalona Scales of Object Permanence, the Mental Development Index (MDI) of the Bayley Scales, and an attention task measuring habituation and dishabituation. An analysis of data failed to show any sex or social class differences, although the MDI was affected by birth order, with the first borns showing superior performance. In general, the  three measures of perceptual-cognitive ability were unrelated. These data are used to question the notion of a developmentally constant, unchanging, unitary construct of intelligence ('g' factor) in infancy, and therefore the usefulness of a test of infant intelligence.

All patients studied were about 8 years old. Sample I (84 pedodontic patients) underwent a variety of dental procedures (extractions, restorations, etc.) on the day of evaluation. Sample II (48 pedodontic patients) underwent a dental restoration. Subjects in both these samples were assessed while under treatment for a procedure they had undergone in the past. Sample III consisted of 49 inexperienced patients who were studied during their first dental restoration or extraction. Before treatment, the patient's fear of dentistry was rated by his mother and the dentist.  Children's self-reports of dental anxiety were also correlated with the data analysis. Results indicated only a slight relationship between behavioral and self-report measures of dental anxiety with the various predictor variables, and the child's behavior during treatment could not be predicted from any aspect of maternal anxiety. Findings suggest that the child's anxiety towards dental treatment is complexly determined, and that future research should include multiple measures of assessment. (Author/CM)",

Specific areas focused on in the report are: (1) assessment of the program implementation at each site; (2) analysis of the factors affecting implementation and identification of hypotheses relating levels of implementation with local or social characteristics; and (3) assessment of program costs. Chapter I presents an overview of the PDC evaluation and the purpose of Interim Report IV. Chapter II outlines the overall design of the Implementation Study and  includes a summary of data collection activities for the year 1976. Chapter III contains a description of the development of implementation assessment instruments. Results of a field test of data collection and analysis instruments conducted in Spring '76 are discussed and revisions are suggested. Chapter IV reports progress in identifying local factors, events or characteristics which shape or determine the levels of program implementation. A preliminary list of hypotheses based on the analysis of factors enhancing or retarding implementation is derived for evaluation in Year III. Chapter V presents the design and preliminary result of the cost analysis. Tables and charts are included. (Author/CM)",

        "description":"This study investigated the child rearing environments in 8 community based day care centers and 16 family day care homes and the social competencies of the toddlers enrolled in them. Subjects were forty 19-month-old toddlers from similar backgrounds, half in each type of day care. Socially directed behaviors between the toddler and peers, and between the toddler and adult were time sampled in the day care settings for 2 hours per child. The caregiver was interviewed regarding her training and other characteristics of her job. Results indicated that the two day care settings provided significantly different child rearing environments. The family day care homes cared for a smaller, more heterogeneous group; the caregivers were more isolated from other adults, did more housework  while caring for the child, and worked longer hours. In contrast, day care centers were designed specifically for children and had more large, nonportable play objects; the caregivers had more formal training but less experience as mothers than family day care workers. Social competency of the toddlers was examined through an analysis of 5 factors: positive social skills; dependent behaviors; high positive affect directed to the caregiver and high frequencies of imitating the adult; negative affect directed to the caregiver; and violation of adult standards. There were no differences between the 2 types of day care in the adult facilitative and responsive caretaking and in toddler affect and dependence, indicating that (1) both environments have the potential for promoting social  competency in toddlers and that (2) variation within day care settings may be more important than the type of day care.

The study was conducted to examine changes occurring as a result of the move towards comprehensive secondary education in Britain and as a result of the recommendations of the Plowden Committee for more individualized instruction at the primary level. In order to survey possible changes, classroom structure and teacher and student behaviors were observed in 60 junior classrooms. Although these observations indicated a change toward more flexible small group seating patterns, a concomitant change in the structure of the curriculum was not found. A traditional curriculum was still emphasized in most classrooms. In addition, the observations of the teachers indicated a high level of  interaction with certain children, rather than with the whole group, small groups, or with each child in the class. Many of the teacher-student interactions involved task supervision. Within-group teaching and pupil-pupil interactions were not emphasized. Although the more traditional schools in the present sample had the highest achievement levels, the paper emphasizes the importance of considering a variety of variables before interpreting this result. The results of the study suggest the need for a greater emphasis on the internal organization of the classrooms at the junior level. (BD)",

Many past federal rural development programs (lacking a federal rural policy focus) have failed to build adequate state and local capacity for managing rural development, to use a wide enough range of development tools, and to target resources on problems of special groups; fragmented programmatic approaches have caused rural data base deficiencies. Three objectives proposed for rural development are expanding economic opportunity, providing access to essential services and facilities, and strengthening public and private  institutions concerned with rural development. Strategies to increase effectiveness of federal rural development efforts might include: a comprehensive public report on status and needs of rural America and programmatic initiatives required; a more integrated rural development policy management process through a rural development policy focus within the White House, evolution in advocacy role of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and strengthened state and local institutional capacity; a larger role for private enterprise (national development bank, tax, wage, and output incentives); interagency efforts (housing, technical assistance, data base).

Women's labor force participation increased as agricultural employment declined and a sizeable growth in non-agricultural employment emerged; the pattern was consistent with the growth and direction of change in the Malaysian economy over the same period. About one third of women in each of three major ethnic communities (Malay, Chinese, and Indian) were employed, but they had rather distinctive patterns of type of work. Malay women tended to work in traditional agriculture, Indian women worked in modern agriculture, and  Chinese women had a more diversified structure, with over half working in the modern non-agricultural sector. Single women were generally found in the modern non-agricultural sector, while most other women worked in agriculture. Rural areas provided agricultural employment, both in the family and wage sectors. Women in larger towns and cities were predominantly found in the modern non-agricultural sector. Women with the least education tended to work in the agricultural sector and those with the most education were found in the modern non-agricultural sector. Higher education appeared to provide aspirations and credentials that enabled women to find modern sector employment that was largely independent of access to jobs (residence) or family obligations.

        "description":"A hearing was held to consider S.2997, a bill which would provide financial assistance for school construction to local educational agencies educating large numbers of immigrant children born in Mexico. In opening remarks, Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Texas, explained that 58,000 Mexicans immigrated to the US in 1977; towns along the American border, the area with the lowest per capita income in the US today, felt severe impacts from increased school enrollments. The bill would authorize $45 million for emergency assistance; to be eligible, a school district must have a minimum enrollment of 7 percent Mexican alien children, with at least 20 such children enrolled. The bill would allow $1,000 per child. Witnesses included Tom Anderson of the Texas Education Agency and three school  superintendents: Raul A. Besteiro, Jr., Brownsville, Texas; Gonzalo Garza, Eagle Pass, Texas; James K. Clark, Nogales, Arizona. Cris Aldrete of the Southwest Regional Border Commission also made a statement. Discussion centered around enrollment increases due to federal immigration policies (900 additional legal immigrant students yearly in Brownsville), tax bases, low per capita income, enrollment acceleration compared to national patterns, and responsibility for financing of school construction.

        "description":"Over 100 of the nation's 400 Indian tribes are overlooked in the administration of Indian trust responsibility. Senate Bill 2375 establishes administrative procedure to be followed by the Department of the Interior in acknowledging a federal relationship with certain Indian tribes. On April 18, 1978 testimony was conducted before the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs. The bill's value and desirability were acclaimed by those testifying, but objections were raised to certain components. The National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) expressed concern that massive and indiscriminate recognition of groups claiming to be tribes might result in the &quot;federal funding pie&quot; being sliced too thin among beneficiary groups. The NCAI submitted 12 principles for determining tribal  credentials which, if incorporated in the bill, would make it acceptable. Objection was also raised to the proposed creation of a new office in the Department of Interior to consider and process petitions for federal recognition; such an office might instead be established within the existing framework of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to avoid unnecessary duplication of personnel and to utilize expertise currently within the BIA. This document includes the bill itself, proceedings of the hearing, and informal and prepared statements of witnesses appearing. (DS)",

        "description":"Farming has undergone substantial changes in both economic and social structure in the past 40 years; these changes have affected the larger society with population changes in rural, nonmetropolitan areas. Seeking to explore the relationships between changes in farming and changes in place population for Michigan from 1930 to 1970, six variables were utilized as indicators of the changing structure of farming: farm land in crops, value of land and buildings per acre, average farm size, gross sales per farm, number of farm workers, and farm population. The commonly used dependent variable of change in the total population of nonmetropolitan counties was replaced with two variables measuring the population change of smaller places in all counties; longitudinally measured  independent variables were also used. Change in farm size was found to be strongly associated with the percent of places losing population; the greater the increase in farm size form 1930 to 1970, the greater the proportion of declining places. A relatively strong association existed between changes in farm size and farm population. As farms expanded and became less numerous, both farm workers and farm families were displaced from farms and the farm population. Conceptual, operational, and statistical modifications of the study suggested that farm changes have played a more important role in population changes in smaller places than that indicated in earlier analyses using different measures and units.

        "description":"Two-thirds of the 33,000 residents of Shawano County, Wisconsin, live in rural areas; agricultural interests comprise 30% of the employment economy. Inventories of Extension programs from 1960 to 1975 and telephone interviews with county and community leaders and a random sample of 1192 county residents yielded data for this survey. Most adults (76%) had contact with Extension, and a large majority of citizens and leaders judged it positively. Of the various approaches to implementing major programs, the mass media was the most effective at reaching more people. Individuals, groups and communities all benefitted from Extension's informational resources, facility development, and resource data on community concerns. Other conclusions were that Extension lacked sufficient identity  in the county and the community leaders wanted to be more involved in program determination and evaluation. Specific findings indicated ten general implications for Extension programming, including that Extension must: (1) determine the optimum balance between &quot;some&quot; contact with most people and &quot;intensive&quot; contact with fewer people; (2) decide on the extent of responsibility for assisting people who do not usually seek help; and (3) use strategic combinations of meetings, mass media, committee and individual contacts in sequential, continuous programming.

Most CHMSA's are located far from large population centers. Six hundred seventy three CHMSA's are found in approximately 700 U.S. counties; about a third of these are in the region that includes Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, the Carolinas, and Tennessee. Distances, population scarcity, low per capita income, racial discrimination, and communication and organization problems all act as barriers to access to health care. An area designated as a CHMSA may receive manpower assistance from the National Health Service Corp, which pays  medical personnel to serve two year terms in an area. Other Health, Education and Welfare programs serving such areas are Community Health Centers, Maternal and Child Health, Family Planning, Migrant Health, and Health Maintenance Organizations. The Rural Health Initiative program will act to coordinate within rural communities those projects funded by separate programs. CHMSA's will receive further assistance from the 200 Health Services Agencies across the U.S. who seek to determine area health needs, set goals, establish criteria for reaching them, and help communities begin implementation.

It uses the behavior recipient animals to detect whatever chemicals are synthesized in the brains of donor animals during learning. This document is a research report which attempts to delineate the limits to which the bioassay may profitably be extended by studying its behavioral specificity. In four experiments, it shows that the behavioral bioassay effect is stimulus specific, response specific, process specific, and task specific. Strong support is provided for the position that the information conveyed via brain  extracts is quite specific and not generally facilitating or depressing, as certain critics have argued. Results indicate the appropriateness of the method for the study of important learning and memory phenomena. A bibliography is provided for reference. (Author/GA)",

This class of pollution source includes powerplants, factories, refineries, municipal waste water treatment plants, etc., but excludes mobile sources such as trucks, and automobiles, and non-point sources such as some types of farms, mines, etc. Energy requirement estimates for water pollution control and for air pollution control are discussed separately. The discussion on water pollution control energy requirements includes: (1) Industrial Water Pollution Control; (2) Control of Thermal Pollution from Electric Power Plants; and (3) Municipal Wastewater Treatment. The air pollution control energy requirement  discussion deals with Industrial Air Pollution Control and with Control of SOx and Particulate Emissions from Electric Power Plants. Also included in this document is a comparison of pollution control-related energy estimates, a bibliography, and a summary. This study is a continuation of an earlier effort to estimate the energy required to meet pollution standards for stationary point sources. (Author/MR)",

The major cognitive, affective and educational influences are studied. Major social influences, including sex role stereotyping mathematics as a male domain, and perceived usefulness of mathematics for later life roles, are also discussed. Evidence related to hypotheses of biological sources as major influences of differences in mathematical achievement are investigated. The underlying theme of all three papers is the finding that sex differences in mathematics achievement, which are usually evident for the first time around grade 8 or 9, are largely a function of differential course taking  rather than any inability on the part of women to learn mathematics. Mathematics tests that do show sex differences usually do not control for the number of courses taken. Also, differences do not appear to have a biological basis. (Author/MP)",

The demand for teachers since 1970, including science teachers, has fallen drastically, and very few teachers have been hired because of declining enrollment and fiscal problems. Teacher turnover has been sharply reduced creating an aging, static teacher population. Since 1973 the output of high school teachers in academic subjects has dropped 43 percent. This drop in teacher production coupled with a loss in teacher training capacity in colleges and universities will definitely lead to a shortage of science teachers in the mid 1980's, when an upturn of enrollment is expected to take place.

Also included in the plan is the Mankato State University Energy Program which is designed to acquaint teachers with some classroom projects that can be done by students in grades 7-12, and give teachers an extended classroom project in which students evaluate the energy consumption of their school. Finally, this report presents the results of a questionnaire designed to assess the present energy programs  and perceived energy needs of Iowa secondary school teachers. The dominant concerns of the teachers surveyed were energy conservation and the political and social aspects of energy problems. (BB)",

This paper addresses the issue of whether this unequal representation of females and males is due to females' less adequate learning of mathematics or to deliberate choice of females not to study mathematics. After examining available studies relating to the matter, the paper concludes that when both females and males study the same amount of mathematics, differences in learning mathematics are minimal. Significantly fewer females elect to study mathematics and therein lies the problem. Factors contributing to this are females' lesser confidence in learning mathematics and belief that mathematics is not useful to them, males' belief that mathematics  is a male domain, and teacher treatment of males and females.

Differences appeared in early adolescence and were found only with subjects of above-average ability and on problems whose content is spatial or sex-biased. Eliminating sex bias in tests eliminates or reduces differences. The remaining differences are probably involved with social attitudes toward problem solving as a male activity. (MP)",

It provides philosophies, concepts, methods, and techniques for integrating environmental awareness in YCC camp programs. The first chapter of this sourcebook defines environmental education and gives six goals of environmental education that were a result of a workshop held in Belgrade, Yugoslavia in 1975. The next chapter discusses planning an environmental awareness program. It goes into planning projects, field trips, group living, and recreation. Emphasis is given to integrating environmental awareness into work projects. Chapter three presents activities to strengthen team work in the YCC program. It gives examples of solving a problem through group interaction, role-playing games, the process  and problem solving approach to learning, and teaching process skills. The remaining chapters present ecological principles and environmental concepts, an environmental awareness scorecard for evaluating student progress, a discussion of urban youth and the YCC, and the roles of Federal and State agencies.

The science and engineering (S/E) population surveyed consisted of individuals who held S/E doctorates or who had received doctorates in non-S/E fields but were employed in S/E positions. The 1973 survey took account of individuals who had received their doctorates between January 1, 1930 and June 30, 1972, inclusive. Subsequent surveys in this series continued to take account of the 42-year period by dropping the two oldest cohort years while adding the two most recent. Results of the latest survey indicate the following for the years 1973-1977: (1) There has been a shift in the work activities  of the S/E doctoral work force, especially in the areas of teaching and research and development (R&amp;D); (2) The educational level of the total R&amp;D work force has improved as indicated by an increase in the proportion of Ph.D.'s; (3) The unemployment rate of S/E Ph.D.'s has remained low and stable; and (4) Significant gains have been made by women and racial minorities in joining the ranks of doctoral S/E's.

Section II offers suggestions for teaching consumer education. One activity is described for each of the primary grades and two activities are described for use at the junior high school and senior high school levels. Activities involve students in identifying and explaining terms, problems,  and concepts in the primary grades, taking fill-in-the-blank tests and comparing prices in junior high school, and reading and analyzing economic materials at the senior high school level. For each activity information is presented on performance objectives, instructional materials needed, and definitions. Descriptions of the activities are given, also.

        "author":["Winsborough, Halliman H."],
        "description":"Research has shown that the transition period from a man's completion of school to first full-time job and first marriage has become shorter in recent years. The purpose of this paper is to explain part of the time reduction in this transitional period. Early in the twentieth century the transition took about 18 years because many men left school at very young ages. Now the transition is occurring in ten years. Between the years 1919 and 1950, the duration of the school completion process for many males dropped and age at graduation fell. During the latter half of this period and up to 1971, the military draft was operating. However, students making normal progress were deferred, thereby allowing the earliest possible graduation. The median age at first marriage dropped  approximately one year between 1947 and 1969, and seems to be a result of men completing school earlier. This post-World War II change in age at school completion may be important in explaining the post-World War II baby boom. Presently, the government is considering the reintroduction of the military draft as well as periods of general public welfare service for young people. Such policies may have strong unintended demographic consequences which should be considered in relation to population and social policy. (BC)",

Section I explains that MCE comprises moral education, moral training, citizenship education, and citizenship training. The author hypothesizes that current interest in MCE is an aftermath of Watergate and counterculture activism in the 1960s. Section II outlines conditions governing MCE programs in public schools. Limitations to program development include heterogeneity of values and life styles, discrepancy between classroom teaching and informal learning, and discrepancy between educational objectives and community-accepted behavior. Section III suggests conditions which would make MCE programs  acceptable in the community and in educational circles. For an MCE program to be generally acceptable, it should include a minimum of arbitrary content, practice in moral problem-solving, and instruction about values. Section IV explains how to develop and evaluate MCE curriculum. The final section briefly considers two other approaches to MCE. The first approach combines elements of values clarification, moral decision-making, and group interaction; the second approach encourages each school to select the program that best meets its educational and community needs.

Sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts, the program places professional artists in elementary and secondary schools for residencies of several days to a full year. Artists, educators, and AIS state coordinators who participated in the conference expressed their concerns about what was and should be happening as professional artists are utilized to help develop children's creative skills. The following topics were discussed: (1) defining the roles of coordinators, artists, and educators; (2) selecting artists and schools for participation; (3) experiences of success and disappointment; (4) the tension inherent in striving for uniqueness against the need to recognize  commonalities; (5) whether priorities should be directed toward benefiting the artists or the students, with consensus that a clarification of goals was desirable; (6) reports from state coordinators about problems of excessive paperwork, travel, and demands on time; (7) cooperation between the AIS program and state education departments; (8) the number of variables which make evaluation difficult to describe in precise terms; (9) the need for greater public relations efforts from the National Endowment for the Arts; and (10) the need to train teachers to carry on the program's work. Looking ahead, the conferees felt that success will be contingent upon funding and public support. A reprint from the Congressional Record gives an idea of the history, growth, and potential of the AIS  program. (DL)",

Developed for elementary grades, the curriculum is intended to enhance aesthetic perception, teach the arts, create a better living environment, promote general education, and use the arts in general education. It incorporates all the art forms: dance, film, literature, music, theatre, and visual arts. Chapters one and two define AEP's concept of aesthetic education and give specific goals. Chapter three presents 44 instructional units for the six elementary grade levels, giving content, instructional strategy, concepts, and objectives for each unit. Written by producing artists, performing artists, scholars, students,  and teachers, these units are designed to complement, not to replace, currently used art programs. Content includes aesthetics in relation to: (1) the physical world, (2) arts elements, (3) the creative process, (4) the artist, (5) the culture, and (6) the environment. Another chapter presents three case studies involving a third grade teacher, a fifth/sixth grade teacher, and a music specialist. Each teacher explains how he integrated the AEP units into his classroom, adapting them to the proper grade level and the existing school program. The document concludes with an evaluation strategy, a list of aesthetic education learning centers, and a bibliography. (BC)",

        "description":"This paper discusses job opportunities for women art educators interested in working with exceptional children. Within the next few years there will be a significant increase in the demand for art teachers trained in the uses of art with exceptional children. This is due to the increased sophistication of schools in identifying exceptional children, the current trend to mainstream exceptional children, and laws mandating the right to a free public education for all children. Several forces, however, may limit the demand for art teachers of exceptional children. Foremost among these forces are art therapists who are trying to replace art education with art therapy. They are expanding their training programs and working for legislation which will ensure that new job descriptions be  written to require the services of registered art therapists rather than art educators, artists, or occupational therapists. Action must be taken to prevent them from succeeding. The best preparation for those interested in using art with exceptional children would be a bachelor's degree or master's degree which provides courses in art education, art therapy, fine arts, and exceptional education, along with supervised experience in working with exceptional children. Programs which train art educators to work with exceptional children must have a fair share of women teachers and women students. (Author/RM)",

The study was intended to develop models for testing visitor response, provide useable information to museum staff, and test the feasibility of a large-scale investigation of science museums. Numerous tests and questionnaires were administered to visitors in an attempt to assess motivation for the visit, visitors' interests, exhibit preferences, orientation, attitude change, and information transfer. Results showed that the Franklin Institute audience consists primarily of groups, especially families and school classes. The average visitor leaves the museum knowing over half of the tested information content of the exhibits.  Attitude toward the museum appeared to be negatively affected by building construction at the time of the study. Most of the visitors showed a favorable attitude toward science, scientists, and technology. A project to orient visitors to the museum's structure and contents produced more favorable attitudes and higher knowledge scores. Effectiveness of exhibition in terms of complexity, background colors, and participatory devices was also measured. The report concludes with a discussion of implications of the study and a bibliography of over 40 resources. (Author/AV)",

        "description":"Educational psychology departments should offer to interested students throughout the university a parent education course stressing child development and the educational process. As a result of declining enrollments in schools of education, professors of educational psychology need to develop new courses applicable to new student populations. Already some medical and dental schools offer courses in learning theory and evaluation, so a precedent has been set. Furthermore, a course such as parent education is highly relevant and has a historical tradition. As early as 1820, national groups sought to help parents be more effective with their children's moral and religious development. In the 20th century emphasis turned to emotional and personality growth. More recently parent  education has stressed cognitive growth. Currently parent education courses are usually offered through home economics departments. These courses focus on family life, child rearing, and child development, and are topically rather than chronologically oriented. These courses neglect the important interrelationships of school, parent, and child. By covering these issues an educational psychology course could make a significant contribution to education. Such a course would examine the impact of the school on the child, and more specifically, the teacher's role as the facilitator of the child's achievement. The course would stress parental involvement and communication with school officials, and would cover the parents' role as teachers of their own children. The document contains a short  bibliography.

        "description":"The paper describes the different types of cognitive, affective, and physical conditions that constitute a school's learning environment, and explains how the learning environment can create and aggravate deviant behavior in some students. One element of the American school structure is group instruction: groups of students are taught by a particular teacher for short periods of time. The teacher's instructional methods may be favorable for some students and not for others. If there is a consistent mismatch between student and instructor (or instructional system), the student may feel inadequate as a learner and his aspirations for further learning may decrease. School administrators and teachers tend to accept low achievement from these students instead of remedying it. Once  students have been labeled as low achievers, they may develop more deviant habits, such as cutting class or dropping out, in order to avoid the uncomfortable situation created by attendance at school. One solution to this problem would be development of multiple environment schools, where students can move among various learning environments created for specific goals and learning styles. In addition, schools must be aware of the level of their outreach to students, effectiveness of problem-solving mechanisms, limits for acceptable personal conduct, communication processes within the school, and possible discrimination.

        "description":"A study was undertaken in Washington state to investigate voting behavior on the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which was approved by Washington state voters in 1972. Specifically, research objectives were to determine who was for or against the ERA, to assess the nature of objections to the ERA, and to consider implications of the ERA for family relationships. A random sample of over 800 Washington state residents was interviewed by telephone in December 1972. Information was obtained on respondents' age, sex, marital status, occupation, education, family size, political and religious affiliation, and vote (or attitude) regarding the ERA. Findings indicated that men were more favorable toward the ERA than women; single and divorced respondents were more favorable than were  married respondents; young were more favorable than old; white collar workers were more favorable than blue collar workers; and individuals with more education were more favorable than those with less education. Favorable decisions regarding the ERA appeared to be influenced by psychological variables (attitudes, values, self-concept) and by situational factors such as responsibilities of women and men in the home and outside employment. Additional research is suggested on the unequal division of labor in the home as an obstacle to sex equality and as a major reason for women's opposition to the ERA. (DB)",

An adjusted distribution of the population by age and sex is given for the latest census year, as well as for 1976. Projections of the number of women of childbearing age are shown for each year to 1985. Fertility measures include crude birth rates, age-specific fertility rates, and gross and net reproduction rates. Mortality is shown in terms of crude death rates, life expectancy at birth, infant mortality rates, and selected life table values by age and sex. Also presented is summary information on family planning, urban population, marital status, and migration. Other related items are  included that are not strictly demographic. These include number and size of households; educational attainment; school enrollment; and labor force by industry, occupation, and status. Also presented are a glossary of terms and a review of sources of the data. (Author/AV)",

        "description":"This study used survey data to investigate the level of class consciousness among working class Americans. On a multi-dimensional measure, workers were considered to be class conscious if they identified personally with the working class, felt workers were denied a fair share of society's rewards, considered the interests of workers and management to be at odds, and thought workers should stick together. Questionnaire data were gathered from 1365 workers living in 60 major urban areas. The results demonstrate that in contemporary America class consciousness is not fostered by factory settings which bring large numbers of workers together. This contradicts traditional Marxian theory. Two hypotheses commonly used to explain the low level of class consciousness in America were  confirmed. One is that the belief in the individualistic notions which comprise the American dream of success dampens class consciousness. The second is that the general affluence of American society blurs class distinctions. The study also shows that a higher level of worker class consciousness would make little difference to contemporary politics. At the present time class conscious workers are not more politically active than their less conscious counterparts. Numerous graphs and charts are used. (Author/BC)",

The research examined whether the tests' items were (1) directed primarily toward testing knowledge at the recall/memory level, and (2) comprehensive in their treatment of the discipline. Ten tests were analyzed, including the Hollingsworth-Sanders Geography Test, Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS, Form 6, Social Studies), Michigan Elementary Geography Test, and NCGE Intermediate Level Geography Test (Draft 2, Parts I, II, III). Using Bloom's Taxonomy, items were classified by cognitive level as testing knowledge (memory), comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, or evaluation. All classifications except knowledge (memory) were considered  to be of a high cognitive level. Content was categorized as geographic skills, human geography, physical geography, or miscellaneous. Results showed that the majority of tests provided a balance between lower and higher cognitive questions. However, the Hollingsworth-Sanders contained no higher order questions and the ITBS contained no recall/memory items. Most tests emphasized interpretation of maps, graphs, and charts. Only three tests included questions from 60% or more of the content categories included in the analysis. The NCGE Intermediate Geography Test contained the most even spread of test items across content categories. (Author/AV)",

The major objective of the program is to help students understand how basic relationships between time, space, and the cosmos have operated throughout the history of civilization. Students are directed to analyze schematic illustrations of cultural factors. The first schema represents a prehistoric period in which humans lacked concepts of the past or future. Other schemas represent basic categories of culture--intellectual, social, economic, aesthetic, political, and religious--and interactions among various categories. Students are involved in identifying component parts of each cultural category and  considering ways in which the categories are interdependent. Examples of interdependence are changes in economic climate in relation to availability of natural resources; effects of political factors (particularly government influence) on schools and universities; and influences of intellectual attitudes on social and aesthetic trends. Participation in the cultural history program should enable students to recognize cultural patterns, detect continuity throughout human history, and apply the category system of learning to other school subjects and activities.

        "description":"Three approaches to public administration are analyzed in light of their contributions to preparation for careers in public service. The approaches are graduate education in political science, traditional public administration training, and public management. The three types of programs stress different subject matter and have different objectives. For example, political science offers general knowledge about the government process, policy making, and methodological training in statistics and probability. The end product of political science training is a teaching and research position in a university. The public administration approach trains students to work in a technical or management position in government. Students are taught to develop practical solutions to hypothetical  problems within a short time. Students in public management programs, on the other hand, are involved in real work situations, generally as interns in governmental agencies or offices. They are directed to seek a desired outcome in a specific time period using limited resources. The perspective of educators responsible for developing public management programs changes constantly in response to the needs of public service. Trends indicate that public administration will increasingly liberate itself from political science departments; political science will continue to increase its involvement in policy studies; and public management will increasingly concentrate on program analysis and diminish its ties to political science departments.

To evaluate the significance of school effects, a project was undertaken to ascertain why students in high status schools were more likely to aspire to go to college than were similar students in schools drawing from lower status populations. Specifically, three perspectives were tested: school climate, characteristics of peer associates, and proportions enrolled in various curricula. Data were drawn from standardized test scores, student records, and a survey of students, teachers, and principals of 20 public, coeducational high schools in 1964 and 1965. A  statistical analysis was performed on 39 variables including student body ability composition, sex composition, status composition, and academic value climate; and individual student social background, academic variables, subjective orientation to school, and peer characteristics. Findings indicated that school variability in status composition was significantly relative to most other school differences. The conclusion is that because survey methodology current in school effects literature is not sufficiently refined to produce verifiable results, researchers should not jump to prematurely drawn firm conclusions regarding educational goals.

It was indicated that there is very little job-related or job-embedded inservice education, and most of the important options for providing training are not being utilized. The formal structure of school district and college related inservice practices appears to be much less effective than the help teachers give to one another. Respondents were favorably inclined toward collaborative governance of inservice education and for the establishment of local inservice organizations (such as teacher centers) in which teachers, community members, professors, and school district officials together develop goals, procedures, and ways of  solving problems such as providng time for training and relating inservice education more closely to the need for improved competence.

This study hypothesizes that there would be a positive effect on percent of time on task both for teams and for tutoring, and that there would be an interaction in favor of a team-tutoring combination. The subjects were 275 fourth-grade students in eleven classes in a primarily white rural school. Classes were assigned to one of four treatment conditions: teams and tutoring, teams only, tutoring only, and neither teams nor  tutoring. Results of the experiment support two of the hypotheses; participation on learning teams did increase the percentage of time students spent on task, and also increased the percent of time students spent peer tutoring. On the other hand, no team tutoring interaction was found, and there was a peer tutoring effect on percent of time on task in favor of tutoring. However, team learning techniques have had positive effects on a variety of nonacademic variables, including cross-racial friendship, mutual concern, and self-esteem, and it is doubtful that these effects would be obtained without the tutoring component of student team learning techniques.

        "description":"The debate about appropriate student-teacher authority relations in schools has persisted at least since the movement for \"progressive education\" in the 1920's, and it is reflected today in the debate between \"open\" education programs and \"traditional\" education programs. This paper, based on data from 7,361 students in elementary and secondary open and traditional schools, examines the role of school authority structures in the learning process. The paper identifies formal and informal aspects of the authority structures. Formal aspects, such as individualization of instruction and control of student assignments, differed much more between schools than did informal aspects, such as the teachers' classroom decision-making styles. However, the formal aspects facilitate the small  differences in informal aspects found between schools. Also, the formal authority relations are found to have a small effect on nonacademic student outcomes such as self-reliance and attitudes toward school, while the informal authority relations show a much stronger effect.

        "description":"The thinking processes of teachers as they relate to classroom planning, judgment, decision making, and individual theories or perspectives are examined. On the topic of planning, it is suggested that teachers do not seem to follow the \"rational model\" prescribed in teacher training and curriculum planning. Rather, planning seemed to begin with the content to be taught and considerations about the setting in which teaching will take place. Findings on teacher judgment about students were mixed on the extent to which teachers' judgments are flexible and responsive to new information. Teachers varied in the accuracy of their predictions of student achievement and the weights that they assign to factors that influence their judgment. The results of this study indicated that teacher  interactive decision making occurred primarily at times when there were interruptions of the ongoing instructional processes, and that teachers tended not to change the instructional process in midstream, even when it was going poorly. Teacher thinking and teacher behavior were observed as being guided by a set of organized beliefs, often operating unconsciously. The connection between a teacher's implicit theories and behavior appeared to be mediated by circumstances such as availability of resources, peer influence, and student characteristics. (JD)",

The proposal is made that three types of schools, each utilizing curriculum based upon one of these sources, would be effective. Each type of school would contain environments that reflected characteristics of the curriculum source it concentrated upon. One type of school would be solely concerned with curriculum derived from the nature of the academic disciplines. Another type of school would be concerned solely with curriculum sampled from  the needs of society. A third type would contain classroom environments concerned with curriculum sampled from the needs of individuals. The difficulty of containing the three types of curriculum within a single classroom is pointed out. The possibility of designing a single school containing various classrooms dealing with curriculum from each source, and employing a teacher who can utilize a model of teaching appropriate to that particular classroom environment, is briefly examined.

This objective was approached by means of a detailed descriptive case study of one elementary teacher's planning decisions for a five-month period. The study was designed to address a need for descriptions and theoretical models of planning processes and to examine the usefulness of certain decision-modeling methods for describing complex decisions made in field settings. Both ethnographic and information-processing approaches were used to describe distinctive features of the teacher's planning technology and to develop two models of teacher planning. The structural model identifies five levels of planning used by this teacher and  describes the goals, cues, form, and effectiveness criteria used at each level. The process model represents decision processes differing from the goals-alternatives-choice sequence of the linear planning model. Problem finding, problem formulation, and a design process involving cycles of plan elaboration and mental &quot;trying out&quot; are presented as major planning processes. (Author/DS)",

The test employs the technique of controlled, elicited imitation, which requires the child to repeat SE sentences spoken to him by an adult examiner. The method is based on the assumption that a child who understands a sentence--who is familiar with its syntax, phonology, and vocabulary--will be likely to repeat the sentence accurately. Correlates of individual differences in SE performance are presented for one sample of  HCE-speaking children. Possible uses of the test include further research on the relationship between academic achievement and Standard English proficiency, and developmental studies of HCE speakers as they progress through elementary school.

Automated Item Banking (AIB) is a computerized item storage and test construction system which illustrates these capabilities. It was developed, implemented, and evaluated for accuracy of estimates in an experiment with 1,502 airman trainees. The experiment involved determining item statistics on one group, constructing a test interactively, scoring the test on another group, and comparing the estimated and observed test statistics; particularly, the mean, standard deviation, and reliability of an interactively constructed test. These comparisons indicated that the estimation procedures were  sufficiently exact to permit a test constructor to have knowledge of the characteristics of a test prior to administering it. The AIB system permits rapid, secure, and error-free construction; furthermore, its natural language commands permit user flexibility. Appendices discuss the technical aspects and operation of the AIB. (Author/CP)",

(2) Do the behaviors and activity rates of males and females differ when they work on a task in groups with same-gender peers or in groups of mixed gender? (3) Are the behaviors of males and females working on a nonacademic group task correlated with their behaviors in a simulated classroom? The results showed no differences between the task oriented activity of males and females in single-sex groups. In mixed-sex  groups whose members were unfamiliar with the task, females were less active and less influential than males. In mixed-sex groups whose members had experienced the task previously in a single-sex group, there was greater activity and influence on the part of the females.

The ID is basically comparable to an intelligence quotient index. The SIS is somewhat analagous to a Socio-Economic Status (SES) index, while the DID reflects intellectual achievement independent of the SIS family background contribution to the ID Index. The use of the three indexes in studying findings from the Cycle II children's survey (aged 6-11 years) of 1963-65 helps to clarify some persistent issues related to intellectual achievement. The first-order  analyses revealed statistically significant relationships between the ID Index and (1) number of pregnancies previous to the birth of the examined child; (2) twin versus nontwin birth status; and (3) attendance vs. nonattendance at nursery school and/or kindergarten. However, these relationships were mostly attributed to family background factors reflected in the Socio-Intellectual index. Although the numerical index values derived in this report are specific and limited to the data of the Health Examination Survey Cycle II (children) and Cycle III (youths), the data base should have widespread applicability to behavioral scientists. Statistical data are appended, as well as brief notes on criterion scaling, multiple linear regression, and skewness and kurtosis tests.  (Author/CP)",

        "description":"To eliminate maturation as a factor in the pretest-posttest design, pretest scores can be converted to anticipate posttest scores using grade equivalent scores from standardized tests. This conversion, known as historical regression, assumes that without specific intervention, growth will continue at the rate (grade equivalents per year of schooling) obtained at the time of pretest. Data were taken from reports of 213 Title I compensatory education programs in New York State to examine the predictive ability of the historical regression model. The approach was to: (1) express historical regression in algebraic terms; (2) produce a linear model with assigned weights from the algebraic formula; (3) produce a least squares historical regression model whose weights best fit the data;  (4) compare the historical regression model with the least squares model; and (5) develop an alternative model. When compared with program-level data, historical regression underestimated final achievement for short programs with older children. It overestimated for younger children in long programs. An alternative method was developed which eliminated the bias, removed half of the error, and eliminated much computation since an expected achievement level for each child was not required.

Freshman engineers at Purdue University were administered the Purdue Interest Questionnaire (PIQ). Multiple discriminant analysis was performed on the six Engineering Specialty Scales of the PIQ using the obtained scores of 292 students. These students were then classified by means of discriminant functions into six engineering fields of study. Each predicted classification was then compared to the actual, fourth semester classification, and accuracy percentages for each field were computed. As a cross-validation of the discriminant analysis, these same discriminant functions  were used to classify in the same manner a second sample of 301 students. Then the two student samples were pooled together, a new discriminant analysis was performed, and by means of the new functions the group of pooled students was again classified as before. In general, correct classification percentages significantly exceeded the percentages predicted by chance. Finally, it was observed in the cross-validation procedure that consideration by the counselor and a student of the first-or-second classification choice as optimal for success greatly increased the likelihood of making the best decision.

Scoring  formulas are explained and the internal consistency, stability, and validity of the instrument are breifly discussed.

Decision-oriented evaluation is described as a process in which the evaluator has, as a major concern, the responsibility to determine likely decisions prior to data collection or analysis. The assumption that the link between evaluation and decision-making is direct and immediate, and that this approach is appropriate for all situations, is seen as a drawback which limits the decision-oriented evaluation approach. On describing the context-oriented evaluation approach, the author provides a three dimensional method for classifying the evaluation context. The first dimension concerns evaluation  intent and entails process, results with a predisposition, and openminded results. The second dimension of evaluation context involves whether evaluations are commissioned for individual or organizational purposes. Several organizational and personal motivation factors in this dimension are discussed. The third dimension, the evaluation structure, entails the extent to which those commissioning the evaluation have a specific set of expectations as to the areas to be investigated, the goals to be examined, and the role of the evaluator. The three dimensions comprise a method for providing an evaluation consistent with the contextual needs of a given situation. (Authro/JAC)",

        "description":"Reading and mathematics achievement and student self-concept were studied in 28 IGE elementary schools (schools using the system of Individually Guided Education). The data comprised 134 variables--input variables (student characteristics, teacher background, and expenditures for instruction); process variables (teaching time and school characteristics); and output variables (student achievement and self-concept). Several variables were consistently related to student achievement in reading or mathematics: (1) enrollment of teachers in a degree program (reading and mathematics achievement); (2) years of teaching experience (reading); (3) sex of the teacher (mathematics); (4) social maturity of students (reading); (5) social confidence of students (mathematics); (6) teachers'  perception of the principal's leadership (reading and mathematics); (7) job satisfaction expressed by teachers (reading); and (8) teacher involvement in decision making (mathematics). A set of 12 independent variables accounted for 78 percent of the variance in reading achievement, and a similar set of 12 variables accounted for 71 percent of the variance in mathematics achievement. All of these variables were susceptible to control by teachers and administrators. Further research is needed before claims are made regarding implications for instructional practice. (Author/GDC)",

        "description":"Successful performance on the California High School Proficiency Examination (CHSPE) gives high school students the option of leaving school early with the equivalent of a high school diploma. After two years and eight CHSPE administrations, the number of participating students remains low. Possible reasons for this are given, including lack of publicity about the CHSPE, and student opinion that staying in school is preferable to the alternatives associated with early exit. Although CHSPE impact upon the state was, therefore, small, state funding based upon average daily attendance was reduced by approximately five million dollars. Interest in the precursors of educational policy formation led to a study of high school organization and management. A nationwide survey of 2,000  public and 600 private high schools indicates that a great variety of nontraditional courses are offered in a number of schools; that alternatives such as work experience and remedial programs exist to meet the needs of different students; and that some high schools in every state offer early graduation or proficiency examinations. The author suggests that a better knowledge of school programs prior to policy formation, and awareness of new programs' effects on equity might result in more appropriate expectations for educational policy.

        "description":"The Teaching Events Stress Inventory was designed to measure the degree of stress caused by thirty-six events associated with the teaching profession. The inventory was completed by 4,934 elementary and secondary school teachers employed by the Chicago Board of Education. Event one on the inventory, the first week of the school year, was given an arbitrary stress value of 500, and teachers were asked to rate subsequent events numerically as more or less stressful than this event. Results were used to provide a quantitative basis for the investigation of stress, to ascertain differential reactions by educators with different backgrounds and situational characteristics, and to determine implications for educational policy. The 36 items and their descriptive statistics are appended.  Discriminant analysis revealed no significant differences for sex, age, race, or type of school. In rank-ordering of teaching events, violence and student discipline, management of disruptive children, threats of personal injury, assaults on colleagues, and verbal abuse by students were priority concerns. Management tension events, such as involuntary transfer, overcrowded classrooms, notice of unsatisfactory performance, lack of books and supplies, and disagreement with supervisor imposed stress upon teachers in the form of action constraints. Maintaining self-control when angry and teaching low achievers were concerns related to professional competency. Events which induced relatively little stress included teacher-parent conferences, teaching bilingual students, and taking additional  coursework for promotion. Recommendations are made for future research and educational policy. (Author/JAC)",

        "description":"The Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC) system was used to identify 1,734 documents on program evaluation methodology. Attempts to further characterize these documents by subject were only partially successful because of the lack of sufficient depth of indexing and design constraints of the computer system. Attempts to characterize these documents by type of publication were also unsuccessful because so many of the documents had not been assigned publication type codes. When compared with a 1976 evaluation bibliography prepared by the Evaluation Center at Western Michigan University and edited by M.A. Bunda, only 27 percent of the bibliography's references were also listed in ERIC. Further investigation revealed that 28 percent of the bibliography was published or  written before ERIC was incorporating such documents into its system, 22 percent were books or chapters of books (not usually made available through ERIC), nine percent were journal articles, and 14 percent were fugitive documents, which should generally be included in ERIC. Additional problems associated with non-hierarchical searching, system constraints on assignments of descriptors, and indexer limitations resulted in very little overlap between the ERIC search results and the Western Michigan bibliography. Researchers should be aware of the limitations of a search of the ERIC system. (BW)",

        "description":"The flight of white families from communities in response to school desegregation can be calculated as a &quot;cost&quot; of desegregation, and can be analyzed in relation to the &quot;net benefit&quot;--interracial contact--of various school desegregation plans. Moreover, mass media and minimally, community leadership, affect the rate of white flight. Data on 113 school districts, measured in terms of reassignment of black and white students by a court or local government, indicate that implementation year costs are greater when school desegregation plans are phased in, rather than completely implemented in one year. The greatest white enrollment loss in both cases comes in the year of implementation. Losses average out to zero or even a gain over a five-year period in all but 35% of the school  districts. All school desegregation plans show a net benefit in interracial contact. Analysis of news coverage of school desegregation shows that community leadership has very little effect on white flight or protest, but that the more negative the news media and coverage the greater the white flight. In addition, the average severity of protest in the first six months of the pre desegregation year also has an effect on white flight independent of the degree of school desegregation. (Author/KR)",

Black students were found more likely to be marginal, as were lower class students, males, and students with below average verbal ability. By highlighting differences between the perceptions of marginal and other  learners, the research findings also show that specific aspects of alternative school environment contribute, in part, to the persistent problems of students who are forced to the margins of their schools.

The history of the Educational Opportunity Program at the University of California, Santa Barbara, offers a case in point. Inaugurated in the wake of the Watts riot in 1965, and strengthened by later demonstrations on campus, the program began to suffer from administrative cutbacks and re-shuffling as minority power to stage impressive political acts waned.

Crisis mobilization, crisis management, and the dilemma of the reform organization are key concepts  employed in the analysis.

Two sources of educational growth are considered: (1) changing population composition on family background factors that affect how far individuals go in school; and (2) changing characteristics of the labor market and educational organization that are experienced uniformly within cohorts but vary over time such as to alter incentives to stay in school. Pertinent individual and societal causes of change in educational attainment are considered simultaneously in the analysis of occupational change surveys and published economic and schooling data. Grade progression  rates are found to respond to change in the labor market value of schooling. School quality indicators also strongly affect educational growth. Levels of educational expenditures, teacher salaries, within-year attendance, and school consolidation all vary directly with grade progression and, in places, mediate the effects of economic incentives.

Experimental students studied class worksheets in 4-5 biracial teams, and received recognition based on the sum of members' quiz scores. Control students studied alone, and received individual quiz scores only. Results indicated that the experimental students increased from pre-test to post-test more than the control students in the number of cross-racial friendship choices made on a socioeconomic instrument, and in the percentage of  cross-racial choices over all choices. Behavioral observation showed that a higher proportion of peer interactions were cross-racial in experimental classes than control. These results provide further support for the use of multi-racial learning teams in desegregated classsrooms. (Author/EB)",

        "description":"The main purpose of schools is to prepare the current generation of students to lead successful lives as adults and contribute to a worthwhile society. Thus any school policy or reform will be judged for its long-term consequences on the adult lives of its students and on the society they develop. Although the desegregation of America's public elementary and secondary schools is a policy that is established on the foundation of essential constitutional rights in this country, like any other educational change, it will also be judged by its long-term effects. Direct evidence on how school desegregation may influence students' later life achievements and behavior is difficult to find. This question not only involves all the research problems of studying immediate effects of school  desegregation with nonexperimental evidence but also, by definition, requires unusual over-time data to relate students' school experiences to their later life outcomes. To provide an overview of current knowledge, this paper describes the present conditions of desegregation and equity in higher education and employment, and reviews selected studies and theories on how desegregation of elementary and secondary schools may influence progress in these areas. This overview includes tabulations of government agency surveys that give the first descriptions of desegregation in higher education and employment. (Author/GC)",

        "author":["Becker, Henry Jay"],
        "description":"Changes between 1960 and 1970 in the private sector's share of a city's white pupil enrollment are closely associated with changes in the racial demographic makeup of the city. Even when holding constant such factors as the age of a city's housing stock and the ethnic composition of its white population, the private share of white enrollment in the cities outside of the South increased in cities with large black populations. The proportion of private white enrollment also increased in cities where the number of black school children grew rapidly but the number of white school children declined or remained steady. Differences in the amount of school desegregation that occurred, however, were not related to private school enrollment trends, except for high school students in  Southern cities. Additional variations in private school enrollment trends can be explained by social and political factors, but these factors do not account for the means by which the demographic changes that were occurring were translated into parent enrollment decisions. It may be that policies intended to financially support private schools greatly influence the rise in private enrollments in cities with large and growing black populations and declining white populations.

        "description":"This paper examines the research on &quot;pull out,&quot; a method or type of school organization for remedial teaching of Title I eligible pupils. Four major issues addressed are: (1) the educational benefits of pulling students out of the daily routine to provide them with compensatory education services; (2) the impact of such action on students; (3) whether a child is better served if he remains in the classroom all day; and (4) alternatives to &quot;pull out&quot; available for providing compensatory assistance to educationally disadvantaged children. Other related issues examined are: the prevalence of &quot;pull out&quot; programs, the benefits and/or losses resulting from &quot;pull out&quot; programs, teacher contact with and attitudes toward pulled out pupils, financial costs of &quot;pull out&quot; programs, and the  potential contribution of &quot;pull out&quot; programs to cultural separatism, racial segregation, or even racism. It is concluded that despite the near universality of pulling Title I eligible pupils out of regular classrooms for compensatory instruction, the procedure has neither academic nor social benefits, may be detrimental, and is used mostly to satisfy Title I regulations. Alternatives to &quot;pull out&quot; are recommended. (Author/EB)",

Using data obtained from Current Population Surveys, particular emphasis is placed on how the rate of racial succession varied among regions and was different in cities, suburbs, and nonmetropolitan areas. These data are also used to compare the characteristics of blacks who replaced whites and whites who replaced blacks in housing units. Black inmover households are compared to white outmover households in terms of family type and socioeconomic status. In addition, blacks who replaced whites in a given housing unit are compared with other black movers and the whites who were replaced are compared to other white movers.  The data support the idea that black husband-wife couples with children lead the way in replacing white households. A list of references is provided. (Author/EB)",

After clarifying what is meant by formative and summative evaluation, the author describes and explains the role of confirmative evaluation, an evaluation analagous to formative and summative evaluation but pertaining to programs that have been implemented for some time and are now up for review. A non-valid evaluation role, justificative evaluation, is also described and explained, and guidelines for obviating a need for that role are suggested. (Justificative evaluation is defined as an attempt to justify the  design after the fact.) Finally, a list of conditional rules suggesting when to and not to use formative, summative, confirmative, and justificative evaluations is presented. (Author/BM)",

Data were collected on students and instructors in three treatment conditions: (1) instruction with the PLATO-Based Training System on the content of the common course segment; (2) instruction with several of the PLATO lessons, with the same material presented via conventional classroom lecture methods; and (3) no PLATO instruction. Achievement data were collected and pre- and post-tests, and attitude data were collected in one instructor and  two student questionnaires. Analyses indicated that students' positive perception of effectiveness in PLATO lessons was associated with better achievement gains, and frustration and stress of learning led to less favorable achievement. Positive attitudes of instructors toward the PLATO lessons had a favorable effect on the students. (CMV)",

Background for understanding the nature of the study is provided by a brief discussion of the distribution of racial groups in rural Alaska and an outline of the distribution of access to commercial and public television. The conceptual model for the research was designed to anticipate the most likely areas that might be changed through the influence of television and consisted of three components--(1) active influences of programming content  on the individual viewer, (2) replacive influences of the act of television viewing on the social characteristics of the community, and (3) holistic influences by which active and replacive influences combine to restructure the viewer's relationship with the social and physical environment. Data gathered through observation and a battery of tests were entered into the files in the format of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Findings are discussed, and a detailed TV Study Codebook for these data is appended. A bibliography is included. (RAO)",

Determination of what information is required of the  scene, its environment, and the sensor, and generation of realistic imagery from it so that the imagery using lesser amounts of data could be generated for various user applications was the approach taken. This would make possible an assessment of the impact on the data base for a given application and level of detail in the imagery. The work reported was all directed toward generating images of the hospital scene, which is one of 16 different scenes in the Air Force Human Resources Laboratory (AFHRL) Seasonal Sensor Handbook and would be useful for tactical or training purposes.

It was concluded that assumptions about the inherent value of graphics for instructional purposes are unsubstantiated by empirical evidence, and the conditions under which the use of graphics may increase instructional effectiveness remain to be determined. Comparisons between alphanumeric and graphic displays and between different graphic representations suggest that future research should systematically explore the use of graphics as a function of task requirements, subject matter content, and learner characteristics. The research also suggests that the interpretation of research outcomes is contingent upon the dependent  measures obtained and that particular attention should be given to measures of delayed retention.

Survey results indicated that only 56% of all students enrolled with the intent of preparation for employment in the career area of the program. Many enrolled with short duration objectives that could be met by completing a few courses. Enrollment patterns indicated that 63% of those students who enrolled as full-time students in fall 1974 were still enrolled during fall 1975; continuation rate for part-time students was 46%. Many students did not continue because they had completed their objectives, others withdrew temporarily because of other responsibilities. Of graduates, 84% were  employed either full- or part-time. Of all former students, 16% were continuing their education. When asked how they found their present job, 55% reported finding it on their own, 19% continued in a prior job, 11% were assisted by college personnel, and 1.9% successfully used the college placement office. Former students with two to three years of community college education had a median monthly salary which was $216 higher than those with one year or less of college. Approximately 82% of graduates were either &quot;satisfied&quot; or &quot;very satisfied&quot; with their present job. Data tables outline the results. (MB)",

Third phase data are compared to that of the first and second phases. Findings revealed that, of a sample of entering students, 54% return for a second semester, 34% return for a third semester, and 24% return for a fourth semester. Persisters, in contrast to non-returning students, are more often male, 18 to 19 years of age upon enrolling, full-time students, pursuing an associate of arts degree or transfer credit, making annual incomes over $10,000, and  living with their parents. The majority of persisters and non-returning students work full-time. There were no significant differences between the self-ratings of entering, persisting, and non-returning students on numerous abilities. Respondents' ratings of college services and instruction were generally favorable. Reasons most frequently cited for not returning were &quot;decided to take a break in my studies&quot; and &quot;completed needed courses.&quot; Appendices contain student comments and the survey instruments.

The college's first statement of philosophy provided for a broad community services program. Later policies adopted by the Board of Education supported the involvement of the college in the growth of the community schools--offering encouragement, leadership, resources, and training whenever possible. In addition to describing CCC involvement in the establishment of nine community schools and in their periods of development, this report outlines the mechanics  of cooperative efforts in the following areas: (1) the roles of the community college and the community schools in community education; (2) statements of philosophy; (3) cooperative agreements; (4) organizational charts and job descriptions; (5) staffing models; (6) advisory councils; (7) interest surveys and evaluation procedures; (8) funding; (9) salaries and fee policies; and (10) six components of community education. Illustrations and examples are provided in each section. In addition, the future possibilities of community college/community school cooperation in Clackamas County are explored. (MB)",

        "description":"Data based on the Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS) for the years 1970-71 through 1975-76 are presented that focus on trends in associate degrees and other formal awards below the baccalaureate. Emphasis is placed on comparable data for curriculum categories and divisions, types of institutional units, and classification of awards. The information is useful in forecasting employment opportunities, particularly in relation to the educational and employment status of women, whose enrollments in associate degree programs have been increasing. Degrees and awards requiring less than two years of work are not included, nor are data from non-traditional and non-degree-granting institutions. Highlights include the following: (1) the number of sub-baccalaureate degrees  awarded increased by 54.9% in the six-year period studied; (2) although men still outnumbered women among degree recipients, women's representation increased from 42.8% to 46.2% over the six-year period; (3) there was a sharp increase to 48.5% in the number of women receiving degrees in science/engineering curriculums; (4) there was a marked shift for both men and women away from the arts and sciences and general programs toward occupational programs; and (5) the greatest proportion of sub-baccalaureate degrees were earned at two-year public institutions, which showed a 61.2% increase in awards since 1970-71.

Richard Hey presents an overview of trends in lifestyles in the United States, discussing the changing roles of women, new structures of primary relationships, mid-life career change, increased lifespan, and attitudes toward materialism and sexuality. In a second presentation, William L. Abbott reviews higher education's response to the technological revolution in relation to the effects of changes in technology on labor, management, and education, to the role of technical and community colleges, to student attitudes toward their education, and to educational responses to workers' needs to change career direction. Two papers, by Hazel Reinhardt and James Hickman,  discuss demography. Ms. Reinhardt summarizes sociological and demographic trends such as the increase of an older population through a decline in the fertility rate and a rise in life expectancy, expanded participation of women in the labor force, growth of service occupations, and the phenomenon of population migration and distribution. Dr. Hickman illustrates other trends with graphs outlining birth rates, labor force participation, and changing age composition. Results of small group discussions by conference participants and summations of the conference presentations are reported and appendices are included. (MB)",

The assessment was initiated by college administrators who needed information to plan appropriate programs and services for the residents living in a newly created service area. The material in the document is organized in three major areas: background of the problem, the needs assessment process, and conclusions. The background setting describes the general environmental factors surrounding the needs assessment study, including demographic considerations, the need for information, and preliminary plans for implementing the needs assessment project. The needs assessment process includes a step by step review of the  procedure, the rationale, and significant observations. Aspects of the process include: (1) assessing resources; (2) reviewing other assessment projects; (3) establishing a survey team; (4) meeting with key groups; (5) developing a research design (population stratification, selecting the sample, and collection of data); and (6) holding a meeting after completion of the survey. The conclusions reflect on the outcomes and the significance of the process. Data tables outline demographic information. The survey instrument and a bibliography are appended. (Author/MB)",

In addition, the importance of systematic evaluation, revision, and change of the plan and the necessity of executive commitment and faculty involvement are recognized. The development of the first Master Plan by a president-appointed task force followed the systematic steps of the planning process: establishing institutional mission;  setting goals and objectives; assessing community needs and interests; assessing institutional current status; identifying programs which can be justified, approved, and implemented; calculating resource requirements; determining resource allocations; determining priorities and alternatives; and conducting qualitative and quantitative evaluations. It contains a list of planned educational and support services, immediate and long-range resource needs, projected campus missions, issues to be addressed, and a working calendar of the process.

        "author":["Hartnett, Carolyn G."],
        "description":"Measuring student writing skills can be done holistically, by ranking compositions without enumerating their linguistic, rhetorical, or information features, or atomistically, by viewing compositions as collections of these features. A variety of holistic approaches, including primary score testing, exist. Though their reliability has been questioned, they have content validity and can serve placement purposes. Teacher, peer, and self-evaluation techniques can be applied to holistic approaches. At the other end of the holistic/atomistic continuum are the widely used norm-referenced tests of editing skills, such as the General Education Development Writing Skills Test, Cooperative English Test, Missouri College English Test, McGraw-Hill Basic Skills System, Scott-Foreman Test,  Mills' Writing Pre-Test, and the Test of Standard Written English. Critics of these tests cite immeasurable factors that lower the correlation of the quality of a whole essay with the quality of its parts. Recently developed procedures focus on the intellectual processes involved in writing, by measuring syntactic complexity, analyzing linguistic structures, and analyzing the degree of focus. Other recent developments exploit the capabilities of the computer in tabulating specific items such as mature word choice, natural language, and fluency. In addition to describing a pilot study of seven measures of writing ability, this paper describes and evaluates each of the methods of measurement discussed. (AYC)",

        "author":["Lombardi, John"],
        "description":"Collective bargaining in community colleges has spread throughout the country since 1966 when the first strike occurred in Michigan. Today, around one-third of public community colleges are operating under such agreements. Collective bargaining changes an informal faculty-administration relationship of unequals into a formal one of nearly equal parties. Because many policies and procedures are spelled out in contracts, administrators may be reduced to ministerial functionaries, especially in areas dealing with salaries, working conditions, and welfare provisions. Except for those in the top ranks, administrators have limited influence in the negotiating process. This deterioration of middle-management influence, plus the improvement of the faculty position through collective  bargaining, has caused middle-managers as well to seek benefits through the collective bargaining process. Collective bargaining is accentuating the trend toward greater state control by increasing the authority of the state executive branch in all matters subject to negotiation. One must conclude that collective bargaining is here to stay and that most administrators are making adjustments to the new order. Collective bargaining has not destroyed collegiality, and many ways remain for administrators to demonstrate leadership. (MB)",

The current re-evaluation of the early experience position from a life span perspective reflects a new &quot;zeitgeist&quot; which is the result of the convergence of five factors: (1) the continuing reinterpretation of Piaget; (2) the increasing usage of transactional developmental methodology; (3) the re-emergence of stage based developmental models; (4) the re-emergence of a strong life span developmental psychology;  and (5) the re-emergence of a &quot;sympathetic&quot; understanding of the child. The strong life span view, which sees the degree of influence of early experience as dependent on the existence of mechanisms insuring the continuity of those early experiences, implies the following shifts in emphases towards: (1) a greater appreciation of the distinction between species-specific and culture-specific development; (2) a greater emphasis on the importance of the continuity of educational experiences; and (3) a role for early childhood educators that emphasizes horizontal extension rather than vertical acceleration.

        "description":"The main purpose of this study was to address this question: When preschool children are exposed to novel objects, will their tactual and verbal information-seeking about these objects and the amount of information they remember about these same objects be influenced by whether an adult labels them as things &quot;for girls&quot; or &quot;for boys&quot;? Thirty-six white children (18 girls, 18 boys; mean age 66.2 months) participated in a semi-structured play session during which they were allowed to explore six stimulus objects, randomly arranged in three sets of object pairs (pizza cutter, burglar alarm; metal phone index with pop-up cover, magnetic nail finder; plastic number puzzle, hole puncher). At the outset of each session the experimenter named each object for the child and asked him/her to  repeat and remember the name, then she randomly labeled one set of objects &quot;for boys&quot;, one &quot;for girls&quot;, and one &quot;for both boys and girls&quot; so that in each session each child was simultaneously exposed to a (a) same-sex, (b) opposite-sex, and (c) both sexes labeling condition. Later, children were asked to recall the names of objects. Findings revealed that children tactually explored less frequently, asked fewer questions and recalled the names of objects less frequently when they were labeled for the opposite sex than when they were labeled either for their own sex or for both sexes. Children also explored less and recalled the names of objects less frequently when they were labeled for both sexes than when they were labeled for their own sex. The findings also revealed that younger  children's recall appeared to be slightly affected by the two labeling conditions, both sex and opposite-sex, while the other children were affected by only the opposite-sex label condition.

        "description":"The perceptions of middle class expectant parents, unmarried college students, and high school students about parenthood are compared in this study. A survey administered to these groups in Austin, Texas, indicated three major results. (1) Parents-to-be are more realistic than students about the pace of development of infants. College students are more accurate than high school students on a few items, and females are more realistic than males on a few items. (2) Parents-to-be are more confident in their ability to care for an infant, even though their levels of previous child care experience do not differ from those of the students. High school students are more confident in some of their abilities than college students, and females are more confident than males overall. (3) All  three groups expect some changes in their lives after the birth of a child--they expect to spend less time with friends, eat out less, have more financial worries, but be happier overall. Parents-to-be expect less change than college students overall, and college students expect somewhat less change than high school students. Thus, parents-to-be were found to have the most information on child development, the most confidence in their ability to care for a child, and the most positive attitude toward children and parenthood. It is suggested that these findings may indicate that parenthood education courses should be offered in the high schools and colleges to increase students' knowledge in these areas and help them make more informed decisions about whether and when to become parents.

        "description":"Williamsburg County, South Carolina, is an almost entirely rural area near the coast. Although nearly 50% of the population is under 21, there has been a sharp decline in population since its high in 1950. The outmigration, prounounced for black youth, is caused by a lack of industrial opportunities, although there is slow, steady industrial growth in the county. Although the economic base of the county is agriculture, the per capita income is low due to the seasonal nature of many jobs. Agriculture itself if changing, with fewer farmers on larger farms producing $57.5 million annually in farm crops. Crop diversification, introduced in the 1920's, has made the county a leader in agricultural production in South Carolina. The black population is twice that of the white but a &quot;home  rule&quot; form of government, desegregation, and civil rights have caused an equitable racial balance in county government. Seven local leaders interviewed in 1978 are generally optimistic about current and future development in Williamsburg County. They note recent improvements in government organization and county services, including the Williamsburg Council on Aging. The Council, chartered in 1974, provides county-wide programs and services for the elderly on an annual budget of $185,000. (SB)",

The students were given the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory and Nowicky-Strickland Locus of Control Scale during the fall of the 1975-76 school year. Results indicated that Indian and white children did not significantly differ in their developmental level of self esteem until the junior high school grades. At that time Indian children were significantly lower in self esteem and this difference persisted through the high school grades. Concerning the development of locus of control, both groups tended to become more internal with age. (Internal  control of reinforcement was the degree to which an individual believed his reinforcements were dependent upon his own behaviors; external controls were those forces he felt to be beyond his control, such as luck or chance.) White children perceived themselves as having more control over their actions. The only exceptions to this were found at the twelfth grade and only for males. Locus of control was significantly related to self esteem for both Indian and white children at all three grade levels. For twelfth grade students the relationship varied according to ethnicity; it was significantly stronger for Indians than whites. (DS)",

Scores for 170 Indian students and 197 white students assessed five categories of defenses: turning against object, projection, principalization, turning against self, and reversal. No significant differences were determined in any of the five defense categories for Indian and white females. However, differences in choice of defensive strategies were evident for Indian and white males in two categories. Towards the end of the adolescent stage white males were seen to utilize defenses which dealt with conflict through attacking a real or  presumed external frustration object more frequently than did Indian males; Indian males did not choose to turn their aggressions and frustrations toward an external frustrating object with the same frequency. When faced with anxiety producing situations contained within the test, Indian males tended to use denial, repression and reaction formation with a higher frequency than did white males. Indian child-rearing practices may facilitate the development of defensive strategies that involve turning aggression toward an external object. (DS)",

        "description":"For American Indian students, math anxiety and math avoidance are the most serious obstacles to general education and to the choice of scientific careers. Indian students interviewed generally exhibited fear and loathing of mathematics and a major lack of basic skills which were caused by a missing or negative impression of the mathematics capabilities of Native Americans, a generally negative image of mathematicians and scientists, dislike and fear of math forms without visible application to daily life and which require abstraction as a major tool, a perception of math courses and requirements as rigid, and a self-perception, often fostered by school couselors, of hopeless inadequacy in math skills. Because most of the students interviewed had attended public schools the  implication is that public school math and science preparation is lacking for all, but especially for minority students. Changing math instruction can help remedy the situation. Some successful attempts at math instruction for Indian students employ a supportive atmosphere for math learning; individualized, non-competitive programs, tutorials, math anxiety clinics, exposure to Indian role models, courses with an applied focus directly related to a career or community need, and initial math skills education based on everyday mathematics.

The recommendations explore two topics new to the Task Force (bilingual education and health care services) and reconsider five previously unresolved issues: early childhood education, planning and evaluation, teacher training, public information, and information and credit exchange. Bilingual education, different from migrant education, should be available for those migrant students who cannot function in a traditional English language instructional program. English skills should be developed via  teaching English as a second language. Health care services must be stressed in view of the high rates of early death and communicable disease among migrant workers. Among other things, the Migrant Student Record Transfer System (MSRTS) health record should match that of other health service programs. The MSRTS health records of migrant children residing. in non-Title I areas should be available to clinics and private physicians to promote the continuity of medical care. The Task Force will now present its recommendations to appropriate legislatures and agencies. (SB)",

HMSS units are organized around the three themes. Two of the themes, the Fluid Earth and the Living Ocean, together represent the traditional areas of oceanography.

The extent to which the calculator coincides with youngsters' conceptions of the nature of mathematics and the extent to which that instrument is at odds with what they believe about mathematics needs to be explored.

        "description":"This guide contains concept based lessons and activities in economics for use with students in grades 4-6. One component of a two-part publication, the guide demonstrates how the conceptual structure of the economics discipline presented in the first publication (ED 148 648) can be used to help students at the intermediate grade level make more effective economic decisions. By selecting lessons to supplement existing courses or texts, teachers will be able to upgrade the quantity and quality of economics instruction. The concepts taught are: scarcity, costs, property and economic systems, demand and supply, competition versus monopoly, money and banking, and inflation and deflation. Part One, which comprises about half of the publication, contains 16 classroom tested lessons.  Most of the activities include group interaction and discussion, involving students in simulations and role playing situations. Each lesson contains a description of concepts to be taught, a rationale, objectives, specific teaching procedures, students materials, followup activities, and evaluation questions. Part two contains three units of study involving students in organizing a company, producing a product, and selling it to demanders; analyzing and critiquing economic commentaries made by political cartoonists; and building a town in the days of the Gold Rush. The third part of the guide describes an experience-based instructional system called Systems: The Mini-Society. In this activity students create their own society and make economic decisions the consequences of which affect  their lives. (Author/RM)",

Information is based on analysis of data derived from a survey questionnaire administered to 39 selected social studies teacher educators throughout the country. The monograph is presented in three major sections. Sections I and II focus on teacher education at the elementary and secondary levels. Eight categories treated at both levels were institutional trends (integration of social studies with other subject areas, improved teaching methods), back to basics (inquiry skills stressed), the shrinking job market (most often ignored by teacher educators), new content (often infused into existing curriculum), multicultural education (high interest but slow  program development), exceptional students (usually a wait and see attitude), competition with other subjects (some resources lost through mathematics and reading mandates, fragmentation), and competency based teacher certification (under study). Trends, issues, needs, and promising practices in each of the categories are discussed. Section III offers recommendations for program development, policy action, and research. Recommendations include that social studies teacher educators should establish a national network and dialogue regarding the status and future of teacher education at undergraduate and postbaccalaureate levels. The appendix includes a copy of the 26-item questionnaire and a listing of teacher education resources. (DB)",

Lessons are categorized into four main skill areas: (1) using reference aids; (2) understanding tables, graphs, and cartoons; (3) developing graphic skills; and (4) evaluating information. For each skill area, information is presented on general objectives, skill categories, vocabulary, and materials. The lessons, presented in the form of worksheets which students are directed to complete, can be used in any sequence, emphasize general social studies concepts, and can be used in a wide variety of courses and grade level settings. Activities involve students in filling in the blanks, analyzing readings, discussing issues in class, answering  questions about graphs, charts, and tables, and interpreting tables of contents. By participating in the program, students will reinforce skills such as using library reference aids, using books and magazines, constructing and interpreting tables, graphs, and cartoons, identifying continents and oceans, reading map directions, locating places on maps and globes, calculating mileage, identifying fact, opinion, and bias, identifying primary and secondary sources, and assessing source reliability.

In a study of the development of an eighth grade biology unit in Israel, the authors examined the characteristics of and relationships between the activities of external developers and teachers. Analysis of the first phase, material development by an external group, involved examination of various versions of the curriculum material, minutes of meetings, and comments of development team members. It was found that the developers made changes in transforming research in the field of biology into eighth grade level curriculum material. These changes included simplifications of content,  omissions, and changes in style and forms of expression. Analysis of the second phase, implementation of the unit by teachers, involved a survey of the 20 teachers who used the unit. It was found that the teachers spent more time on the unit than was specified in the teacher's guide, used more teaching strategies than were outlined in the guide, and emphasized approximately the same content as was stressed in the guide. Additional research is needed to explore the impact of personal characteristics of developers and teachers upon the process of curriculum development. (AV)",

The study focuses on pressures facing both students and teachers over 15 months. The three major parts of the book discuss the roots of Judaic traditions, social organization, and hindrances of tradition. In Part I the tradition of Chassidic Judaism and the academic tradition of Judaism are discussed. In Part II the social organization of the Lubavitcher school is outlined. Topics discussed include the structuring of tradition, the organization of time and activity, the ceremonial organization of tradition, and the formal organization of knowledge. Part III  examines patterns of social interaction and the informal knowledge conveyed in social groups. Finally, the impact of a tradition beset by contradictions on students' lives is analyzed. Research techniques and methodology adapted from anthropological literature are described in the appendix. (KC)",

The principles have been extrapolated from John Dewey's theory of experience (&quot;Experience and Education,&quot; 1938). They are discussed in this paper in terms of several existing curriculum materials for elementary and secondary education. The first principle is that the selection of learning experiences should be based upon the continuity and interaction of the learner's past, present, and future experiences. The second principle states that sequencing of curriculum should be based upon the development of the learner's experiential continuum. The experiential continuum is the cumulative result of the learner using the knowledge gained from one experience to understand more fully the  meaning of his next experience. The third principle is that action and reflection should be used in reviewing learning experiences. Examples of action are field-experience projects; examples of reflection are class discussion and role play. The fourth principle is that subject matter should be discovered by the learner through a process of inquiry as he explores the significance of each learning experience. (Author/AV)",

A review of the socio/cultural behavior based upon Saudi religious belief can provide insight to educators on how to make educational and research activities in developing nations more relevant to people with a non-Western frame of reference. Among muslims, personal responsibility for the moral ordering of the natural world is considered a strong mandate. Also, important in Moslem culture are male camaraderie, hospitality, personal tranquility, social harmony, refined courtesy, social solidarity, and a view of all activities as integral parts of one's role as a human being. To develop educational programs in accordance with Saudis' frame of reference, educators should devise curriculum so that  it consists of integrated and meaningful information along a theme. Educators should also encourage students to use impressions and intuitions when seeking answers and should avoid compartmentalizing data into artificial segments. Educators will devise curriculum which is more relevant to individuals in developing nations if they pay attention to values and social behaviors in the culture they are trying to serve. (DB)",

        "description":"Effective curriculum development and implementation may be achieved by considering the multidimensional nature of the term \"curriculum.\" A definition of curriculum should be considered in terms of its expressed, implied, and emergent dimensions. The expressed dimension is the written statement of learning objectives, sequence of contents, learning opportunities, and evaluation procedures. The implied or \"hidden\" curriculum consists of unstated messages or unintended learning. The emergent curriculum, derived from examining the needs of the learner, includes ongoing alterations, adjustments, and additions to the expressed and implied. When developing curriculum, the expressed dimension calls for devising a curriculum platform, organizing subject content, and creating learning  opportunities. Collected data of student perceptions form the implied curriculum. The emergent dimension involves a process in which the teacher decides either to take supportive action to motivate student behavior or begin action to eliminate sources of disconnection between the student and the curriculum. Implementation of curriculum is enhanced through perceiving teachers as leaders in curriculum improvement and the classroom as a unit for curriculum implementation, and assuring that a positive match exists between what the school requires of the teacher and what the pupils need.

Four sections of the paper present ways in which student perceptions may be used: to describe and compare school environments, to compare perceptions of student subgroups within the same environment, and to explore relationships between the behavior of participants and the characteristics of the environment. Examples are drawn from three major studies involving over 11,000 students in public and alternative schools in Massachusetts. Results of the survey indicate that generally students viewed their schools as discriminatory, not challenging, and deficient academically. Students felt burdened by extra-school priorities and  ambivalent about class attendance. Highly rated schools in the survey were those where teachers responded to students by observing their actions and seeking out their concerns. In comparing subgroup views, involved and marginal students, and students and teachers were examined. Members of both subgroups differ significantly in the way they perceive their school environment. Finally, the survey measured principal and teacher behaviors. Evidence suggests that principals who are considerate of teachers create school environments which students perceive as involved, humane, and friendly. A final section presents a method for planning which considers three dimensions of the curriculum: expressed, implied, and emergent (See SO 011 675). (KC)",

Problems which restrict reform tend to be a culture which opposes change, staffing, finances, a shortage of relevant learning materials, excessive centralization of authority, expatriation by the educated, and urban migration. Also counterproductive to educational reform are rigorous standards of achievement and the ethnocentrism of foreign educated nationals who fail to understand the culture in which they are working. Strategies to combat these problems include carefully selecting and working toward established educational goals, reorienting students toward their traditional culture, and improving the quality of  instruction in the classroom. Educational research and development centers which would become a center of authority in the system and laboratory schools which would offer a place for experimentation in educational alternatives should be established. Current projects in a Saudi Arabian research center include analysis of a leading Arabic language private school, an investigation of English language teaching, proposals for introducing computer-assisted instruction, and the development of standardized measurement instruments.

The second section identifies premises which can help curriculum developers identify priorities: 1) the social system of the school discourages change, 2) teacher interactions with learners are influenced by unnecessary regularities, 3) monolithic school environments discriminate against students who differ from the majority, 4) marginal students as well as marginal teachers can provide important information on  curriculum improvement, 5) cooperation between parents and teachers affects the attitudes of pupils toward learning, 6) the principal is a key leader for initiating curriculum change, and 7) the teacher must ultimately decide how curriculum improvements are put into practice. The third section discusses priorities for curriculum change. Suggested priorities include educational change at the state and national levels, research to determine positive effects of the school environment, analysis of relationships between students and teachers, creation of multiple-environment schools, and development of instruments for measuring student perceptions.

Administrators have gone along with student demands to minimize evaluation procedures, according to three basic rationales: that grades are inherently inaccurate; that they traumatize students, foster competition, and harm students' ability to learn; and that the categorizing nature of  grades defeats one of the essential purposes of education--to help students develop their individuality. Each of these arguments can be refuted. The practice of assigning inflated grades should not be continued, because it leads to a decrease in basic skills, gives students a distorted view of their abilities, and fosters mediocrity. (GDC)",

These systems function as a meta-language--a language for describing communication. Each represents one or more of seven major categories: affective, cognitive, nonverbal, activity, content, sociological structure, and physical environment. Most systems use specific predetermined categories such as \"teacher asks question,\" and \"pupil gives narrow answer;\" a code is assigned to each category and coded sequences are summarized in a form useful for decision making, by a technology known as interaction process analysis. Instruments vary according to number and type of subjects observed, setting, category dimensions, and uses reported by author. A typical  instrument is designed for group observation of teacher and pupils in classroom settings; it describes affective and cognitive categories, and has been used by researchers to describe actual teaching in existing classrooms and then to reformulate models of effective teaching. Instruments have also been used for teacher training and supervision, as substitutes for tests, as content for new curriculum, or to specify conditions of learning. Other settings include counseling situations, prisons, hospitals, and industry.

Student attitudes were assessed by a course evaluation form, and small group discussions were used to obtain teacher attitudes. A two-way analysis of variance showed no significant differences in achievement between the plans; however, significant differences were found in student attitudes  toward group work and toward learning center activities and materials. Teachers' attitudes were favorable. Cognitive growth occurred for both average and mildly disabled students in all three plans. (Author/CP)",

Self concept and locus of control were also included to determine whether improved prediction would result. Demographic characteristics included sex, race, and socioeconomic status. Students' postsecondary activity was classified as: (1) those enrolled in college; (2) those never enrolled in postsecondary education; (3) those enrolled in postsecondary education but not in college; and (4) those not participating in any educational activity. Membership in one of the  groups was used as the criterion in several multiple discriminant analyses, performed with different subsets of the cognitive, noncognitive, and demographic variables. Results indicated that aptitude was the best single predictor of early postsecondary activity. When an individual's aptitude was unknown, grade point average was the next best single predictor. Aptitude and grade point average together were the best combination of predictors. Race, without aptitude results, was not a predictor, and neither self concept nor locus of control were effective predictors. (MH)",

The interactive effects of motivational aptitude (including locus of control, academic self confidence, and interests) and cognitive aptitude (as measured by a learning task and the Lorge-Thorndike verbal and nonverbal intelligence tests) on learning performance and on motivation were investigated in entire fourth and fifth grade classes. In one treatment, students completed workbook activities according to a structured schedule. In the other treatment, they were allowed to choose time periods, within a two-week period, to complete the work; and to complete it in any order they chose. Both treatments were administered to the classes studied.  Simple regression analyses on selected aptitude-outcome pairs were conducted by treatment across all subjects, by treatment within each class, and by treatment between classes (using half-class means). Results generally indicated that classes having high ability and high academic self confidence benefitted from choosing their activities, while low ability, and low confidence students performed better in structured situations. Considerable variation between classrooms was also found. (Implications for future research and methodologies are discussed). (Author/GDC)",

Subjects were also asked how many questionnaires they had received, and returned, in the past year. When instructed to choose one of the four questionnaire formats and complete it, 54 subjects (36%) completed and returned a questionnaire; 22 chose the checklist, 17 the Likert-type, 14 the open-ended, and 1 the ranking. Characteristics of each type of questionnaire which  influence rate of return--such as physical characteristics, content, and administration methods--were analyzed from the answers received. Subjects preferred clarity and brevity; familiar but not overly personel subject matter; and convenient methods of completion and return. A humorous followup reminder, if any, was preferred. Respondents also wished to know the purpose of the research and the researchers, and to be assured of confidentiality. Non-response was predicted for questionnaires which did not meet these criteria.

Major program changes, based on evaluation, may not become obvious for several years; program actions may contradict findings and still be based on rational decision making processes; evaluation findings may have far-reaching effects which were not recognized and formally accounted for; personal interaction between evaluator and user may help to shape and redirect the evaluation process. In order to take these factors into account, naturalistic research methods, using techniques such as case studies, field investigations, and participant observations, are recommended. The evaluator's approach is one variable of naturalistic research. The evaluator's influence on the utilization of evaluation  information may be determined by: role choice; the extent of which user involvement is encouraged; the amount of attention given to the performance on mandated evaluation tasks; rapport established between the evaluator and users; and the extent to which the evaluator facilitated and stimulated the use of information. Evaluation is defined as a dynamic process; the procedures and outcomes of evaluation studies are influenced by multiple factors as well as interactions between them. Five case studies of evaluation utilization are briefly described. (MH)",

The emphasis is on alternative approaches to desegregation that could be successful in improving the quality of instruction available to desegregated pupils. Other studies done on institutional effectiveness are referred to and analyzed in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. The performance levels of students in different schools on verbal achievement tests are used as the criteria for analyzing the effectiveness  of different schools. Taken into consideration are race and home background of the student sample groups. Findings concerning the influence of teacher attitudes and characteristics, school characteristics, curriculum, and school affluence are presented. (Author/EB)",

Cross-functional study teams which have been used in the on-site visits have proven successful. The research process used by these teams acts as an instrument for improving communication among reference organizations and also as a means for  identifying and examining the conditions under which successful programs operate. Some of the prerequisites for educational improvement indicated by the findings of the cross-functional teams include the equitable allocation of resources, flexibility in school organization and modes of instruction, and the utilization of the total urban environment as a resource for educational experiences.

It is asserted that the future employability of many of the most needy youths was not improved because the Department's efforts to assure that State and local governments were operating quality programs were not successful at the sites visited by the General Accounting Office. Poor administration by the Department and by local program operators is cited as the major reason why many youths, mostly at the urban locations, were not exposed to the real world of work. It is also charged that the allocations of funds were based on the desire to maintain prior year enrollment levels rather than on the eligible populations' economic needs and the quality of past programs. Another  problem cited is that local operators often failed to target recruiting efforts to youths most in need. A recommendation proposed by this report is that Congress, before considering any expansion of the program, assure itself that the Department of Labor has taken corrective actions. (Author/EB)",

        "description":"Despite the rapid growth and popularity of the magnet school movement, little systematic research has been conducted on questions of vital importance in assessing the movement's impact on the quality of educational opportunities in big-city school districts. There are certain issues that are important and deserve immediate attention from educators concerned with the potential of magnet schools for improving and equalizing educational opportunity. For example, it is important to obtain information on the home environments of magnet school students as well as on their social class backgrounds. A determination on whether magnet schools are producing academic achievement gains, with emphasis on the achievement of students formerly attending predominantly poverty schools should also  be made. Another important issue to be considered is whether full time enrollment should be required for purposes of desegregation in magnet schools. This issue is critical in considering the prospects for voluntary metropolitan desegregation. In addition, an inquiry should be made into the potential role magnet schools can play in the renewal of central city neighborhoods. (Author/EB)",

In the second paper, five aspects of the problem minorities have in becoming part of American society while retaining their own identity are examined: (1) culture; (2) the experience of the early Church; (3) the Catholic schools as an integrating force; (4) the dimensions of the challenge to keep minorities in school; and (5) the response to this  challenge. The third paper looks at the statement of the Catholic Church on integration, discusses the call to action and the statistics on integration in Catholic schools. It also examines the problem in the context of voluntary attendance and tuition costs, as well as an agenda for integration and the process of implementation. In the fourth paper, an overview of the Diocese of Columbus, Ohio, shows what is possible and what is working in the process of integrating Catholic schools. The fifth paper, &quot;Lessons from Public School Desegregation,&quot; examines the impetus for desegregation, the constitutional base, class and a racist society, curriculum, educational quality, voluntarism in both the public schools and the Catholic schools, and research needs. The sixth paper discusses the  Cleveland experience and its implications for Catholic schools. The last two contributions summarize the conference discussions. (Author/MC)",

        "description":"This handbook is designed to illustrate how nine rural schools, along with area postsecondary institutions, planned and implemented guidance and counseling programs and to help others similarly situated to do the same. It contains the ideas, strategies, obstacles, and accomplishments of field test sites in diverse geographic areas. This document is organized in the following manner. The introduction describes the parameters of the field test and the methodology behind the development of the handbook. Chapter 1 summarizes the results of the field test across the nine states and covers such topics as these: How did sites go about organizing planning committees?; What roles did the planning committees actually plan in the program planning process?; What unusual problems were there  in coordinating program activities?; To what extent did postsecondary and secondary educational institutions cooperate in this endeavor?; How much time on the part of the coordinator is required?; Did the involved sites contribute other resources to the planning process, and if so, what were they? Chapter 2 contains recommendations based upon the results of the field test. Chapters 3-11 are the reports and plans from the nine field test sites. The individual reports and plans are followed by a series of appendixes that contain such items as project interview and reporting forms. (Author/BM)",

        "description":"A three-year program was conducted at St. Olaf College to develop new awareness and sensitivity toward changing roles of women and men among a variety of audiences including students, faculty, administrators, spouses of faculty, and parents. The major components of the program were (1) a Career Advisory Panel of ten women successful in nontraditional careers for women; (2) an annual scholar-in-residence who worked with faculty and taught a women's studies course; (3) summer study grants for faculty research on topics related to women's studies or the changing roles of women and men; and (4) a career counselor who coordinated the activities of the Career Advisory Panel, planned programs, and counseled students in life planning, job search strategies, and issues related to changing  sex roles. For both men and women students, data were gathered on choice of major (1974-1977); immediate post-baccalaureate occupation; attitudes toward the roles of men and women (1976 and 1978); expectations regarding level of education, success in future work, and lifestyles; and use and evaluation of the career counselor, the Career Advisory Panel, and the women's studies courses. Questionnaires and evaluation forms were also used to gather information on the helpfulness of programs and their perceived impact, and the Career Advisory Panel members were asked to assess the programs they were involved in. The analyses showed that, although there was only slight evidence of change in the student body as a whole, the program had definite impact on some students and some impact on many  students, both male and female.

The technique of frame analysis, developed by Erving Goffman, is presented as a way of bringing coherence to the formulation of problems related to transfer of training. Key concepts in Goffman's argument are explained, showing how those concepts pertain to training. An extended discussion of a sample training activity shows how frame analysis can help structure the activity for maximum transferability. Several implications of frame analysis for the conduct and structure of training are explored, and questions for further investigation are presented. (Author)",

The rate at which women are joining the work force has confounded all predictions and created unexpected difficulties in securing equal pay and access to jobs and training. The most direct discrimination, separate wage scales for men and women, has been resolved for most occupations in the industrialized countries. Yet women's earnings remain substantially lower than men's. Sweden is regarded as a model for other countries because it considers married women an important source of labor and has made provisions to accommodate them in the labor force. International organizations have given increasing attention to women's employment issues. The  International Labor Organization has emphasized education and training for women and a review of the effects of social security systems on women. The United Nations has provided for development of regional plans to achieve equality for women and to integrate women into their nation's development efforts. In general, labor unions have moved as slowly as employers in pressing for equal treatment for women. Working women's networks, formal and informal contacts among women for advice and assistance, are becoming an important force internationally. (LMS)",

This study is divided into ten chapters. Chapter 1 explores the realism of the criteria which are often applied to the evaluation of youth programs. Chapter two contains an analysis of youth unemployment statistics and a description of the modern milieu in which employment and training programs for  youth are conducted. Chapter three discusses techniques used by program administrators to reach certain target groups and the techniques used in their needs. Chapter 4 considers the strategy of subsidized employment as the major attempt to alleviate youth unemployment. In-school programs, both training and employment, are covered in chapter 5. Chapter 6 covers three types of on-the-job training. The effectiveness of employment and personal counseling and various techniques for supplying placement services are discussed in chapters 7 and 8, respectively. Chapter 9 focuses on what works for specific target populations, and chapter 10 summarizes the implications of the study's findings for future policy with respect to employment and training programs for youth. Each of the major component  chapters (3-8) concludes with a section on program design. (BM)",

For the years 1971-75, it received its funding primarily from the Arizona State Department of Education. Based on the Arizona Career Education Matrix, it covers seven areas: self-awareness, career awareness, decision making, employability skills, educational awareness, economic awareness, and appreciations and attitudes. At the elementary level, curriculum activities focus on self-awareness, self esteem, and an introduction to jobs; at the junior high level, on greater study of occupations and decision-making  skills; and at the high school level, on student's exposure to work and work environments. A Community Resource Center was established in Tucson and coordinates community and parent involvement. To determine the project's effectiveness, a third-party evaluator administered a Careers Test to 2,500 students in grades 4-12, evenly divided between schools with high and low implementation of career education. An impressive difference was found between the test results of the two groups, indicating the effectiveness of the project in achieving its goals and recommending its replication elsewhere. (The review process that this and the other six projects underwent prior to JDRP submission and approval is described in CE 020 214-215.) (ELG)",

This finding is based on reviews of six city programs and national program data. &quot;Special treatment,&quot; although required, was not defined in the act or implementing regulations. It was found that (1) sponsors' program plans varied considerably in describing special consideration provisions; (2) labor statistics on veterans served by programs were inflated; and (3) CETA and employment service program coordination was inadequate. To address these problems, some General Accounting Office recommendations to the Labor Secretary were to establish special treatment guidelines for  various veteran categories; revise reporting requirements to eliminate duplicate counting of veteran participants; and direct labor regional officials to give increased emphasis to assuring that sponsors and subgrantees list all public service jobs with the Employment Service. Other recommendations were made because it was found that the U.S. Employment Service programs (regular employment service, disabled veterans outreach, on-the-job training, and mandatory job listing) have not assisted veterans to the degree they could have. Generally, the Labor Department agreed with most recommendations, but disagreed with the recommendation that veterans should frequently visit local Employment Service offices. (CSS)",

An extensive review of the literature revealed that little empirical data on the effectiveness of various administrative policies had been collected. The Air Force also collected original data concerning civilian policies on the use of women in nontraditional industrial careers. A pilot study was performed in which information was collected from three industrial corporations employing a significant number of women in skilled industrial jobs; questionnaires were administered to personnel administrators, frontline supervisors, and managers. Based on the literature review, the data analysis,  and recommendations by respondents in the pilot study, it was recommended that the Air Force (among other things) (1) offer extensive counseling to new recruits and enlisted women, (2) emphasize the positive aspects of nontraditional jobs such as good pay and job security, (3) sensitize key personnel to Air Force policies affecting women, (4) communicate Air Force policies concerning women in a highly visible manner, (5) eliminate sexist language from all Air Force communications, and (6) perform an organizational audit to gather data on Air Force policies affecting women and identify where the biggest problem areas are.

        "description":"This report inventories the U.S. federal government's current expenditures of resources for international health and considers ways of better resource utilization and coordination. Presented in eight chapters, the report considers three major issues: (1) how governmental and multilateral development strategies could be reoriented to affect health, (2) how the international health assistance welfare image could be dispelled and its economic development aspects emphasized, and (3) how individuals and organizations could be motivated to action at the grassroots level. In each chapter problems/constraints are examined, and recommendations are made for improved health services. Chapter 1 reviews the foundations for U.S. international health policy. The second chapter discusses  international relations and health diplomacy. Chapter 3 emphasizes the importance of improving health care in the U.S. The following chapter explores the role of the private sector in international health. Chapter 5 provides a perspective on financial and commercial aspects of international health, and U.S. research efforts and their relationship to international health are investigated in chapter 6. Chapter 7 discusses U.S. foreign supporting assistance and its accompanying developmental strategy which emphasizes growth and coordination of basic human needs policy with U.S. human rights policy. The final chapter examines conditions that influence the availability of health manpower resources for international health programs. (CSS)",

The project, initiated at a Veterans Administration nursing home, contained four stages: staff training for collecting and transcribing histories, staff and resident interviews to obtain histories, staff transcription and resident editing of histories for incorporation into a book, and development of two courses (\"World War II Era\" and \"Red Letter Days\") from collected group experiences. Based on class attendance records and staff members'  and visitors' perceptions of changes in the thirteen participants' behavior/life outlook, seven participants showed positive impact; six showed no impact. In comparing groups it was found that residents benefitting most were characterized before project initiation as cognitively integrated but socially withdrawn. These residents became increasingly involved in interviews and tended to continue participation following experimental class completion. Persons benefiting least were frequently described as depressed or confused. Of the eleven nursing staff interviewers, 63.6% reported warmer, more personal relationships with their interviewees. Results suggest that staff and residents mutually benefitted from the oral history interview process. (CSS)",

Each description includes an activity overview, suggestions for using it, materials needed, evaluation data on its effectiveness, and an estimate of the cost involved. Examples of the training activities include these: educators and community persons jointly explore definitions of career education to determine the elements needed in their own definition of the term; educators and non-educators change places for a day to gain a better understanding of each other's work; and  teachers identify ways to use community resources and design action plans for use in the classroom. Student activity examples include the following: using &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; questions, elementary students try to guess the occupation of a &quot;mystery&quot; guest worker; through mock job interviews conducted by community persons, sixth grade students consider the importance of basic skills and those things which make a person employable; and with the aid of a resource person, students set up a mini-business to practice their skills and learn about careers.

Using multiple regression analysis to control for a variety of individual differences, the influence of \"internal-external\" attitudes held as a teenager on subsequent unemployment experience in the adult labor market is determined. The internal attitude is defined as viewing personal success or failure as dependent on one's own behavior. A sample of 230 males who were sixteen to nineteen in 1967 and were not enrolled in school during either 1968 or 1975 was studied. The results support the notion that \"external\" teenagers can be expected to experience longer periods of unemployment in the future relative to \"internals.\" In addition,  though not entirely conclusive, there is evidence that I-E is an important determinant of black-white unemployment differentials, with externality being more \"costly\" to blacks than whites.

        "description":"Young blacks today are not obtaining jobs. One reason for this situation is the lack of opportunity available to them to learn about specific job vacancies and to be selected by a hiring employer. Recent data suggest that black youth are as likely to attempt to find work as are white youth. The discrepancy between the employment prospects of black and white youth can be found in (1) the sources of job information open to them, (2) recruitment channels used by employers, and (3) the means by which employers evaluate the worthiness of candidates. Jobs are often found and vacancies filled by the informal networks among employers, their employees and business associates, and the friends and relations of those intermediaries. To the extent that racial segregation in housing,  schooling, and employment continue to prevent young blacks from having access to the information channels used to fill job vacancies and to the extent that employers continue to demand greater degrees of sponsorship for unknown black youth than for whites, the gap between the employment prospects of white and black youth will remain.

        "author":["Gottfredson, Linda S."],
        "description":"All 437 census occupational titles were assigned scores from the following five systems for describing occupations: (1) Holland's (1973) occupational typology; (2) an occupational prestige scale; (3) an occupational self-direction scale; (4) the &quot;Dictionary of Occupational Titles&quot;; and (5) the Census Bureau classification. Occupational reinforcer pattern scores (measures of reinforcer characteristics of work environments) from the Minnesota Work Adjustment Project were also available for 120 of the titles. Comparisons of the classifications indicate that Holland's occupational typology has considerable validity for describing work activities, general training requirements, and rewards, particularly when it is supplemented by a measure of occupational level. Results also indicate  that Holland's theory and future tests of it should take more account of level differences among occupations and specify more clearly the particular domains of job characteristics to which they do and do not apply.

        "description":"There is a great need to examine factors limiting educational opportunities of women, especially minority and low income women. Thus, it is important to identify funding sources for research and development programs which enhance women's educational equity. Possible funding sources include the Department of Labor and other federal programs. In the labor department the greatest possibilities appear in the 1978 revised Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), which contains research, training, and evaluation provisions. Other potential funding sources are labor programs such as the Office of Youth Programs and the Work Incentive Program and labor agencies such as the Office of Policy, Evaluation, and Research and the Employment Standards Administration. For example, the  Women's Bureau received a grant for a female Youth Program that includes efforts to achieve educational equity. In a funding search it is also important to examine resources such as project summaries and application guidelines published annually by the Employment and Training Administration's Research and Development Office and the &quot;Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance&quot; published by the Office of Management and Budget. Finally, it is useful to look outside large cabinet departments and into agencies such as the National Endowment for the Arts and to look at legislation containing anti-sex discrimination provisions.

        "description":"The relationship of initial duty assignment and precommission major in college to the decision of junior Navy officers to stay in or leave the Navy was investigated. Surface warfare officers were examined with regard to their involvement in one of the following sources: Naval Academy, NROTC Scholarship Program, Officer Candidate School, NROTC College Program, and the Reserve Officer Candidate Program. Generally, both the officer's first duty assignment and education major were associated with retention, across as well as within separate commission sources. Retention was found to be lowest in staff and supporting shore activities and highest in the type of ships (i.e., small combatant ships) in which officers probably experienced the most arduous conditions of deployment, but also  probably have the best opportunity to achieve essential shipboard qualifications. The education majors with the highest retention were fine arts, education, and social and behavioral sciences. Those with the lowest retention were architecture (other than naval), agriculture, forestry, humanities, and business administration. It was recommended that retention efforts should concentrate on the education majors with the higher retention rates, and that the development of a behavior model would be feasible and useful, subject to measuring defined pre- and postcommissioning factors, tracking the officers to all warfare and staff specialties, and comparing the retention behaviors of accessions from both wartime and peacetime periods.

Differing effects of degree-oriented/non-degree oriented instruction on residents' attitudes or career choices were measured. Six data collection procedures were used: (1) interviews with OSCI and Chemeketa staff, case study  resident students, and project staff; (2) observations (classroom and counselor/student discussions); (3) case studies; (4) instructors' self-ratings; (5) resident students' self-ratings; and (6) analysis of samples of resident students' projects or other outputs in four vocational education programs. The project's anticipated outcome was realized. It was decided that the project model appears transportable to other institutions and agencies at low cost.

Among the findings are the following: (1) speaking and writing skills, knowledge of production agriculture, and business management were all highly rated competencies; (2) the decline in the need for laborers continues but is expected to level off; and (3) over half of the employers indicated that those of Mexican ancestry could be trained/educated to handle any job in agriculture, whereas less than a quarter felt that women could.

Evaluation staffs from the four laboratories sought to determine community support of the program, staff and student perceptions of EBCE learning strategies, and the students' growth in career-related and interpersonal abilities. Outcomes from the evaluations included the following: (1) EBCE strategies have been proven  applicable to communities ranging from rural, small-town, suburban to urban and with different student populations; (2) significant growth in career attitudes and career knowledge was detected at most sites by a variety of career development measures; (3) students, parents, and resource persons were very supportive of EBCE; and (4) community resource persons were not only willing to continue the programs but were also willing to recommend EBCE to other potential community organizations.

The data gathered led to several conclusions: (1) students in postsecondary vocational education programs felt  they had received effective guidance, while these same students felt they had not received effective guidance while in high school; (2) there is a lack of formal articulation between institutions; (3) standardized course and program objectives have not been widely used; (4) students were awarded credit for competency, previous course work, work experience, and military experience on a very limited basis; (5) there should be more involvement of employers in curriculum planning and development; and (6) the state department of education should assume a larger responsibility in effecting articulation.

        "description":"A third-party evaluation was conducted to assess the second year's operation of the Experience Based Career Education (EBCE) program at Wichita (Kansas) High School East. The program proposal contained fourteen process objectives and twelve outcome objectives. The status of the process objective achievement was determined by interviewing program personnel and examining project records. Outcome objectives were assessed by administering several instruments. A pretest-posttest design was used to evaluate the attainment of the outcome objectives associated with academic achievement, self-esteem, career orientation, and sex bias. A self-administering check list/open-ended response form was used to collect summative impressions of the program from students, parents, and site resource  people. Three site visits were also made. A change in program structure also was evaluated. Students were allowed to enroll in the EBCE program for the entire school year, the first semester, or the second semester. The objective measures of the achievement of EBCE program objectives revealed only minor differences between EBCE and control groups, which are suggestive of marginal achievement of objectives. The third-party assessment labeled the program a success and cited improvement made in formerly problematic areas identified by the first year's evaluation (available as ED 150 285).

Instrument items were constructed after a literature search and work with consultants experienced in the areas of employee training and career development. Items on the employer instrument asked employers to indicate the career development activities they offer for women employees, to assess those activities they provide, and to describe those  they do not offer as either \"might be effective,\"\"not feasible,\" or \"not effective.\" In addition, respondents indicated which administrative arrangements, policies, facilities, and organizational patterns listed on the instrument described their implementation of career development activities for women. Although the data indicate that a variety of career planning activities are provided for employed persons by employers and educational institutions responding to the instruments, activities specifically designed to respond to the concerns of working women are not widely offered (Recommendations for improving career planning programs for women are provided in this report.)

In the first phase of the experiment subjects performed a block-design matching task and received one of three schedules of noncontingent reward, i.e., continuous reward (Group CRF), random reward on 50% of the trials (Group 50R), or no reward (Group NRF) regardless of their response. Two additional control groups received either contingent reward when they correctly matched a design (Group CON) or no pretreatment prior to testing (Group NPT). In the second phase of the experiment all subjects performed a pencil maze completion task under identical schedules of contingent reward. The results from the second phase indicated that groups CRF, 50R and NRF exhibited equal  performance which was poorer than that of groups CON and NPT. These results suggest that experience with noncontingent reward can produce response decrements in humans and that noncontingency, rather than any specific reinforcement schedule, is the critical factor in producing learned helplessness.

Thirty-eight percent of respondents had been victims of sexual assault, of whom 77% reported one or more incidents of attempted intercourse or intercourse against their will. Of the offenders, 86% were previously known to the victim. Sexual assault constitutes a serious societal and mental health problem. Studies based on police reports and those restricted to rape victims  only are inadequate, due to the numerous inconsistencies with the present findings. Suggestions are provided for research aimed at developing effective prevention strategies. (Author)",

It contains a brief historical review of the four-year environmental assessment project at Illinois State University and places the evaluation activity within that context. This evaluation was conducted to determine the effects of a mid-semester break (environmental assessment intervention) which was inserted into the academic calendar to prevent unnecessary stress, tension, sickness, and boredom. The majority of the paper describes the evaluation activity itself, including its goals, methodology, and results. A reflective analysis related to program evaluation in environmental assessment projects concludes this paper, with specific suggestions for future action.  (Author)",

As part of a larger study of attitudes and knowledge among 500 health workers, the attitudes and knowledge of over 275 dental and medical students are examined, at different stages in their professional education, using Rosencranz and McNevin's &quot;Aging Semantic Differential&quot; and Palmore's &quot;Short Quiz on Facts on Aging.&quot; The course of medical and dental education displays no significant deterioration or improvement in attitudes toward the aged. Multivariate analysis reveals a complex relationship between knowledge and  attitude scores.

As deinstitutionalization policies have been mandated across the country, a major challenge for institutional behavioral programs has been brought to the surface--i.e., generalization and transfer of skills from hospital to community. Viewed within the broader environmental design context, this task has been complicated by a new set of systems variables, which serve as barriers to deinstitutionalization. Identified and discussed are 23 distinct barriers to deinstitutionalization. These barriers are conceptualized within a five-stage hierarchical level of environmental design interventions--individual/family, organizational, community,  institutional and societal/ideological. Additionally, the results of a study which employed an instrument designed on the basis of this conceptualization to assess resistance to deinstitutionalization are reported. (Author)",

This is critical in the case of older persons who are more environmentally vulnerable than the young due to limited financial resources and decreased mobility. A group of 91 olderly residents in multi-story private and public housing participated in this study. Specific design factors investigated were: type of housing, floor level, distance to elevators, number of bedrooms, length of corridor and position on corridor. These factors were examined in relationship to several theoretically-relevant dependent measures: social engagement, morale, physical and emotional health. Multiple regression analyses revealed several significant relationships. Living on short corridors was related to increased  social interaction. Persons living at the ends of corridors were higher in morale. Proximity to elevators was positively related to the proximity of close friends. Home-owners and apartment-dwellers had more social roles and realtionships than persons living in rented houses. Findings suggest a human factors focus in architectural planning for the elderly.

Findings suggest that: (1) the area of sex roles is the most popular topic in the family literature; (2) child socialization is decreasing in emphasis; and (3) marital satisfaction and adjustment are the most frequent concerns of marital interaction research. The general conclusion is that the family field is  becoming increasingly \"adult-oriented,\" reflecting a more general social trend which increasingly views the family as a context for self-expression rather than as a context for child-rearing.

Of the three definitions of reading (decoding, meaning-from-page, and intellectual processes) the latter view, which sees reading as a broad range of perceptual, associative, and cognitive elements, is preferred. The three current conceptions of reading instruction are data driven (bottom-up), conceptually driven (top-down), and interactive; with the interactive view preferred, although most traditional reading programs which underlie the &quot;back to basics&quot; mandate use the decoding, bottom-up approaches. Traditionally, in intermediate grades, students are tested in comprehension, and those who perform inadequately are returned to the decoding tasks in which  they have already demonstrated competence. Remedial and beginning programs should address themselves to comprehension skills. The need exists to examine the content of the reading program to be selected through mastery, to determine what a successful student needs to know, and to provide language experience opportunities. Whereas the mandate assumes academic skills exclusively are to be tested for and taught, this is based on the inadequate bottom-up decoding model of reading; testing should be modified.

It was found that when teachers preposed questions (a popular technique), comprehension tended to be narrowed because students focused on passages related to the preposed questions; also, students attempted to satisfy the teacher's purpose in reading rather than their own. The student prepared self-preposed method tended to develop disgressive, irrelevant questions, and encouraged attention only to  question-related passages; this also limited comprehension. Best results were found with the schema self-preposed techniques in which students generated preposed, story-specific questions based on a schema of content-general questions. Questions were not only self-posed but were also likely to focus the reader's attention on passages answering questions that were pertinent and relevant to those asked on a content-valid comprehension test.

Results were used as a framework to compile an annotated booklist based on the following categories: coping with competition, divorce or other change in family status,  failure, peer group pressure, and alienation and rejection; and recognizing and accepting one's strengths and weaknesses.

In response to the &quot;know-nothing movement,&quot; the author outlines major aspects of a whole-language, comprehension-centered theory of reading instruction that he feels has demonstrated its effectiveness; the theory emphasizes continuous focus on meaning, legitimizing of risk taking, and continuous involvement of learners in reading and writing. Finally, he explains his reasons for rejecting the competency-based, highly structured approach of the &quot;know-nothing movement.&quot; (GT)",

An analysis of prose passages in a typical high school science text identified three basic types of graphic representations: associative (AR), comparative (CR), and directed (DR). Once appropriate sets of behavioral objectives were specified and graphic formats displaying each type of relationship were designed, three instructional treatments were prepared: text (T), text-adjunct (TA) in which the text was supplemented with DR and CR diagrams, and text-underlined (TU) in which the graphic information was simply underlined. Groups of 56 Navy recruits, equally divided into high and low science achievement levels,  participated in one of the three treatments, followed by free recall and multiple-choice performance tests. The findings were equivocal with respect to the advantages of supplementing prose text with organizational aids; although TA treatment was clearly superior in the free recall of DR materials, TU was superior in terms of multiple-choice test performance on CR materials. Contrary to expectations, no significant interaction between treatment and previous achievement level occurred. (RL)",

In the middle of the nineteenth century, the state entered the business of education on a large scale. Vast systems of public schools pushed reading and writing among men and women to essentially universal levels throughout western society by the early twentieth century. The classic arguments for literacy include the production of a healthy skepticism, the invitation to participate in a wide and varied new mental world, access to material prosperity, and the acquisition of the functional competence necessary to survive and prosper in,  as well as improve, the world. These goals have been realized only in very limited and frustrating ways; in an age in which two-thirds of Americans need assistance with their tax returns, and most require lawyers to guide them through the bureaucracy, functional incapacity affects everyone. Self-directed learning using library facilities is recommended as a remedy to widespread functional incompetence. (DF)",

        "description":"A study of 191 native English speaking working class children in grades two, four, and six was undertaken to investigate the development of reading comprehension of selected pronoun-referent structures. Three linguistic comparisons were made: referent type, reference order, and referent distance. Target sentences were constructed with these features and were embedded into short passages, each followed by questions based on the target structure. It was found that noun phrase pronominal structures were easier to comprehend than sentential pronominals, structures with forward reference were easier to comprehend than those with backward reference, and there was no significant difference between inter-sentential structures and intra-sentential structures. A hierarchy of acquisition of  reading comprehension was constructed for the various pronoun-referent structures. (Author/TJ)",

Three versions of each of six stories were created. The first version was the canonical form of the story predicted by story grammar rules; the second version began with a sentence which questioned the conclusion of the canonical form; and in the third this conclusion began the story. Significant effects of grade and structure indicated that the canonical form was more easily ordered than were the other structures, and also that third grade students were less accurate at the task than were sixth or ninth grade students. These effects were shown for pairwise and completely correct orderings and for  a confidence-rating measure. Additionally, children were shown to use an event-sequence strategy and to attend to various surface text features. However, the results suggested that the deep structure (story grammar structure) was of much greater importance in comprehension than were features of surface structure. (Author)",

Prosody (intonation, stress, and rhythm) provides information about phrase and clause boundaries in spoken language that is not available in written language. In an experiment to test whether prosodic information facilitated children's parsing of sentences, 20 above and 20 below average readers in the fourth grade divided sentences into meaningful word groups. There were two presentation conditions: a no-prosody condition in which the sentences were presented in written form only, and a prosody condition in which they were presented in both written and spoken form. The results suggested that below average readers have difficulty  parsing sentences when prosodic information is not available, but are able to parse sentences about as well as the above average readers when prosody is available.

Less able readers tend to overrely on processes in one direction, producing deleterious effects on comprehension. Factors underlying an overreliance on bottom-up processes include the following; schema unavailability or difficulty in activation; skill deficiency; student misconceptions about reading as being primarily a bottom-up process; differences in general cognitive styles; and idiosyncratic patterns of reading behavior eliciting a mistaken diagnosis of a given reading cycle. Educators should employ different remediation strategies for poor readers with  different comprehension styles, and should determine instruction by the cause of the reading difficulty rather than the manisfestation.

Improvements are necessary in the design of training studies, as are a reconsideration of the types of skills that are the subject of training, and a serious consideration of the relation of the training and transfer tasks to the everyday functioning of the cognitive process under investigation. Specifically, an adequate training program must include the following: careful selection of the cognitive skill to be examined; sensitivity to the actual beginning competence of the learner; stringent analyses of the requirements  of the training and transfer task so that transfer failures can be interpreted properly, training in multiple settings to alleviate the problem of welding, direct feedback concerning the effectiveness of the trained skill; and direct instruction concerning the generalization of the trained skills. Until a research program can provide answers to these basic questions, it is premature to conclude that retarded or deprived children and unschooled nonwestern children cannot show flexible effects of training.

In contrast to previous periods, the 1960s and 1970s posed a greater threat to advertising because of government actions; in turn, the industry responded with a mechanism of self-regulation far surpassing any previous efforts, and including methods of detection, methods of adjudication; and sanction procedures that were meaningful reforms in the area, although somewhat weaker modifications were adopted. This effort at self-regulation serves the trade both as a means of eradicating  deception and as a means of dealing with public criticism and its attendant threat of government regulation; indeed, there appears to be an inverse correlation between the rise of NARB and the diminution of criticism and government interest in advertising.

After outlining a humanistic approach to adolescent literature, in which students are taught to use literature to illuminate their lives, the paper contrasts such an approach to the teaching of traditional literature, in which the emphasis is on understanding the text. It tells how certain societal changes have promoted the acceptance of adolescent literature as a serious genre and discusses the classroom focus on sociological, psychological, ethical, and ideological aspects of literary works. It next outlines the need for college methods courses in adolescent literature and presents guidelines for the selection of adolescent literature that  are given to students in one methods course. The value of small group instruction in teaching adolescent literature is discussed, and suggestions are offered for the division of students into groups for class organization and for possible group activities. Finally, teacher-developed learning activity packets are described, the values of using them are listed, and suggestions are provided for incorporating questions and activities based on a hierarchy of thinking skills ranging from the factual to the conceptual and evaluative.

The second chapter analyzes the realism of the motion picture medium in light of the inherently illusory nature of film art. The skills and knowledge of the first two chapters are used in the third to achieve a visually literate critique of Frederick Wiseman's film, \"High School.\" The second part of the book concerns the teaching of visual literacy skills  as part of the high school English curriculum. The first chapter in this section offers practical suggestions about how to get suitable materials and what not to do in the classroom. The second contains descriptions of various classroom activities spanning a wide range of difficulty levels and includes some reading and writing exercises.

The technology that can be applied to student writing evaluation lags behind a reasoned rhetorical explanation of test results. Evaluations of writing are inadequate unless they are interpreted within a rhetorical context that includes who the writer is and for whom that writer is writing. Questions of quality thereby become part of a complicated context of interaction between specific writers and specific readers. The motivation and attitudes of both contributors to the meaning of a text ought not to be ignored; therefore, it is important to devise new descriptions of the affective as well as the cognitive aspects of writing and reading and to account for the  predispositions of writer and reader. An interpretive theory informed by measurements of variables in dynamic, organic situations is needed. (TJ)",

Students ponder what is unusual about a particular work through such exploratory questions as why the work is important, under what constraints the artist was working, and what individual responses the student feels toward the work; such questions draw the student into participation through inquiry. Implications for teachers,  administrators, and counselors include the following: establish a conducive environment for exploration of aesthetic appreciation; foster philosophical and contemporary aesthetics education in the teacher education curriculum; provide education for the arts educator to view aesthetics beyond his or her own discipline; use aesthetics systems education to teach about aesthetics systems of different cultures; and provide opportunities for students to share their aesthetic experiences.

The ratio method permits the critic to describe and understand the specific qualities of practical ethical dispute. Burkian ratios were employed to analyze the justificatory rhetoric of Clement F. Haynesworth during the Judiciary Committee Hearings on his Supreme Court nomination. An examination of Judge Haynesworth's testimony before the committee revealed 132 instances of ethical justification, which were coded according to the featured motives and ratio opposites that Burke has delineated. The findings indicate that Haynesworth relied heavily upon scene-act and scene-agent ratios, portraying himself as the victim  of a scene he could not control. This justificatory strategy was both rhetorically and culturally deficient because it violated the cultural expectations of &quot;judgeness.&quot; (Author/RL)",

        "description":"The argument for renewed theoretical development in the study of family communication has several implications. One is that researchers should concentrate on family communication as such rather than expanding generalizations from family communication to other groups and institutions; this requires grappling more specifically with the explication and testing of theoretical propositions about the ways in which family communication functions. The roster of possible hypotheses includes such empirical theories as reinforcement, selective perception, information-seeking, and de facto selective exposure. Methodologies that are quite different from those used in the past will have to be devised and employed. Firsthand observation, experimental variation, and longitudinal designs are all  needed. The latter is particularly important because the greatest implications of what is known about family communication have to do with developments occurring long after the child matures and leaves the family. Both observational and experimental ingenuity are needed to test specific hypotheses about the nature of the process by which family communication patterns shape the developing child's construction of the world around him.

Husserl's concept of intentionality provides a conceptual perspective of interpersonal communication that suggests a notion of face-to-face communication called \"interaction involvement.\" Structured along dimensions of awareness and responsiveness, interaction involvement explains interpersonal communication as a transactional relationship involving the elements of self, others, and situations. To test the validity of interaction involvement as a theoretical construct, eighteen questionnaire items were developed to represent the dimensions of awareness and responsiveness, and 326 individuals provided their responses to the items. Overall, the factor analysis of those responses provided reasonable support for the constructs of awareness and responsiveness as dimensions of  interaction involvement. In view of this research, interaction involvement appears to be a rather fundamental dimension of interpersonal communication, more abstract yet more pervasive than the concept of communicative competence.

The selected concept was &quot;pig&quot; and three of its synonyms--&quot;hog,&quot;&quot;boar,&quot; and &quot;swine.&quot; These terms vary in their frequency of use in English, which makes it possible to explore a behaviorally based theory of meaning. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of four conditions where they performed direct pair comparisons with one of the four &quot;pig&quot; terms, a series of barnyard animal names, attributes, and a concept of self. The means of these four groups were entered into a multidimensional analysis. In contrast to the logical assumption that synonymous words would produce identical multidimesional spaces, the results, in fact, suggest that the four &quot;pig&quot; terms are not really  equivalent, varying systematically in their meanings, in their use, and in their relation to positive attributes. The systematic variance in their meanings is such that each concept's distance from self on the multidimensional scale is inversely related to the frequency at which the concept is used in English. This further suggests that meaning is behaviorally governed, and that any symbol's meaning is an empirical question whose answer depends on measuring the actual users of that symbol. (Author/RL)",

        "description":"In the 1978 &quot;FCC v. Pacifica Foundation&quot; ruling, the United States Supreme Court considered the authority of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to regulate indecent radio programing, finding that the public has a constitutionally protected interest in being protected against objectionable programing. The FCC suit, arising out of a broadcast of comedian George Carlin's &quot;Filthy Words&quot; satire, focused on three aspects of radio which distinguish it from less obtrusive modes of communication, justifying special treatment of offensive or objectionable broadcasts: children, often unsupervised, have access to radios; radios are in the home where the privacy interest is entitled to extra consideration; and unconsenting adults may tune in a station without any warning that  offensive language is being broadcast. Confusion surrounds the type of balance sought by the Court in conflicts between intrusive expressions and privacy claims. While government may properly act in many situations to prohibit intrusion into the privacy of the home of unwelcome views and language which cannot be totally barred from public dialogue, no substantial agreement exists regarding when intrusion by expression constitutes an invasion of privacy.

The relationships between channel preferences and demographics, ethnicity, and communication channel patterns were also examined. The analysis revealed that the four major communication channels used were friends and neighbors (interpersonal communication), radio, local metropolitan daily newspapers, and ethnic-language newspapers. Lower socioeconomic status (SES) respondents relied more on interpersonal communication and on ethnic media, while higher SES respondents turned more to metropolitan media and magazines. Small size of ethnic group was shown to be  related to greater importance of interpersonal sources of information--church and correspondence. Suburbanites relied more on metropolitan mass media for news of the ethnic community, while urbanites relied more on friends and neighbors and the church. (FL)",

A search of the literature for appropriate variables to include in a more complex analysis suggested the use of perceived organizational effectiveness, loyalty, and job satisfaction as dependent variables, and organizational structures and organizational processes as independent variables. Instruments measuring these variables were applied to 114 schools in 12 school districts, and the responses subjected to multiple regression analysis. Results indicated that more effective schools, as perceived by teachers, are  characterized by more participative organizational processes, less centralized decision-making structures, more formalized general rules, and more complexity or high professional activity. The results also revealed that of three hypotheses based on a synthesis of the literature only one was borne out. This indicates a need for continued use of more sophisticated techniques to test the assumptions made as a result of earlier, less complex research. (Author/PD)",

Research studies in the middle and late 1960s in various work settings revealed the effectiveness of legitimate and expert supervisory power on worker behavior and satisfaction. The purpose of this study was to determine if this pattern would be manifested among public school teachers in the late 1970s. The Bachman questionnaire was administered to 683 public school teachers employed in Connecticut and Pennsylvania. The results generally paralleled the pattern of previous studies. In general it was found that legitimate and expert power were for public school teachers, like other organizational role groups and across various situational subcategories, the  preferred base for supervisions that expert and referent power were for teachers the highest correlates of satisfaction with supervisor's performance; and that the levels of institutional and interpersonal control perceived by teachers for themselves and for principals were also significantly and directly related to satisfaction with the principal's performance.

This study identified such elements in an interorganizational structure that was classified as a loosely coupled system. The interorganizational structure examined was the Internships, Certification, Equity-Leadership, and Support (ICES) Project, a project designed to test a model for increasing the number of women holding administrative positions in the Kansas Public School System. Data were collected through participant observations of the project coordinator. Project elements that promoted conflict included diversity of goals of participants, the liabilities of newness, the organization's brief lifespan, marginality of its goals to the concerns of cooperating  agencies, responsibility overload by participating administrators, and asymmetrical interdependence of units. A reduction of conflict was brought about by the project being a loosely coupled system, that is, a system of units retaining their individual identity and logically and physically separate from other elements. Although the loose coupling produced initial frustration for participants who expected clear authority relationships and quick decisions, ultimately loose coupling allowed participants to define their roles, responsibilities, and relationships clearly and to maintain enthusiasm for their immediate tasks. Loose coupling enabled the conflict-prone organization to persist and meet its objectives. (Author/JM)",

The paper discusses needs assessment, objectives, role of the superintendent, and an analysis of data. A program evaluation completes the report along with the following recommendations: (1) the board should hire a professional negotiator, (2) efforts should continue to keep salary and fringe benefits within the capacity of the taxpayer, (3) no further erosion of management prerogatives should be  allowed, (4) continued attempts should be made to protect the children of the school district from settlements that detract from their educational opportunities, and (5) teachers should be made more aware of the budget process.

CBE is a program for certifying student performance that requires demonstration of an acceptable level of skill in those areas deemed vital to success in postgraduation life roles. This document examines some of the current problems with and suggests some tangible solutions for the keeping of records being generated by CBE requirements. Four problems are addressed: (1) reducing the recordkeeping workload of the teachers, (2) reducing the efforts of maintaining the records system, (3) increasing the useful information available from it, and (4) removing the need for human judgment by making the  recording and reporting more objective. Both manual and computer records systems are discussed. Sample forms are included for reader use. (Author/LD)",

The nationwide survey, conducted in the summer of 1978, had three objectives: to assess the degree of need for expanded or improved training opportunities in 14 areas, to indicate preferred methods for providing this training, and to evaluate current training methods according to relevance of course content and quality of instruction. The findings, which represent the views of school district superintendents, revealed that public school administrators perceive a need for expanded or improved training opportunities. Over half the districts felt the state inservice programs could provide the needed training, and they rated the current  training methods as adequate or better. However, a substantial number of districts called for major improvement in existing administrative training programs. (Author/LD)",

A sample of 335 students from various undergraduate and graduate business courses completed the Bem Sex-Role Inventory both for themselves and for a good manager. Three hypotheses were tested--that the good manager is perceived as androgynous in sex-role identification rather than as masculine, feminine, or undifferentiated; that the individuals' perceptions of a good manager are affected by their own sex-role identification; and that the effect of sex-role identification on individuals' perceptions of a good manager are independent of the effect of sex. The results indicated an overwhelming preference for a masculine manager.  Strong correspondence was observed between comparable self-scores and ideal-scores for both males and females. Data show that the effects of sex-role identification and sex on individuals' perceptions of a good manager are different: the effect of varying sex on individuals' ideal-group memberships was negligible, while the effect of varying self-group membership was considerable.

An introductory chapter, written by Dr. Gallup, reviews some of the major opinion trends revealed by the polls. For instance, in 9 of 10 surveys, discipline is cited more often than any other problem, followed by busing, financial concerns, and student drug use. Gallup recommends greater citizen participation in the educational  process. (Author/LD)",

The LEAs collected data on teacher and administrator shortages (number  sought but not hired because qualified candidates were unavailable) and on fields for which there is expected to be an emerging or growing demand for teachers or administrators from a sample of about 500 school districts.

These workshops generated a data bank of validated competency statements and related information and permitted an initial trial of an on-the-job assessment procedure. The Quadrant Assessment Model (QAM) was used by teams of administrators to analyze the interrelationships of their roles, pinpoint weaknesses in role specifications, identify role conflicts, and identify situation-specific competencies. Descriptive statements of competencies needed for community education had been generated, refined, and validated in an  earlier study. In this project it was determined whether or not those who perform as superintendents, principals, district coordinators, or building directors in community education districts could employ a competency statement to make judgments about the importance of a given competency to performance in the role, where the competency could best be attained, and the level of proficiency required in the competency. These determinations were used in developing the ideal profiles of needed competencies for the four specified roles. (Author/MLF)",

Since 1968, overall enrollments in the study of modern foreign languages have fallen, but enrollments in the &quot;needed&quot; languages, those supported by Title VI of the National Defense Education Act of 1958, have increased. During the last several years, the Congress has provided a stable level of Federal funding with slightly increasing levels to offset inflation. Federal managers have succeeded in making important improvements in the programs during the past several years, but additional administrative improvements are needed. General Accounting Office (GAO) recommends that the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare  require the Office of Education to: (1) visit at least once every 2 years each of the 80 centers at institutions of higher education receiving Title VI grants; (2) prepare and distribute to center officials and other appropriate parties a bi-annual report containing helpful &quot;lessons learned&quot; based on center reports and visits to centers; (3) provide feedback reports to the centers at least once a year on their reports to the Office of Education; and (4) develop a system to evaluate the effectiveness of the program providing starter grants to new international studies projects. It was discovered that program managers are faced with the problem of determining the national needs for the study of foreign languages and related areas. (SW)",

The conditions of the experiment were dialogues between an expert and an apprentice who were repairing an appliance. In the dialogues, three cases of indirect answers are distinguished: (1) the response, though indirect, answers the question asked; (2) the response denies a presupposition of the question; and (3) the answer responds to higher goals the questioner was trying to achieve. Detailed analysis of the dialogues shows that one needs knowledge about the task, the role of the participants, and communication goals in order to construct appropriate answers. As a result of  the investigations, it is proposed that an answer is appropriate if it provides some information that allows the questioner to achieve the goals he or she had in mind in asking the question.

        "author":["Kreidler, Charles W."],
        "description":"The reduction of existing lexical items to shorter forms has generally been discussed under the headings of \"acronyms,\"\"back-formations,\" and \"clippings.\" Two kinds of acronym are found, the letter-naming type (e.g. FBI, YMCA) and the letter-sounding type (e.g. UNESCO, CARE). The latter type must be pronounceable within the phonotactic norms of the language; thus it may coincide with an existing word, and sometimes the coincidence is favored for the semantic association. The term \"back-formation\" has been applied to instances in which an apparent suffix has been removed (e.g. edit from editor) and \"clipping\" to instances in which the matter removed is not a morpheme (e.g. gym from gymnasium). This paper suggests that such a distinction is not valid and uses the term \"clipping\"  for both. Clipping occurs mainly because people like to play with language and because language has redundant matter which can be deleted. On the phonological side, certain preferences are seen: (1) the clipped form is more likely to be from the beginning of the source form than from the end or middle; (2) it falls into one of a small number of patterns; and (3) it shows all the phonological constraints which exist for longer words. Grammatically and semantically, various innovations are possible: the clipped form may be identical in meaning and function with the source form, it may be more restricted, or it may have a broader meaning and/or a wider grammatical function.

SIE findings for persons of Hispanic origin who usually speak Spanish show that on these measures, this group is even more disadvantaged than language-minority persons in the aggregate. In addition to summaries of some of the findings, data are presented on the percentages of students two or more years behind expected age-grade levels by ethnic origin and language  characteristics and on the numbers and percentages of students age 6 to 20 in grades 1 to 12 who were below expected grade levels.

In a study undertaken to determine how these three factors interact, children aged 6 to 11 were asked to produce and recognize paraphrases. Results showed: (1) syntagmatic processing of sentences declined with age, while paradigmatic, paraphrastic processing increased; (2) the effect of imaginal similarity upon semantic processing also declined, but was present at all ages; (3) lexical factors were more salient than syntactic factors and developmentally affected processing strategies; younger children focused upon individual words and made lexical substitutions while older  children focused upon the entire set of content words in a sentence and made syntactic rearrangements; and (4) psycholinguistic demands affected information loss. Taken together, these findings integrate and extend previous developmental studies and studies of metalinguistics, and illustrate the Piagetian concept of decalage and the Brunerian concept of iconicity.

Remedial activities designed to address these problems are discussed. Twenty activities emphasize the development of analytical skills, nine activities concentrate on the synthesis of information, 17 activities concentrate on increasing flexibility with the language, and three activities address making inferences. These remedial activities are easily  adaptable to individual tutorial sessions, small-group work, or large-group instruction. In the latter case, teachers may choose to identify particular problems and incorporate appropriate activities into daily lesson plans. A grid is presented indicating appropriate remedial activities for each learner problem (e.g., poor memory) and each learning task (e.g., listening). (SW)",

Of particular interest were the extent to which language requirements and language training are included in corporate planning and the extent to which occupationally-oriented special purpose language training is included in the language training provided to corporate employees. Data were collected by means of a detailed  questionnaire sent to the U.S. headquarters of 267 American companies reported to be doing business abroad. Questionnaires were returned by 184 companies. Among the findings are the following: (1) the greatest amount of international business in which U.S. corporations are involved is currently being done in Western Europe, followed by Central and South America, Canada, the Middle East, and the Far East; (2) Spanish is the language most studied by U.S. nationals going abroad and also the language most involved in translation and interpreting; (3) U.S. corporations doing business abroad rely primarily on English as the business language and the means of communication; and (4) language training is provided to a majority of U.S. national employees going overseas and outranks technical,  cultural, and managerial training in type of training provided.

Teaching styles are defined as habitual, consistent patterns of preferred strategies used by teachers in promoting learning. The inventory covers strategies used in teaching pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary, reading, writing, culture and speaking. The frequency of teaching behaviors and strategies, based on a five-point scale, is assessed by the respondent. The inventory contains 13 items covering pronunciation, l6 items covering grammar, 13 items covering vocabulary, 21 items covering reading, 39 items  covering speaking, 30 items covering writing, and 18 items covering culture.

        "description":"This paper, part of a series of studies on higher education in different countries, traces the origins of higher education in Belgium to the 1970's. From 1835-1876, Belgium universities were shaped by polarization bewteen Catholics and liberals, uncertainty about the basic institutional patterns in higher education, and the legislative intrusion of the state in higher education. The Higher Education Law of 1876 inaugurated a withdrawal of the state from the affairs of the universities, and the challenge of German Science placed an emphasis on research and scholarship. From World War I to 1960, the importance of the Flemish language increased in the universities, the principle of state financing of the private universities was established, and the state universities progressively  won greater administrative autonomy from the state. The evolution and influence of higher technical education, the university expansion problem from 1960-65, the expulsion of the French from Louvain, the rebellion against the traditional university, and construction of the new order from 1969-71 are covered. Higher education enrollment stabilization in the 1970's, the difficulty of the first candidature, upgrading of technical education, the uncertainty of university-state relations, recurrent education, part-time university education, education for nontraditional students, and establishment of an open university are discussed.

        "description":"Part of a series of studies on higher education in different countries, this paper examines internal differentiation of Japanese higher education and the problem of coordination, using a comparative perspective. The crucial difference in the division of universities by subjects among different nations has been between chair and department organization. In Japan, both kinds of organization are found, but the chair structure has been the more important of the two. The Japanese tier structure has been more like the European mode than the American; there is no sharp distinction between undergraduate and graduate study as in the United States. Both Japan and the United States have a range of institutional types that have developed under private sponsorship as well as state authority.  Japan has numerous sectors and subsectors among its large population of 1,000 institutions. Japan has much institutional hierarchy in higher education; there is a vertical ladder of prestige ranking among the many sectors. For over a century, Japan has provided bureaucratic coordination of higher education in the form of a national ministry of education, and professors are also involved in coordination nationally as well as locally. Political influences on higher education have been exerted by political officials and to some extent by external groups, and the consumer market is extremely active in Japanese higher education.

        "description":"Part of a series of studies on higher education in different countries, this essay examines relations between universities and governments from a comparative perspective. Two major themes that appear in the literature are the determinants of increased government control and the extent of that power; six recent books that address these themes are discussed. The most frequently cited determinant of increased government control of universities is system expansion. Newer institutions generally lack the power of more established institutions (the size, tradition, or alumni), and proliferation increases the need for active coordination. Expansion has also changed intra-university structures in a way that stimulates government involvement. Demands that universities meet social,  economic, and political needs beyond the campus also affect government control. Government control over the university has increased as overall government control has increased in most socio-economic spheres. The extent of government control and patterns of control in different countries are examined. Centralized control; autonomy and academic freedom; the power of coordinating boards; and control over appointive, academic, and financial policies are considered. (SW)",

In 1975 at SUNY at Buffalo, each college interested in continuing was required to submit a charter. Four issues underlying chartering that were concerned with the compatibility of the colleges and universities are: organization and administration of the  colleges, character of the collegiate assembly, academic freedom, and academic quality of college courses. Formulating and planning of the institutionalization-termination of the innovation, approving a plan, and implementing the plan are discussed. Interpretations of applying the model at SUNY at Buffalo are provided.

        "description":"The present status and future projections for graduate education at the doctoral level are examined and recommendations for regionalization are presented in this speech. Among the topics discussed are the Ph.D. labor supply and demand, federal graduate programs, state response, and cost studies. Although the number of Ph.D.'s awarded annually has stabilized over the last five years, colleges and universities have been reluctant to prepare themselves for this and for projected declines in student enrollments. It is suggested that many programs may soon become victims of retrenchment if counter measures are not instituted. Decreases in federally funded graduate programs are also contributing to financial difficulties. A regional approach (incorporating several states) to  consolidate graduate education is recommended to make the programs more realistic in light of labor demands and more cost effective. The development of a national evaluation method for graduate programs, regional manpower studies, marketing research and an examination of Master's and external degree programs with a regional focus is urged.

Desegregation is viewed as a means of guaranteeing equal opportunity and equal attainment for black students. Although progress has been made, a continuing disparity between the percentage of blacks in the population and the percentage enrolled in public colleges and universities is evident with the greatest disparity apparent in professional schools. Problems that several states have experienced in meeting desegregation requirements are discussed and the goals and successes of desegregation are assessed. Student financial aid programs including the Basic Educational Opportunity Grants Program,  Supplementary Educational Opportunity Grants, the State Student Incentive Grant Program, College Work-Study, and the National Direct Student Loan Program are explained. Problems and recommended changes are presented for each program. Compensatory education programs (Upward Bound, Special Services, Talent Search, College Discovery and Development Program and Student Aid), defined as programs for disadvantaged students, focus on special services, student aid, professional employment, curriculum education, teacher training, research related to different cultures and library aid. Their goals, achievements and the impact they have had on higher education are discussed. Eighteen recommendations on the future direction of these programs are provided. (BH)",

The final outcome of the legislative process was the Middle Income Student Assistance Act (P.L. 95-566) that amends the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant Program and the Guaranteed  Student Loan Program to make them more accessible to middle-income students.

The nature of the dissemination capacity is reflected in goals of providing greater access to information resources for educators, and realization of increased coordination among activities of SEAs. Each SEA addresses these goals through activities in the areas of resources, linkage, and leadership. In 1976, the National Testing Service began the development of an evaluation design for the State Capacity Building Program. A technical assistance component to assist projects in applying information from the program evaluation, and to provide technical consultant services to help address project-identified needs was also established. Technical  assistance services provided are grouped into the categories of communication, leadership development activities, evaluation documentation, conceptual development, and ad hoc consultant assistance. Assessment of these technical assistance services indicates a de-emphasis of ad hoc services, more responsibility by project directors for their own leadership development, more attention to transformation activities aimed at bringing conceptual and theoretical material to the attention of project directors, and distinction between their needs and wants.

Not only is the cost of library materials going up at inflationary rates, but the population in the Trust Territory is becoming more educated, and the leadership is passing into the hands of young college trained people who will need special information for decision-making. A new political status which is only a few years away will serve to increase information needs. A consortium designed to supply information for those individuals who are actively involved in government administration, science and technology, and education and health, would need at least three components to  function: legal basis, funding basis, and programs. The organization, activities, and benefits are described for a U.S. consortium, which would consist of American Samoa, Guam, Trust Territory of the Pacific, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, and Hawaii. An alternative to formalizing an interlibrary consortium for the Pacific Basin would be for the Trust Territory to work closely with Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas in a Micronesian consortium, with a back-up resource center in Hawaii at either the university or the state library.

ACT systems can be valuable tools in listening groups, training, information dissemination in family planning, and as tools for field workers; and these systems enable the information receiver to control the listening situation.

Thirty-one pairs of principals and media specialists from public high schools responded to the Short Form Dogmatism Scale and a Rank Ordering Questionnaire assessing the relative importance of selected media specialist tasks. Results indicated there were main effect differences between principals and media specialists for instructional design and utilization, and between open and closed-minded respondents for awareness services.  Similarity of dogmatism scores of principal-media specialist pairs was related to similarity of rank ordering of media specialist tasks. It appears that principals and media specialists tend to rank the more traditional media specialist tasks as more important than the more progressive media specialist tasks, although media specialists tended to be somewhat more progressive. In addition, it appears that dogmatism, as a personality variable, may be a factor in influencing a professional relationship, especially during initial contacts. (Author/CMV)",

Four types of RITA agents are (1) an exemplary programing agent that watches a user perform an arbitrary series of operations on the computer and then writes a program (a new RITA agent) to perform the same task; (2) a self-modifying agent that performs ARPAnet file-transfer tasks for  the user, modifying itself so that each subsequent time it performs the task, it can do so with less help from the user; (3) a tutoring agent that watches an expert demonstrate the use of an interactive computer language or local operating system and then creates a teaching agent that can help naive users become familiar with the language or system demonstrated by the expert; and (4) a reactive-message creating agent that elicits text from a user (the sender) and uses it to create a new RITA agent which is a reactive message; the reactive message is then sent to some other user (the recipient), who interacts with it; and during the course of the interaction, a record of the recipient's responses is sent back to the sender.

Activities reported include preparations for the White House Conference on Library and Information Services (Public Law 93-568) as well as the ongoing implementation of the Commission's National Program. Final reports were obtained from three studies undertaken earlier: Inventory of Library Needs--1975; Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Federal Funding of Public Libraries; and Library Photocopying in the United States. The Task Force on a National Periodicals System completed its work with a report: Effective Access to the Periodical Literature, and three more task forces were constituted to work computer  protocols, standards in the library and documentation fields, and the role of the school library/media center in the National Program. Continuing activities included support for the Committee for the Coordination of National Bibliographic Control; communication, coordination, and cooperation with other government agencies and the professional community; and keeping abreast of developments in the area of copyright. All of these activities, and others, as well as plans for the future and recommendations for the following year, are discussed in this report. (Author/JVP)",

A live lecturer presenting subject overviews to large audiences, small student-centered discussion groups, and varied instructional media will enhance achievement levels of students being taught to use college libraries. Behavioral objectives might be used to improve achievement in library learning although it is less certain how they might improve instruction and the evaluation of learning. There is slight evidence to support inferences regarding cognitive knowledge retention, and none regarding the transfer of knowledge from use of one library  tool to another. Sufficient information about the transfer of theoretical textbook knowledge to practical in-library use is also lacking. In-house media have been reported efficient only on a long term basis; therefore, library instruction programs, especially experimental ones, could benefit from use of commercially produced media for learning standard tools.

As a result they lack the staff, materials, space, and hours of service to meet citizens' needs. To bring the libraries up to minimum levels of service will require a one-time expenditure of $12 billion for books and other materials and an increase of $6 billion a year for operating budgets (based on 1974 costs). These conclusions are supported by charts showing the deficiencies in professional staff; books, print, and microform materials; nonprint materials; and annual operating budgets.

The program uses simple sequences of instructions and explanations followed by questions. Branching is employed to advance students who answer correctly to the next unit of instruction, or to send those who respond incorrectly to remedial questions. While remedial instruction has to be kept at a minimum because of the memory limitations imposed by the college's IBM 370-135 computing system, a special feature does allow students to repeat missed material. Software limitations also prevented automatic graphic presentation of instructional materials, and  a manual was developed to accompany the program. Despite its limitations, the program has been highly rated by librarians, library science majors, and undergraduate students at the college and from other institutions. The basic units include a general introduction, drawer arrangement, guide cards, types of catalog cards, catalog card format, information found on a catalog card, filing rules, and subject headings. Sample pages from the program guide, the evaluation questionnaire, and an analysis of evaluation data are attached. (BBM)",

A representative sample of seven papers was presented at a one-day COMIT Symposium, some accompanied by videotaped demonstrations that illustrated the teaching techniques used. In order to provide as complete a record of the project as possible, all 12 of the papers from participants are included in this volume (grouped, where possible, by subject), as well  as comments by the project director and the coordinator from IBM and a summary of the pedagogical lessons learned from COMIT. Courses described include environmental engineering, survey design, advanced calculus, organic synthesis, biology, human movement, ice hockey practice, football, leisure experience, history of art, and English.

        "description":"Attitudes and attitude measurement are critical components of teaching and learning and the instructional developer should collect as much relevant data about that process as possible. It is important for instructional developers to study the attitudes of learners in order to demonstrate attitude/achievement relationships, promote attitudinal position, reduce attitudinal influence, and to assess the impact of specific instruction. Attitude measurement should be valid, reliable, replicable, and fairly simple to administer, explain, and understand. Categories for collecting attitude information include self-reports, reports of others, sociometric procedures, and records. To insure effective attitude measurement, one must identify the construct to be measured and find an instrument  that will measure the relevant construct. If no existing measure is available, the instructional developer will need to construct his/her own test, recognizing the critical importance of reliability and validity of information. A pilot study should be conducted in order to revise tests for actual use. When testing is completed, resulting data must be summarized, analyzed, and displayed for the consumer. A bibliography and examples of the measurement process are included. (CWM)",

The overall goal of the NPC is to improve access to periodical literature for libraries and thus to individuals using libraries (1) by providing an efficient, reliable, and responsive document delivery system for periodical literature, (2) by establishing effective working relationships with the publishing community, and (3) by helping to shape a national library system through its operating policies and procedures. Means of achieving these objectives are discussed in  chapters focusing on specific issues: access to NPC, NPC-publishing community relationship, collection development, referral system, delivery, technical aspects (preservation, reprographics, collections storage and retrieval, communications, bibliographic control, technical processing, and systems development), site considerations, governance, and management. An implementation plan is also provided. Appendices include an estimate of request traffic, additional communications details, data-processing considerations, estimated load factors, full-time equivalent staffing levels by year, and a bibliography.

The first level report, which addresses ERIC as an information network, proposes two changes which would provide greater coordination and cohesion for the system--the development of a more hierarchical network articulation of the ERIC system, and a systematic reporting system a part of a more formal management information system. This report describes a framework for comprehending, examining, and managing the ERIC system; describes ueful data categories and appropriate levels of data collection; suggests a method of developing a  model data collecting system; and examines these suggestions with present possibilities. The second level report recommends non-experimental approaches to ERIC use assessments and examines methodological and research design considerations for ERIC usage studies. The third level report focuses on ERIC impact studies, i.e., how ERIC products and services have affected the end-user. General methodological recommendations are made for particular studies, and all available ERIC impact studies are analyzed in terms of these recommendations, and in terms of the specific impact measures employed. Research plans for future impact studies are included. (CWM)",

A random sample of 500 students enrolled for the winter 1978 term was selected to participate and a response rate of 46.4% was realized. Generally, the three highest areas of expressed need were college transfer information, job information, and selecting courses. The three lowest areas of expressed need were drug and alcohol counseling, drug and alcohol information, and family counseling. All areas mentioned were rated by the majority of respondents as \"important\" or \"very  important,\" regardless of whether the individual felt he or she needed help in that area. Thus, knowing that the service existed was important. The study revealed that, in general, evening and off-campus students, though often expressing greater advisement needs, were less aware of how to obtain help than day students. The specific results are presented in tabular form by total group and by campus of attendance. The survey instrument is appended. (Author/MB)",

From the 830 employers who had 50 or more employees, a stratified random sample of 400 employers responded to questionnaire interviews. Variables studied included: geographical area, company type (occupational category), employee qualities, types of positions or job categories (current numbers employed in each and one-, two-, and five-year projections), recruitment, current training, identified training  needs, incentives, interest in training programs, employment of handicapped, and affirmative action plans. Findings indicated numerous training needs, primarily in the medical and industrial fields. Many of the programs currently offered needed to focus on job-entry competencies, and in other areas supplemental training was needed to upgrade and/or retrain present employees. In still other areas, no training was available. A literature review and survey methodology are discussed. Appendices contain the questionnaire and other occupational information. (Author/MB)",

The ICCB supports counseling as a full partner, with instruction, in the educational development of students, and acknowledges the following professional activities as part of a comprehensive counseling program: (1) individual and goal counseling related to educational and career goals of the student; (2) academic advising; (3) human development instruction (curricular and/or co-curricular); (4) consultation and collaboration with students and faculty; (5) interest,  ability, and needs assessment; and (6) appropriate referrals. Additionally, the ICCB emphasizes that counseling must be evaluated and provides guidelines for the evaluation of career planning and placement, of counseling, of academic advisement, and of student assessment and academic placement. The guidelines are expressed in terms of the purpose and goals of each of these processes, and include definitions of components and questions to be used to assess achievement of goals. (AYC)",

Subsequent follow-up studies of 37 kindergarten and 20 first grade children with the EORP-SB showed that at first grade a new set of behaviors emerged among program graduates, and that preschool program gains which remained evident in the kindergarten sample were declining among first grade program graduates. In particular, program children  in preschool and kindergarten smiled and laughed more than their matches, while in first grade the contrast group smiled more. Further, the first grade children who were program graduates seemed to seek adult attention in negative as well as positive ways. It is concluded that the transition between preschool program teacher interaction styles and elementary school classroom conditions may be too stressful for many young children, particularly for children from at-risk families. Institutional changes may be necessary if preschool enrichment program gains are to be maintained. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"This paper reviews the rights of children as defined by the Constitution of the United States and summarizes a series of Supreme Court decisions which have defined the protections afforded to children by the Constitution. A short historical overview of the legal status of children is provided as background for the report. It is suggested that the determination of children's rights is complicated by litigation holding that the interests of parents in guiding and directing their minor children are also protected by the Constitution. Most of the recent Supreme Court decisions, however, have dealt with the power of the government as it affects the rights of children and their parents. These decisions suggest that children in juvenile delinquency proceedings are granted considerable  due process and that students are to enjoy freedom of speech and press as long as the educational process is not disturbed. Decisions regarding school disciplinary actions, however, are less consistent. Current litigation involving areas such as abortion, contraception, and institutionalization will help to clarify children's rights in cases involving parent-child conflicts. In analyzing the future of children's rights litigation, the government's greater authority over children in comparison with adults, is emphasized. The paper suggests that children's rights cases will continue to be decided on an issue-by-issue basis rather than through a more unified or synthesized approach. (BD)",

The infant was 12 months old at the onset of the study and 16 months when the testing was completed. Each subject was videotaped for seven minutes in a room which contained the infant and infant toys as well as books and magazines appropriate to the age level of the subject. The instructions indicated to the subjects that the infant's interactions with others were being studied and that the subjects were free to choose whether or not to interact with him. Subject behaviors in the categories of proximity behaviors, vocalizations, and play were time-sampled from the resulting  videotapes. Results indicated significant sex and age differences in the frequency of nurturant behaviors. In general, males and preschoolers interacted less with the infant than did females and subjects in the older age groups. Consistent sex differences were found at all three age levels. (Author/BD)",

The controversy over public vs. private control of early childhood education is discussed. The position of the American Federation of Teachers is advocated. It is concluded that only if the government is willing to make a major change in social policy will it be possible to avoid having inadequate and limited child care develop into a problem of catastrophic proportions. A major recommendation is that  public schools act as coordinators for all children's services. (Author/RH)",

Main supporting reasons are: schools are available throughout the country; school systems have become adept at administering large, complicated federal programs; public schools are better equipped to contribute to the intellectual development of young children; utilization of existing schools is more efficient; schools can better coordinate services; use of educational agency licensing mechanisms will upgrade early childhood education staffs; public control promotes accountability; there is presently a lack of high  program quality and adherence to licensing standards; and overlapping jurisdiction complicates assessment and evaluation.

        "description":"Declining school enrollment, the surplus of qualified teachers and the existence of unused school buildings are among the reasons given for advocating public school sponsorship of expanded early childhood education and day care. Additionally, the number of women who work and need child care services is growing. The gap between the number of preschoolers now receiving service and the number whose parents may want it may be 6 million children. Present child care centers are largely inadequate in terms of availability, standards, and staff qualifications. There are today 60 or more federal programs that contribute to the funding of early childhood and day care programs. Coordinating efforts of the Office of Child Development are weakened by the absence of local administrative  authority to organize funding. Federal spending for day care has increased significantly but in a pattern calculated to reinforce an already segregated system of services: public day care for the poor and private nursery schools or child care centers for the affluent. Though Head Start marks the beginning of a willingness to think about day care in terms of educational programs, the divided thinking which categorizes day care as custodial, and preschool and kindergarten programs as educational, still exists. Day care and preschool education should be combined and made universally available to all children. The public schools should be the prime sponsors of child care programs. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"This research explored the development of reasoning about persuasion. First-grade, seventh-grade, and undergraduate subjects were individually presented with a hypothetical persuasive situation in which a young child attempts to obtain a toy from various &quot;targets.&quot; Pairs of tape-recorded persuasive appeals were randomly presented to each subject; for each pair, subjects were asked to identify which strategy the &quot;persuader&quot; would select, and to justify this choice. The major results pertained to the subjects' justifications for their strategy choices. As predicted, there were significant increases in the number of reasons provided, in the use of reasons involving inferences about others' psychological states, and in the number of hypothetical, qualifying statements used. In  contrast to these age trends, the strategy-choice data revealed that even the youngest subjects selected reasoned, elaborated strategies that took account of the target's internal states. These children also engaged in target differentiation, as did the older subjects. A follow-up study was undertaken; its results in general provided strong support for the above findings. Taken together, results are consistent with theory and previous research findings regarding the relationship of role taking to persuasion development. However, the data also suggest that even young children have a rudimentary understanding of strategic persuasion, despite the fact that their role-taking skills are relatively undeveloped. (Author)",

Matched groups of twenty 10-year-olds were selected from a rural Appalachian community, a middle-class suburban community, and a lower-middle-class urban community, and administered a Piaget-based map drawing task. Twenty separate elements, each of which is a spatial concept applied to a map feature, were assessed for developmental level (1-6). The element scores were partitioned by individual spatial concepts, feature clusters, modal levels, and mean map drawing averages. Analyses of variance were performed on the partitioned scores to compare the groups' developmental levels. Scheffe tests for determining all possible comparisons were then  performed on the partitioned scores reaching significance between the groups. Results showed that the suburban and urban groups did not differ on any of the elements of the task, and that the Appalachian children performed better than both groups on all elements. These findings support research that has demonstrated environmental influences on cognitive development. This has been interpreted as evidence that urban/suburban environments in the U.S. are not optimal for the development of all cognitive skills. (Author/MP)",

Multidisciplinary teams consisting of a minimum of one nurse, social worker, home educator, and secretary per site provided individualized early education activities, developmental screening, in-home counseling for social services, referrals, nutrition counseling and parent education to project families on a weekly or biweekly basis. Well-child  clinics were also held each week. The evaluation of CHDP was carried out by the University of Tennessee's Bureau of Educational Research. The evaluation included a comparison over a 6-month period of newly entering CHDP families and control group families, a review of the records of 20 families who had been receiving CHDP services for approximately 18 months, an assessment of community attitudes towards the project, and measures of staff morale and staff opinions on the effectiveness of project management. Results in each area generally indicated successful achievement of most CHDP goals for both parents and children. (BD)",

By 1970 the proportion of the U.S. population residing on farms had fallen to about 5 per cent, and by 1977 had dropped to 3.6 per cent. About 1.4 per cent of the farm population was of Spanish origin (represented for the first time in this year's report), as compared to 5.4 per cent of the nonfarm population. The farm population had a higher proportion White than the nonfarm population and a lower proportion Black. In 1977 the median age of farm residents was 35.2 years, as compared with 29.1 years for nonfarm residents. The farm population had a higher proportion of persons 55 years and over than the nonfarm population, and a slightly lower proportion of children under age 14. Farm families were more  likely than nonfarm families to be of the married-couple type, and were less likely to be maintained by women. Although a lower proportion of farm families had own children under 18 present (because of the older age structure of the farm population), those who did have children tended to have a larger number than corresponding nonfarm families. Both the South and combined North and West regions evidenced an increase in the proportion of the farm resident labor force engaged in nonagricultural pursuits. The median income of farm families continued to lag behind that of nonfarm families. (BR)",

This manual, written by and for Indians, can be used for implementation of reservation industrial development. After a review of the circumstances that create the economic development environment unique to the Indian context, the planning process is discussed as it is applied to the comprehensive socio-economic development of a reservation. A plan for organizing the physical group to carry out the economic development program is offered along with ways the program itself may be organized for most effective operation. Sources of financial assistance to American Indian  reservations are listed. Strategies for attracting potential industries to the reservation are given as well as techniques and procedures to be utilized when working with prospects. Discussion is also devoted to such needs as: establishing confirmed industrial development sites; solidifying industry already existing on the reservation; and promoting the industrial development program on three levels to the members of the tribe, to the tribal council, and to potential capital investors. The final chapter discusses economic development implications and opportunities for the Alaska Native population. (DS)",

        "description":"Effective time and resource management is a necessity in all schools, particularly in small schools which make so many kinds of demands on each staff member. To successfully meet the challenge of providing a quality education in a small school, every available resource should be used, the staff and community surveyed to determine special skills or interests that can be shared with students, and communication lines developed and maintained among staff, students, administration and community. This document is a collection of materials by practitioners on managing time and resources. The first section, which is devoted to time management, presents papers on time management for administrators and teacher-managers, team management, time management in the elementary school, student  scheduling, and independent study. The section on resource management deals with people management, community schools, group guide counseling, volunteer aides, facility development, planning, curriculum review and change, the relationship of the brain/mind and implications for education, and implementing Public Law 94-142. Also discussed are career education, media skills for K-12, music, using the newspaper as a resource, reading for slow learners, science fun, social studies as one of the basics, and writing (composition) improvement techniques. Most of the chapters in this document are edited from presentations made at a 1978 small schools summer institute at Willamette University in Salem, Oregon. (Author/DS)",

Concerning the preparation of low-income women for work, Section III contains a practical solution to their poverty problems. The Aid to Families with Dependent Children program is used to delineate the money wasted in current programs for low-income women and the resultant low level of benefits to the recipients.

        "description":"Twenty five urban centers, 70 Indian tribes, and 60 public television stations responded to questionnaires in an attempt to collect information useful to the process of making programmatic decisions about future goals and activities of the Native American Public Broadcasting Consortium (NAPBC). The Tribal and Urban Center questionnaires were concerned with facilities, information sources, media involvement, media equipment, and programming preferences of respondents. Radio and television were generally available to tribes and populations served by urban centers, and educational television was the preferred source of information. Most respondents in both categories wanted a trained media specialist available or on staff. Culture, history, survival skills, employment, economics,  and developing a positive self-image were seen as important program topics. Of the responding public television stations, only about 25% had 5 to 10 hours of Native American programming per year, despite having Native American audiences. Lack of money and knowledge prevented production of such special interest programs. Indian culture, arts, and social issues were topics perceived as interesting to Native American viewers. Overall, top priority Native American media needs were determined to be programming, training, and information delivery systems. The questionnaires are included with complete data tabulations for each. (SB)",

        "description":"Comprehension of the current condition of rural education is essential to national education policy and program considerations, yet rural schools go unnoticed at the federal level because of a paucity of national rural data. The changing nature of rural population, the national mandate for equal educational opportunity, and the need for a timely concept of rural development are all justifications for an expanded rural education data base. The data base should include information on student populations, the schools and school staff characteristics, and educational finance. This information should be gathered via: periodic studies of the status of rural education at the local, regional, and national level; analytic synthesis of work on many topics affecting rural students; and the  routine inclusion of rural schools and students in all major congressionally mandated studies. Descriptions of 12 federal information sources--such as the Departments of HEW, Labor, and Agriculture, the Bureau of the Census, and the General Accounting Office--stress the particular strengths and weaknesses of those sources and emphasize that no one governmental source has all the information on rural education. The agency descriptions serve much as an annotated bibliography for the information seeker. Recommendations include providing for systematic collection of rural data, merging of agency data, and creating a National Center for Rural Education Studies. (SB)",

        "description":"Since Fall of 1973, the population of Oglala Sioux Community College has remained fairly constant, averaging 339 students in the fall and 380 in the spring. In Spring, 1978, 64 percent of the student body attended part time, with an average of 68 percent being female. Although the number of graduates has increased from 7 in 1974 to 24 in 1978, the retention rate has dropped from 76 percent in 1975 to 57 percent. Enrollment is strongly influenced by local employment patterns. Government, state, and tribal programs cause sudden changes in enrollment when they require employees to take classes. Availability of financial aid programs and employers' support of their employees taking college courses are also influences. Because of the shifts in both the financial aid programs and the  employment training picture, enrollment projection is difficult. Many young people leave the reservation and no large college age population boom can be predicted. Based on projected reservation growth, however, student enrollment should be 386 in 1980-81 and 406 in 1983-84. Protection from unexpected enrollment fluctuations can be provided by working closer with employers, providing courses to compliment federal programs, and directing recruiting efforts at both high school counselors and students.

        "description":"To further an explanation of the post-1970 United States demographic phenomenon of increased population for non-metropolitan areas, the relationship of 3 ecological phenomena to non-metropolitan net migration rates between the 1960's and the 1970's is examined for a random stratified sample of 380 United States non-metropolitan counties (primarily using U.S. Department of Agriculture data). The ecological phenomena studied as possible explanations of the change are: sustenance organization, including overall functional specialization and employment change; change in the age structure, especially the population in the highly mobile &quot;young adult&quot; years; and &quot;spillover&quot;, the expansion of metropolitan population and activities into non-metropolitan areas. Findings support existing  literature and indicate that changes in the overall number of employment opportunities, changes in specialization of sustenance organization, and sustenance activity in all categories but mining are not significantly related to net migration change. There is, however, a significant link between net non-metropolitan migration change and change in age structure of non-metropolitan populations as well as metropolitan &quot;spillover&quot;. Therefore, gains in net migration rates of non-metropolitan counties in the 1970's do not signal the development of new population redistribution mechanisms; rather, they can be viewed as a result of the continued operation of traditional processes.

To appeal to a wider market, publishers often produce materials favoring the interests of the predominant society. Thus, textbooks and other curricular materials too often portray Indian people and institutions in an inaccurate, limited, and unfair manner, thus perpetuating a distorted historical view. Indian youth and adults must attempt to eradicate such historical and cultural misinformation and bias in instructional materials. One way in which unsatisfactory instructional materials can be identified is through the use of the Project MEDIA evaluation catalog developed by the  National Indian Education Association. Community members can also identify and evaluate materials by asking specific questions such as &quot;Does the material generate a pride of heritage in Indian students?&quot;, and by obtaining Indian students' reactions to the materials. Comprehensive and well-organized requests for curriculum material removal should be presented to appropriate school decision makers and authorities, which differ with the type of school involved. The many Indian and non-Indian organizations involved in efforts to improve the education of Indian children can assist in such efforts. An alphabetical list of such organizations is included. (SB)",

        "description":"As many disciplines as possible should be used in the teaching of Indian Studies. In particular, creative literature adds another dimension to the understanding of Indian culture and the history of Indian-white relations when it is used in conjunction with historical and anthropological material. The serious student should read historical novels because they communicate an understanding of Indians as human beings and an appreciation for Indian culture, and they fill the gap left by the Indians' lack of written language. For example, there are available fine anthropological and historical overviews of Apache life. However, historical novels such as Well Comfort's &quot;Apache&quot;, Elliott Arnold's &quot;Blood Brother&quot; and &quot;Camp Grant Massacre&quot;, and James Olson's &quot;Ulzana&quot;, which have resulted  from long research and study and contain much accurate information on Apache culture and history, can serve as excellent supplements to more standard instructional material. In general, the historical novel can provide insight, understanding, and a third dimension to anthropology and history by providing points of reference, giving specific examples, establishing integrity by portraying reality, providing synthesis, serving as a source of motivation, aiding the interpretation of controversial subjects, expanding the audience of Indian history, and stimulating research.

For each country, data have been stored on 24 variables, such as use and production of energy, per/capita income, energy reserves, and so on. Using the computer program, students are guided through a series of inquiries into the data base. The data base may be expanded by the teacher. These materials are designed for grades 9 through 14 and are appropriate for Social Studies and Environmental Education or Science courses. This teacher's  guide presents: (1) an introduction to the unit; (2) background information on the program and how to use it; (3) student exercises; (4) information sources; and (5) program listing.

A global perspective is interpreted to include heightened awareness and understanding of the global system as well as increased consciousness of the intimate relationship of self, humankind, and the biosphere. The document, arranged in 13 sections, presents examples of global perspectives. Two sections examine the relationship of global perspectives to global citizenship and explore the role of the school in teaching global perspectives. Other sections focus on developing global curriculum, financing programs, measuring student progress, incorporating global perspectives into science and language arts programs, and providing  global education resources. Information is included on the importance and practicality of global perspectives education in precollegiate education, ways to encourage a global outlook without fostering political integration, contributions of tourism and international sport competitions to a global outlook, developing lesson plans with a global perspective, incorporating global content into reading lessons, and encouraging teacher involvement in global issues.

It also investigates the proposition that attitudes toward women officeholders are affected by the number of women serving together on the local municipal council. Fifty female and 50 male politicians from towns and cities in Connecticut were interviewed. Perceptions of women's roles were divided into four categories: equal opportunity for women in public office, social integration of women politicians, personality differences between men and women politicians, and representation of a female constituency by women in public office. As expected, sex differences were evident on all four dimensions. For example, in terms of equal opportunity for women, men were far less likely than women to believe women  were subjected to discriminatory treatment on the basis of sex. In terms of personality traits, women officials were regarded as &quot;usually more idealistic&quot; than men, and men were perceived to be &quot;better suited emotionally&quot; for political activities. Factor analysis of the responses showed that men's and women's attitudes were not correlated with the number of women serving together on the local political council. (AV)",

Pollutants which are uncontrolled and which are increasingly recognized as dangerous include carbon dioxide, toxic substances such as dioxin, mirex, lindane, mercuric oxide, lead and mercury, and nuclear wastes. Reasons for lack of success in removing these and other pollutants include the following: (1) pollution control efforts have gone into solving those problems which appeared most solvable, (2) more public expenditures have been aimed at correcting problems which have technical solutions, and (3) some important pollutants cannot be controlled by any known technologies. Analysis of data  regarding pollutants indicates that uncontrolled pollution exacts real costs on health and property and that cost-effective investment in abatement equipment can yield measurable net benefits. The conclusion is that controlling pollutants will require fundamental changes in life-styles and common business practices. (Author/DB)",

The projects include a term paper, book critique, independent research project, audio and/or visual demonstration, research assistance to a faculty member, and a community service option. The most popular of these projects is the community service option which is selected by 31% of the students. The project consists of working as a volunteer for 30 to 40 hours in a pre-authorized community service agency. Data are collected by students and faculty members about agencies in the Houston area such as churches, schools, hospitals, rehabilitation clinics, and halfway houses. Fact sheets are compiled for each agency including address, telephone, contact person  within the agency and at the University of Houston, status of the volunteer program, volunteer activities, and nature of the population which the agency serves. Student activities within the agency are supervised and evaluated by an agency representative. At the end of the course, students are asked to evaluate agency activities and goal achievement. Evaluations of the volunteer program indicate that it increases student understanding of the job market, links abstractions of the classroom with the reality of activity in a community agency, and offers significant volunteer services to agencies which are often in need of qualified volunteers.

Teaching candidates enrolled in a generic teaching methods course constituted the sample. Nearly half of the participants were concurrently enrolled in student teaching which began six weeks into the semester as a full day-full time experience. The remaining subjects were enrolled in one of two conventionally scheduled courses that met for the entire semester for three one-hour sessions per week. The beginning and conclusion of this study was signaled by the administration of a higher order cognitive achievement test. Treatment variation  with respect to remediation strategies for mastery learning occurred after the formative test was administered for each unit. The significant finding in this investigation suggests that compressing the curriculum experiences into a time period that decreases the number of days, but not the actual class hours devoted to curriculum components, reduces performance with respect to higher order cognitive skills.

A survey of related research and literature provided the fabric for development of the survey questionnaire. Four points at which decisions regarding selection and retention are traditionally made were apparent: admission to the teacher education program; retention in the teacher education program; graduation from the program; and certification or licensure to teach. Instruments and procedures utilized included: self-report questionnaires; biographical forms; tests of aptitude and knowledge; school grades; structured interviews; measure of values, attitudes, and personality  characteristics; and letters of reference. Appended to this report are the instruments used for the survey. (JD)",

Results indicated that teachers who had received participation training preferred less participation in decision-making when there was disagreement among them than when there was agreement, and tended to believe that participation would be less effective when there was disagreement. On more important decisions, untrained teachers preferred more participation when there was disagreement than when there was agreement, and rated participation as more likely to achieve effective decisions when there was disagreement. Implications of the results for  contingency models of participation and for participation training are discussed. (Author)",

The questionnaire was developed to be a screening instrument for use by mental health professionals for the early detection of children's behavior problems. The scale was standardized on a group of preschoolers aged three to six, including male and female and black and white children. The PBQ is a modification of an English checklist with additional questions from a variety of sources. Significant differences were found between mean scores for 496 children from preschools for the general public and 102 preschoolers in programs specifically for emotionally disturbed children. A factor analysis of the 36 items yielded a three factor solution. The factors were labeled: (1)  Hostile-Aggressive; (2) Anxious-Fearful; and (3) Hyperactive-Distractable. After analysis the questionnaire was shortened to 30 items. Males scored higher than females and blacks scored higher than whites. Administration and scoring are described and norms are given. It is recommended that any child scoring above the 90th percentile on the total or on any of the three subscores should be considered for further examination. (Author/CTM)",

Activities were considered problematic if their completion required more time, money or professional expertise than anticipated, or did not conform to procedures specified in the Guidelines. Activities frequently cited as problems were: (1) obtaining a reasonable response rate for the community survey; (2) identifying goals; (3) determining sub-goals; and (4) preparing the survey instrument. Despite the fact  that districts had access to consultants, state grants to cover costs, and Guidelines, the needs assessment was difficult, expensive, and time consuming.

        "description":"The College Level Examination Program (CLEP) had a substantial impact upon the Florida State University System. Over 42% of the beginning freshmen in 1972 took CLEP examinations and over 38% received credit for passing one or more examinations with a score above the national 50th percentile. These freshmen received an average of 27 quarter-hours credit. A comparison was made of a group of 870 students who had taken CLEP and a group of 424 other students matched according to Florida Twelfth Grade Test scores. The two groups were found to have similar grade point averages and to have carried the same number of credit hours, but 66 students (15%) of the CLEP group graduated in 3 years whereas only one of the other group had. Also, a larger percent of the other group withdrew before  graduation. Students who received credit for CLEP were less likely to experience academic difficulties then were those who took CLEP examinations but did not receive credit. The author concluded that the 50th percentile was a liberal cutoff score for University of Florida students; the CLEP examinations identified a group of highly motivated students; and CLEP credit alone did not insure an accelerated graduation date.

Most of the studies focused on either concurrent or predicitve validity in a military training situation. Evaluation criteria included leadership potential, promotion potential, personality traits, and supervisory skills. Substantial validity was generally found, with correlation coefficients in the .30 to .50 range. Reliability and validity of different evaluation methods (rating, ranking, nominations, and combinations of these techniques) did not vary substantially. Evaluation methods did, however, differ in feasibility and acceptability, the latter largely a function of familiarity with the evaluation procedure and perceived difficulty. Situational factors have  documented and potential effects which developers and users of peer evaluation should recognize. These factors include group size, informal group structure, demographic characteristics, group boundaries, hierarchical characteristics, friendship, length of association, and types of interaction. Although many issues surrounding peer evaluation or associate evaluation remain unresolved, evidence suggests they are a powerful tool in discriminating complex human behavior. (Author/CP)",

Several cautions surface from a review of the literature. First, tests that are based on program objectives are most useful to evaluations. Such objectives-based or criterion referenced tests often must be created by the evaluation staff, but test construction is difficult, lengthy, and costly. Second, goals or objectives themselves must be evaluated before program planning. Third, program design should be described in detail and fourth, consumers should know how to select qualified evaluators. Empirical cost data were collected on completed evaluations whose  budgets ranged from $400 to $3 million. The data were studied to obtain estimates of costs expected in relation to sample size, number of schools involved, number of test items developed and used, report length, and project staff time. Although a more thorough investigation is needed, these preliminary results should furnish a basis for estimating the cost of a proposed evaluation or determining how much evaluation can be done for x amount of dollars.

        "description":"An evaluation of TICCIT (Time-shared Interactive, Computer-controlled, Information Television) involved over 5,000 community college students in introductory algebra and English composition courses. Comparisons between computer-assisted instruction and lecture-discussion sections of the same courses focused on four aspects of student performance: course completion rates, achievement, attitudes, and activities (time allocation). Other evaluation questions focused on teacher attitudes, teacher role, and program implementation; including administration, site management, and courseware design goals. It was decided to construct objective and essay tests specifically for this program, to measure both end-of-course achievement and immediate learning. TICCIT had a significant positive  impact on achievement. The dramatic decreases noted in course completion rates may be inherent in self-paced instruction because students who have trouble managing their own instruction are risks. Student attitudes towards TICCIT were often less favorable than toward conventional teaching methods, but attitudes improved when TICCIT couses were supplemented by small group discussion with an instructor. Results suggest that TICCIT may be inappropriate for community colleges since only those students with a strong initial grasp in the subject matter benefited substantially. In itself, computer assisted instruction is no panacea; results depend on factors involved in the instructional process. (CP)",

Many parties were involved within the school district and in the community. Frequently, one or more parties blamed other parties for creating the problem. Directors of each of the five service components in Philadelphia's Office of Research and Evaluation prepared statements detailing the impact of budget restrictions, particularly staff layoff, on their respective divisions. The five components are: administrative and survey research, testing, federal evaluation, priority operations, and instructional research and development. Directors reported that the main effects of the budget crisis were low morale, unfulfilled potential, and  interruption of program evaluations and report production. Recognizing that the budget crisis is a perennial problem, the Small Project Assessment Service was initiated to provide directors of projects with limited funds and with technical expertise from the Office of Research and Evaluation. While the Service needs some revision, the concept is a good one--especially in financially troubled times. (CP)",

The program consisted of 100 televised lessons and booklets, and was given to 237 preschool children. The lessons presented &quot;games&quot; which were designed to develop cognitive concepts and skills. Both process and outcome evaluations were made. Process evaluations assessed whether televised portions and booklet distributions were implemented according to plan. Booklets were distributed as intended but several factors affected availability of the televised component. Outcome evaluations focused on the program's effect on children's learning readiness, attitudes, and skills, and on parent-child interactions in home-based and preschool enter-based studies. The results of the home-based  study indicated that parents felt children learned from the programs, but the center based study offered no support for program effects on children's learning readiness skills. Constraints on the program were discussed and several recommendations were offered. (Author/RD)",

The items were classified according to five verbal relations: synonyms, antonyms, functional, linear ordering, and class membership. A new method of componential analysis that does not require precueing was used to investigate predictive efficiencies of the six processes. Response latencies and error rates were analyzed. Analogical reasoning ability was found to improve with grade level, and subsets of the theory successfully accounted for response latency and error data at various grade levels. Mapping and application were important variables in grades 3 and 6; encoding and index of association for the stem were the most important processes in  ninth grade and undergraduate subjects. Performance also varied with type of verbal relation of the item. Functional and antonymous relations were easier to process than linear ordering, synonymous, and category name relations. The new method of breaking down component processes was found to be as successful as precueing at the adult level (the only level at which precueing has been used). Implications for intelligence testing are discussed. (Author/RD)",

Two studies investigated the psychometric properties of the DAS and the relationship between cognition and affect in 300 normal graduate students and teachers. The first study examined internal consistency, test - retest reliability and correlation with the Beck Depression Inventory, the Profile of Moods States, and A Measure of Cognitive Distortions in Depression (hypothetical stories). In the second study, the original 100-item DAS was shortened by factor analysis to two 40-item parallel forms. The reliability of the two forms was confirmed, suggesting that future  studies use the short rather than the 100-item version. In conclusion, preliminary findings indicated that negative cognitions are associated with depressed moods; furthermore, negative beliefs are more persistent than negative affect.

        "description":"A fundamental fact of the analysis of variance statistical procedure is that if the omnibus F test of an effect is significant, then there exists at least one contrast of that effect that will be significantly different from zero according to the S-method of Scheffe. The caveat to this rule is that the significant contrast(s) may not be of any interest to or interpretable by the investigator. Frustration does arise when the investigator determines the omnibus F test to be significant and then fails to find any meaningful group comparisons to be significant. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the coefficients of a contrast which will yield the largest test statistic according to the S-method. Then according to the fundamental theorem, this contrast will be significantly  different from zero and, additionally, should offer the investigator some assistance in developing a parsimonious interpretation of the data. The S-method is a post-hoc method of comparing experimental groups and is often referred to as a data-snooping or sifting device. The techniques discussed here are also of the data-snooping species and may be employed to generate new hypotheses or to amend the existing theory of a practical problem. (Author/CTM)",

Data sets were created with various characteristics (varying data reliability and extremeness of subgroups) that are relevant to the regression phenomenon. These data sets were analyzed to obtain indices of the amount of regression which might occur under various conditions. An adjustment method was presented which predicted pretest scores on the basis of selection scores and the correlation between selection and pretest, the correlation coefficient being replaceable by such indices of reliability as the internal consistency  coefficient. Results suggest that when data reliability is high (.94 or above) the impact of regression effects appears small; but when reliability is low the effects of regression are hard to predict. When selection test scores are of high reliability, such regressed scores may be used as a pretest measure without severely biasing the evaluation results. Results can be used to formulate a rule-of-thumb for adjusting selection scores when they are to be used as pretest scores also. (Author/CP)",

College students in three studies were asked to rate a total of 154 items, involving 14 modes of response (physiological or overt behavioral indicators) and eleven anxiety-arousing experiences. Three major problems are discussed: (1) the apparent lack of distinction between &quot;person&quot; and &quot;mode of response&quot;; (2) influence of the non-random selection of &quot;situations&quot; and &quot;mode of response&quot; on the results of the analysis; and (3) problems in specifying and assessing the nature of person-situation interactions. While initial efforts to statistically demonstrate variance  contribution of interactions deserve recognition, the variance components approach and previous application of the S-R Inventory do not lead to clarifying the specific nature of person-situation interactions in influencing anxiousness. Future research on person-situation interactions, therefore, identify specific person and situation characteristics and incorporate aspects of both these factors in a systematic research design.

Using high school subjects, convergent validity was assessed through correspondence of scaling solutions of three similarity rating tasks; word association, similarity judgment, and semantic differential. Further evidence was sought by grouping subjects within each data gathering technique by similarity of response using, separately, Tucker's and Carroll's individual scaling techniques. Subgroup membership comparisons were made within data gathering techniques across scaling techniques, and within scaling techniques across data gathering techniques. Characterization of subgroup members was attempted through several variables,  including developmental level, field independence, cognitive complexity, and measures of ability to cope with the similarity tasks. On full group data, fit was excellent between word association and similarity judgment data, and poorer with semantic differential data. Judging by the fit among the interpretability of subgroup solutions, both individual scaling techniques formed groups successfully. There was considerable commonality of subgroup membership across similarity tasks in the Carroll analysis only. Characterization of subgroup members by the chosen variables was unsuccessful. Due to error-full data, only Carroll analysis and not Kruskal analysis produced interpretable dimensions on the subgroup data. (Author/RD)",

        "description":"Videotaped recordings of supervisor-teacher micro-teaching playback sessions were used to identify evaluative discourse. Fifteen student teachers discussed a 10-30 minute lesson they had just taught to college freshmen, with graduate student supervisors. Supervisors and student teachers evaluated lesson topics such as teacher questions, content, lesson goals, methods, materials, and nonverbal behavior, with adjectives--good, bad, important; or with prescriptions--should, ought. The evaluation was then classified according to a variety of constructs including: components of the Smith valuing model; valence (positive, negative, neutral); initiator; and justification. The analysis indicated the following: (1) evaluations were unaccompanied by rules or standards for judging the  effectiveness of teaching interactions; (2) three-fourths of the evaluations were positive, but they failed to indicate both strengths and weaknesses; (3) teachers made more negative evaluations than supervisors; and (4) evaluative talk was characterized by a narrow topic range, restricted support, and vague focus.

        "description":"The authors argue that personnel who select standardized achievement tests have been led to believe that the major achievement test batteries differ very little in terms of the topics they test; but that the content covered by these major tests is different, and that such differences have consequences for instructional content. To test this argument, four fourth grade mathematics achievement tests were examined: the Stanford Achievement Test (SAT), Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS), Metropolitan Achievement Tests (MAT), and the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills (CTBS). Test content was compared to topics which a teacher might cover. In the &quot;operations&quot; category, the tests corresponded quite closely in the percentages of items involving certain adding, subtraction, and division  tasks. However, important differences were found in other categories and the number of items covering addition, grouping, alternative number systems, and percentages varied considerably between tests. Evidence of high internal consistency or test reliability does not rule out the effects of item-treatment-interactions. It is suggested that the problem of teachers teaching only the content covered by the test is not as great as might be thought. The authors recommend that tests be selected consistently and that their content be valid for the curriculum content. (Author/GDC)",

        "description":"Conventional approaches to program evaluation have followed the experimental and psychometric traditions dominant in educational research. Their aim (unfulfilled) of achieving fully objective methods had led to studies that are artificial and restricted in scope. Illuminative evaluation is introduced as a total re-appraisal of the rationale and techniques of program evaluation. It follows a contrasting 'anthropological' research paradigm. Illuminative evaluation recognizes that an innovative instructional program cannot be separated from its learning milieu--a network of cultural, social, institutional, and psychological forces. The evaluator concentrates on processes within the classroom rather than on outcomes (goals, objectives) derived from a specification of the  instructional system. Data is collected from observation, interview, questionnaires, and documentary information. Illuminative evaluation thus concentrates on the information gathering rather than on the decision making component of evaluation. The paper concludes with a discussion of the problems and potentialities of the new approach: its range of applicability; objectivity; validity; obligations of the research worker; how explorations of the learning milieu can meet the need for theoretical advance; and how the illuminative approach can clarify decision-making.

        "description":"It has been suggested that cognitive style interacts with performance on tasks measuring formal thought. It is hypothesized that cognitive style interacts with task context rather than with the underlying formal thought processes. Experiments are reported to clarify the type of task that elicits an interaction and to determine whether such interactions can be altered by instruction in formal thought processes. About 250 students age 12 to 16 participated in one of three experiments. Two tasks involving the separation of variables schema but contrasting contexts were administered to all subjects. In one context, only information necessary for applying the separation of variables schema was presented. In another context, the relevant information was embedded in irrelevant  additional information. Cognitive style was measured in two experiments. In one experiment, subjects taught the separation of variables schema were compared to uninstructed subjects. Results supported the hypothesis of the study: task context interacted with cognitive style and training or separation of variables did not appreciably affect performance on irrelevant context tasks.

        "description":"There are four steps in obtaining test data, each requiring planning and decision-making: assembling students, administering tests, scoring, and recording scores. In assembling students, two cautions are in order. First, for norm referenced tests, students in the treatment group should take the test at the same time of the year as the students in the norming sample. Second, high absenteeism, differences among test administrators, and in testing environments may significantly affect pretest-posttest scores. Publisher's manuals should be followed exactly to ensure consistency between treatment and comparison groups. From a research viewpoint, trained test administrators should be used rather than classroom teachers. Scoring decisions include selecting an answer form  (machine-scorable booklets vs. answer sheets); selecting a scoring agent (school personnel, test publisher, or independent test scoring company); and costs of scoring and of extensive statistical analysis. Finally, when recording scores, data forms should be carefully proofread. All scores should be completely identified and arranged to facilitate analysis. Eleven suggestions for designing test results forms discuss page numbers, testing date, group identification, confidentiality, test name, use of one sheet, arrangement and format of names, identification numbers, number of entries, and arrangement of columns.

Teachers are not immune to these attitudes. In addition to societal views, teachers are also influenced by social science research which has reinforced the notion that black children are inferior by describing them as disadvantaged, deprived, educationally handicapped, and verbally deficient. Social scientists have generated theories that reject the language and culture of these children, and teachers' attitudes and expectations tend to reflect these views. On the basis of a review of the research, it is suggested that teacher training programs, preservice and inservice,  should emphasize helping teachers develop an understanding and an awareness of individual as well as cultural and linguistic differences.

Older adults are interested in learning new things and are excited by interacting with younger people in intergenerational college courses. Many programs are being built on the 1965 Higher Education Act and other adult education legislation. The most recent of these, and perhaps most innovative, is ELDERHOSTEL. ELDERHOSTEL offers residential academic programs to persons over sixty within a network of over 100 college and university campuses in eighteen states for one-week periods. ELDERHOSTEL began in 1974, and in its first days offered fifteen weeks at five colleges to 220 persons. By 1977, 1,541 persons were being  served. The national office, located in Newton, Massachusetts, directs program coordination, standardization, and evaluation. Generally, liberal arts programs have been stressed. Each school is required to provide three college-quality courses with seven to ten contact hours a week. Courses are noncredit and require no tests, grades, or homework. Most programs are initially funded under Title I of the 1965 Higher Education Act. ELDERHOSTEL attempts to integrate older adults into the larger society through intergenerational classes. (CSS)",

The first of two chapters discusses the need to develop a professional development program for vocational education teachers. A two-phase process is described: phase 1--identification of performance requirements of conventional program teachers; and phase 2--identification of performance requirements for cooperative program teacher coordinators. The findings are the origin of 384 performance elements and a set of related performance oriented general objectives. Chapter 2, divided into 7 sections, discusses curricular development, testing, and implementation. Section 1 describes the  cooperation of institution/agency representatives in module development. Section 2 examines the preliminary module testing and results. Module revision procedures are outlined in section 3. Section 4 summarizes the advanced testing design and procedures. The fifth section provides model publication background. Module refinement, based on advanced testing feedback and publisher needs, is described in section 6. The final section reviews dissemination activities. Appendixes contain samples of the cooperative development stage module, data collection and synthesis forms, preliminary and advanced test versions, and revision procedures/quality control devices, and module titles and associated performance elements.

(The modules are based on 384 secondary/postsecondary level performance elements, including program, instructional, and other elements.) In the first of five sections the study purpose of providing user feedback for refining materials and information for developing specified competencies is identified. Instrumentation (teacher performance assessment form, pre-treatment performance estimate, and teacher trainee and resource person feedback booklets) is described. Test site and module selection are discussed, and section 2 reviews site coordinator training procedures. The third section provides  module-by-module and across-module analyses. Findings reported in section 4 include the following: (1) teacher trainee pre- and post-performance self-estimates increased for all modules; all modules were rated effective; (2) resource persons rated teacher trainees above \"good\" on tested modules; and (3) 75% of resource persons felt learning activities were helpful. Also examined are teacher trainee and resource person characteristics and feedback. The final section sets forth conclusions and recommendations. Appendixes contain instrumentation forms, evaluation, study, and results.

The objectives focused on infusion in grades K-12 of the Bangor Public School System and continued training of postsecondary instructional staff at the University of Maine at Orono and Husson College. This document reports the university-level activities. An eight-session seminar series for twenty university faculty was planned and conducted. Eight faculty members were selected to write twenty-six career education instructional units that could be utilized in a variety of college-level courses. (These units are included in the ERIC system as ED 143 814 and ED 166 365-366.) The project staff prepared a set of inservice training materials for use in  postsecondary institutions. Finally, a business and industry advisory group was selected to participate as a panel in the seminar series and to assist the writing team. Plans were made to evaluate the seminar series, career education instructional units, and the training materials.

        "description":"Various studies have been conducted to inductively locate the aspects of occupation in one generation which are transmitted to the next generation as found in corresponding aspects of their labor force aspirations and entry levels. This study restricted attention to intergenerational covariation in components of roles rather than to the structural or interpersonal mechanisms which might explain transmission. Occupations were conceptualized and measured on the basis of indicators for role requirements, content, and rewards. (The author states that role transmission presumes covariation between the requisites, routines, and rewards of parental occupations and the corresponding components of offspring aspirations and eventual labor force occupations.) Data were collected from a  national sample of male members of the civilian labor force and from a sample of Michigan high school males. Canonical correlation analysis was used as a multivariate strategy for partitioning the covariance between two sets of scores into orthogonal pairs of linear combinations (dimensions). Canonical correlation analyses for two role relationships, involving parent occupation, early career occupation and late adolescent occupational aspirations, show that (1) role transmission occurs for a multiplicity of occupational characteristics which span requirements, content, and rewards of roles; (2) that the two role relationships are not isomorphic in their structure; (3) that there is support for recent arguments that complexity of roles is a key organizing feature of role transmission  processes; and (4) that there is mixed support for recent research on patterns of intergenerational occupational movement.

        "description":"A two-phase study was conducted to determine the habits, attitudes, and values that industry and education consider desirable and important for workers. In phase I a computer search revealed sixty-three such affective work competencies which were then categorized into fifteen clusters. To objectively quantify each of the clusters, an evaluation instrument named the Affective Work Competencies Inventory (AWCI) was developed, which measured the behavior or performances of students and workers for each cluster. In phase II (which is described in greater detail in CE 018 917) an occupational matrix was developed to properly use the Inventory in relation to different vocational and technical occupations. Nine thousand inventories were printed and administered to students, workers,  teachers, and supervisors in Missouri. It was found that mean composite AWCI scores for (1) vocational students were greater than for academic students; (2) workers were greater than for vocational students; (3) occupational areas significantly differed; (4) female workers were significantly higher than for male workers; and (5) teachers, supervisors, and workers differed. Recommendations for effective use of this data include the development of curriculum materials to instruct students in affective work competencies, and the conduct of experimental programs to determine which teaching methods are effective and to what degree students retain the competencies they acquire.

Because few employment opportunities exist outside the government for controllers' skills, Congress established a second-career training program in 1972 for controllers so removed by the Federal Aviation Administration. Few air traffic controllers eligible for this training program have used it to train and enter second careers. Instead, they have used other federal programs providing long-term income and training benefits. These and other measures available to the Administration can effectively protect the economic livelihood of controllers. Congress should discontinue the Second-Career Program. (Author/CSS)",

In section I the term &quot;skills survey&quot; is defined and its functions are viewed as part of an upward mobility program. Section II lists the personnel involved in planning and implementing the survey. Section III advises each government agency to assess its own information needs by either examining its existing job descriptions or by performing a job analysis. The scope of the project and use of a timetable are discussed. Then, the pros and cons of various procedures are debated for obtaining specific data on employees' skills. The approaches considered include  (1) searching personnel files, (2) conducting personal interviews, (3) administering questionnaires to employees in groups, (4) mailing out questionnaires, and (5) using mail questionnaires with followup interviews. In section IV, government publications and Appendix 1 are suggested as resources for instructions on how to evaluate the data. Section V and Appendix 2 cover the methods of coding the data for storage and retrieval. The implementation and update of the survey are discussed in section VI. In the final two sections, the survey administrator is warned of various pitfalls and the need to comply with the Privacy Act. Appendixes 3 and 4 provide sample forms. (ELG)",

From July 1, 1976, through September 30, 1977, LaGuardia designed, or refined, and pilot-tested career educational components that included a career resource center, work experiences, career education infusion into curricula, career simulation activities, and career advisement. Following are some of the findings based on the evaluation surveys: (1) student ratings of the career resource center, career advisement, and career simulation were consistently positive; (2) students enrolled in a redesigned Data Processing Introductory course and work experience sequence viewed the infusion attempt as a  successful one, however time limitations imposed on the career education-infused Philosophy course made that experience less positive in the students' ratings; (3) the work internship program was positively judged by both interns and employers; and (4) the effective reality test in the workplace of the classroom-taught skills and concepts was seen as a prime outcome of LaGuardia's career education program. Twelve recommendations concerning implementation of career education were also presented, based on the pilot-test data.

It was found that women have difficulty selecting a nontraditional vocational program and that this problem is compounded by the pressure on women to choose academic preparation. Interest was the single most powerful force influencing women in their selection of vocational training. Ability in the occupational area was second, and earnings came third. Career education, career orientation, and job site visitation were considered more useful counseling techniques than individual counseling, vocational testing,  or group counseling. Educational personnel did not have a great impact on the career decision making of students. Counselors and teachers had more influence on traditional women than on nontraditional women. Parents were the most influential group for nontraditional students. Employment of women in related occupations simultaneous to their vocational training was an extremely important factor in improving their education and training. The largest single problem identified by women was the problem of men adjusting to women in their classroom, particularly if there were very few women in the classroom. (LMS)",

        "description":"The world economic situation is beset by growing worker dissatisfaction, slowing economic growth, and rising energy and resource costs. A partial solution to these problems may be worker participation in management and ownership. As production has become more dehumanized and workers have become increasingly dissatisfied and alienated, the quality of their work has suffered. To offset this malaise, various experiments have been conducted to improve the quality of work life and to give workers a voice in management decisionmaking. While workers in the U.S. often use unions to express their views, in other nations they hold seats on boards of directors and have formed work councils for this purpose. Ownership by workers may be either indirect in the form of investment funds and  employee stock ownership programs or direct in the form of co-ops. It is difficult to generalize about the economy-wide impact of worker participation because of the lack of controlled experiments and long-term data. However, it appears that participation certainly does not harm productivity and probably improves it. Presently, worker participation is at different stages in countries around the world due to variations in cultural backgrounds and histories. (ELG)",

        "description":"Although lifelong learning was a term created to mean cradle-to-grave learning, it has come to mean specifically adult learning and education. The adult learning force in the U.S. is huge and growing in size as well as interest. Since eighty-five percent of the active adult learners are high school graduates, they are eligible for postsecondary education. Many enroll in the formal programs offered by colleges and universities, but an even larger number spend time on self-directed, informal learning projects. Four social forces are contributing to this increase in adult education: (1) national pressure for expanded educational opportunities, which has resulted in learning no longer being tied to a physical location; (2) a combination of decreased emphasis on the credentials of the  educational provider and increased emphasis on the credentials of the learner, permitting academic credit for experiential learning; (3) recognition of the necessity for, and pleasure derived from, lifelong learning; and (4) the societal shift from a linear life plan to a blended life plan, which has been produced, in part, by the job shortage. Educational providers for lifelong learning are a diverse group including libraries, museums, and television as well as schools. As they develop their unique educational strengths, they will continue to provide education with a diversity of options. (ELG)",

        "description":"A study explored the results of programs designed to move women into traditionally male jobs (both managerial and blue collar) in ten public utility companies. The focus of the study was on the experiences of 164 women in such jobs and on the attitudes of their supervisors, male peers, and subordinates toward the companies' attempts to overcome job discrimination based on sex. The study also explored the impact of the women's new job patterns on their relationships with peers, parents, husbands, male friends, and children. The findings indicated that the experiences of the ten companies were considerably more positive than negative. Most of the women were seen to be performing well in their new jobs, although those in blue collar positions encountered more difficulties in the  form of inadequate prior training and harassment from male peers. There was also considerable evidence that negative attitudes and expectations on the part of male supervisors and peers were likely to change rapidly when the supervisors and peers had an opportunity to observe a woman performing effectively in a nontraditional job. Companies making the most progress in providing equal opportunities for women were those which planned the transition carefully, involved first-line supervisors in the planning, and provided central staff monitoring and guidance to managers attempting to meet Equal Employment Opportunity goals.

In the first of four sections the administrator's role is described, and the term \"needs\" is defined. Models are proposed for individual and institutional behavior. Section 2 reviews three assumptions as to why the assessment is being conducted; for example, the first assumption is that a needs assessment process leads to program support. This section advances an eight-step process for assessing needs: identify program goals, identify needed data, identify data available, identify data that must be gathered, gather data, identify discrepancies, rank order identified discrepancies,  and begin the program development process. How to gather and manage data are also examined. Section 3 focuses on the needs of specific adults. It is suggested that criteria, such as age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, handicaps, and educational status, can be used to identify program requirements for various subgroups. The involvement of community agencies in meeting special group needs is recommended. The report cautions against involvement with vested interests and notes particular problems in obtaining data from certain subgroups. The final section advises the use of the eight-step model to identify program needs. (CSS)",

Major survey findings were that (1) two-thirds of the seniors reported considering graduate school, with percentages by college ranging from a low of 56% in natural sciences to a high of 81% in social and behavioral sciences; (2) 85% of seniors indicated they did not have a job lined up after graduation; this percentage varied from 78% in general and comparative studies to 89% in fine arts; (3) although career field interests differed by college, greatest  interest areas for the total sample were education, health, and social services-related careers; (4) students in general and comparative studies appeared to be considering the broadest range of possible career fields; fine arts students seemed more narrowly focused; (5) 60% of the total sample wanted career/job information particularly in the employment outlook area; 28% requested help in choosing a career; (6) nearly half the seniors indicated a need for job-hunting assistance; and (7) post-graduation plans and indicated needs for career planning assistance varied by major.

The project conclusions include the following: vocational education program outcomes need to be closely linked to the values of individuals and groups  concerned with vocational education; the originators of data concerning the outcomes of vocational education--the local education agencies--must be the users of the data in order for ultimate improvements in vocational education to result; in general, placement data are not collected systematically with an emphasis on precision and accuracy; and quality of instruction, relevance of program, impact of program, and individual transition and growth represent four categories of possible criteria for which vocational education might be held accountable.

Fortunately, other pioneers, such as home economists and district agents with the University of Alaska Cooperative Extension Service, responded to villagers' home and community needs. The University of Alaska also pioneered in offering mining/prospecting non-credit courses. Other higher education institutions initiated programs; for example, Kuskokwin Community College (1974) offered one of the first adult education degree programs. The U.S. Army at Fort Richardson introduced in the 1950s adult basic education (ABE), which by 1957 included eighth grade and high school equivalency (GED) certificate programs. Finally, a GED program for non-commissioned native  officers was begun. Two other basic education pioneering efforts included training of native Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) teachers of ABE and the Anchorage Community College Adult Literacy Laboratory's development of culturally relevant educational materials. In determining the University of Alaska's adult education/training role, a study committee developed a continuing education plan. This was implemented in 1972. All provisions were realized, including continuing teacher education and satellite transmissions of GED tapes to many villages. In summary, there is a need to help adults obtain skills required by their vastly changed society; those finding new ways of helping adults learn will be called pioneers. (CSS)",

Focus was on disseminating information to the public on how to use energy more efficiently in the home. The basic format for disseminating information involved the following activities: public meetings to provide general information on home energy consumption and available energy-conserving techniques, how-to clinics to demonstrate energy-efficient techniques, and clearinghouse services to offer follow-up to the meetings and clinics. An assessment of the programs indicated that the pilot projects were successful in developing and increasing citizen awareness of the importance of home energy conservation. Based on personal contact with community residents and participant surveys, several  generalizations were made regarding public attitudes, including the following: (1) a majority of participants felt that an energy shortage exists in this country, (2) most people were convinced that there is a need for energy conservation, and (3) people felt that they could make an impact on reducing energy consumption as individuals but seemed willing only to undertake easy-to-do conservation methods.

Half of each group received the original questionnaire measuring product impact; half received the alternative questionnaire measuring product nonimpact. Three impact questionnaires, developed primarily by vocational education administrators, were constructed through item analysis. Nonimpact questionnaires stated the impact questions negatively. The student questionnaire contained 16 items, the teacher questionnaire 36 items, and the  administrator questionnaire 20 items. The following are original and alternative questionnaire discriminant validity correlations and reliability correlations for the three groups: students: -.049 validity, .83 reliability; teachers: -.18 validity, .78 reliability; and administrators: -.45 validity, .86 reliability. Better impact assessment was found in the administrator domain than in the student and teacher domains. Each adjusted questionnaire contains ten acceptably valid items. An example of sensitive/valid items from each domain is (1) students--gaining new knowledge from the product, (2) teachers--the completeness of details covered in the product, and (3) administrators--the absence of many better alternative products in the subject area.

A conceptual model of the student development process during high school is described in chapter 3. The importance of the school and its staff in career guidance, in both a  traditional and a proposed school system, is the focus of chapter 4. Some impressions, problems, and ideas for implementation are presented in chapter 5.

        "description":"Job creation properly researched and developed can help vitalize vocational education for educators, their students, and the community. The migration of employers from the inner cities to outlying areas over the past few years has created a wasteland within our cities. To help rectify this situation, vocational education needs to start preparing people to become employers, not only employees. After researchers identify community needs and resources, development teams can work with vocational education agencies to develop entrepreneurship programs for the area. As we move into a technological society, the impact of preparing people to work for themselves is one of the richest resources of futurism. Another pressing national problem is that resources and people are not in  appropriate proximity, such as the mismatch between the supply of job seekers and the existence of jobs. To date, vocational education has concentrated on creating job seekers but not recognized job creation as its legitimate concern. Vocational educators have the responsibility to examine and pursue some alternatives for interfacing with the problem of job creation. These alternatives include new urban renewal, decentralized urban renewal, and part-time job creation. (The authors' answers to questions from the audience of research and development staff are attached.) (EM)",

        "description":"This monograph represents a collaborative attempt to contribute to the definition and understanding of career education. The monograph begins with a conceptual view of career education as a collaborative community effort. The concepts themselves have been derived from interactions with over 200 persons selected as (1) philosophical leaders in the career education movement and (2) individuals representing a variety of community organizations holding potential for contributing to the career education efforts in selected communities across the nation. The second portion of this document is devoted primarily to the thoughts of twenty-four individuals, each from a particular kind of community organization coupled with selected community career education coordinators. These thoughts  are summarized under the following categories: (1) Determining What Needs to Be Done in Career Education Collaborative Efforts; (2) Who Is Responsible for Initiating Collaborative Efforts in Career Education?; (3) Career Education and Economic Education: Should They Join Together?; (4) What Should Be the Composition of a Community Collaborative Council?; (5) What Kinds of Issues Should Be Considered by Community Collaborative Councils?; (6) Should There Be a Separate Council for Vocational Education and Another for Career Education?; (7) How Can a Community Collaborative Career Education Effort be Sustained?; and (8) How Can an Effective Public Relations Effort for Career Education Be Conducted?

The guide is divided into three primary sections. The first section contains the content for job-seeking skills instruction and consists of five reading modules which deal with the following job-seeking stages: (1) deciding on the job to seek; (2) preparing and using a  personal data sheet; (3) searching for job opportunities; (4) applying for jobs; and (5) deciding on a job offer. (Written at the twelfth-grade reading level, these modules are interrelated in that each module builds upon preceding modules.) The second section contains twenty-one lesson guides, which parallel the reading modules and serve as the instructional outline. These lesson guides provide the following: lesson objective, content source, teaching time estimate, teaching ideas, critical learning activities, and a list of other materials needed. The third section consists of 110 sample test items. These items are intended to assist in the planning and/or evaluation of job-seeking skills instruction.

        "description":"Existing programs and needs for adult basic education (ABE) in British Columbia were assessed. A research committee examined adults' educational opportunities up to and beyond literacy levels. ABE was found, in general, to be an area of neglect and low priority. Adult needs remain high; for instance, census data reveals that nearly half a million adults have not gone beyond grade 8. Many family and psychological problems are associated with illiteracy. Nevertheless, present educational practices, such as inequitable tuition policies, inhibit adults' efforts to return to learning. Social and economic costs incurred through the educationally disadvantaged individuals' unemployment and welfare status are high. The Ministry of Education plays a minimal role in ABE services provision.  The federal Department of Manpower has influenced educational practices throughout the provinces, but provisions have tended to be spasmodic. Each year ABE involves approximately 500 courses, 6,000 students, and 500 instructors throughout the province. The main prerequisite for closing the gap between needs and ABE provisions is an integrated and systematic approach. Although many goals and recommendations have been formulated, the principal recommendation is to regard ABE as an integrated system to aid in the amelioration of provincial problems in such areas as unemployment and social welfare.

        "description":"Women's educational needs and the viability of postsecondary institutions are inextricably bound. Women are in transition. Increasingly entering the labor force, women see postsecondary institutions as a means of accomplishing new occupational goals. Now a postsecondary student majority, they are, because of their age, part-time status, and large numbers, considered nontraditional. While some exemplary programs for women exist at British Columbia's postsecondary institutions, most nontraditional learning opportunities are ad hoc, peripheral, fragmented and demonstrate a lack of institutional commitment. An institutionally based Women's Access Program should be adopted. Planning and implementation guidelines for such a program have been developed and are included in this report.  Program goals are to assist women in obtaining access to postsecondary institutions and community services and resources, and to assist institutions in modifying practices which present barriers to women. Recommendations to the Ministry of Education and a plan to assist institutions achieve these goals have been formulated. Hopefully, institutions will adopt policies which accommodate the needs of women learners. (Author/CSS)",

The favored mechanism for the delivery of women's access programs and services is the Women's Resources Centre model. The center extends women's access programs and services. These programs and services function as educational brokers and assist women in planning their lives. Although women are the new client group for education, postsecondary institutions are not planned for the mature women, and they are fairly inflexible. Women require services to assist them in updating their expectations and working out ways to combine family responsibilities with study and labor force participation. Women are having fewer children and are  becoming a higher proportion of the labor force. Women's access programs and services operate by providing information and counseling in community-based settings staffed by volunteers working with professionals. Budgets for an adequately equipped, and alternatively a minimally supported, resources center have been prepared. (Appendixes contain information on a volunteer employment program, rural women's skill development, and life planning methods.) (Author/CSS)",

Job creation program activities were examined in terms of how many activities could be undertaken; what would be their costs; and what would be their characteristics (labor-intensity, skill-mix, and political acceptability) that might contribute to cost benefit analysis. Onsite and offsite job-creation was considered. The potential inflationary pressure that could be generated was also considered. Finally, administrative and organizational issues that might pose significant implementation barriers were reviewed. Information was gathered through field visits and correspondence with national organization representatives in Washington and representatives from twenty-four local  communities. Some major findings and conclusions are (1) the study identified 233 potential job-creation activities in twenty-one program areas. The largest number of activities were in public works, environmental quality, education, social services, and criminal justice; (2) inferences about average costs and targeting effectiveness should not be drawn from onsite job-creation and cost data alone; (3) worker selection targeting restrictions and eligibility criteria ought to be flexible; and (4) selected priorities areas include housing, health, and criminal justice. Inadequate planning time and training resources were singled out, among seven potential barriers, as amenable to policy actions to minimize the difficulties they produce. (CSS)",

The vocational system has paid too little attention to self-employed persons who discover and create their own jobs. These entrepreneurs are essential to economic vitality. There is a parallel need to create more entrepreneurial work opportunities inside existing organizations. The time has come to focus national attention on education for self-employment. We should (1) re-examine public policy to see how government may be discouraging small business formation, (2) enlarge our manpower policy conceptions to include self-employment incentives, (3) encourage business to redefine  employment in entrepreneurial terms, and (4) learn how to modify educational programs to prepare people for entrepreneurially defined work.

Close  behind was Super's Developmental Self-Concept Theory and Blau's Conceptual Framework of Occupational Choice. O'Hara's Learning Theory, Super's Developmental Self-Concept Theory, and Hoppock's Composit Theory had a mean rank of first through third respectively in regard to the usefulness of the theories for teaching and/or counseling students. In addition, a rank-order correlation was computed to determine the degree of relationship between the rankings of the theories in regard to self-development and usefulness in teaching and/or counseling. Correlations ranged from .79 to .98. The order that emerged is subject to further study. Other populations may rank the theories differently, depending on background and experience. (BM)",

Four general perspectives are reviewed concerning the diffusion of such a new technology as solar energy systems, with special attention to the education and training issues. Planning and analysis issues discussed include the following: whether there is a need for more education and training programs, and of what kinds; the possible roles of the federal and state governments; the availability of trained workers for the manufacture of solar systems; the tradeoffs between  expanding the capabilities of persons already within the field or training unemployed and underemployed persons as solar workers; and the allocation of effort between training workers and training trainers. Examples of programs and courses are given for the four identified categories: general education, professional solar energy education and training, technician training, and solar industries infrastructure training. The general conclusion is that a large number and variety of education and training programs and courses are presently offered, but that little or no evaluation of individual programs or the overall effort has yet been done.

Catecholamine (adrenaline and non-adrenaline) secretion for twenty United States Air Force student pilots and thirteen instructor pilots was determined during daily activities, during simulated flights performed in high realism simulators, and during actual flight. High realism simulation resulted in a measurable stress response in both students and instructors; the response was not related to previous flight experience. One group of students experienced power-on stalls and spin recoveries in the simulator prior to their introduction in the aircraft. A second group of students experienced power-on stalls and spin recoveries in the aircraft prior to their introduction in the simulator.  Catecholamine secretion during simulation was not different for the two groups, thus aircraft exposure to the spin series did not alter the stress response of the students attempting a similar maneuver in a high realism simulator. Task-specific high realism simulation introduced prior to exposure to related, stressful in-flight tasks results in similar total stress response, but somewhat lower arousal and greater mental activity. A comparison of superior and inferior students within each group suggested that the simulator pretraining had the greatest effect on the inferior students. There was a significant negative relationship between student performance and instructor stress during the initial aircraft power-on stall and spin-recovery sortie. (Author/CT)",

The document emphasizes the treatment and beneficial utilization of sludge and wastewater as opposed to waste disposal. These objectives are achieved through incorporation into well-designed and operated agricultural production systems in ways that are compatible with maintaining the soil's normal viability and productivity. Waste characterization, crop selection and management, site selection, management and monitoring are addressed. Sample problems, procedures, calculations and diagrams are incorporated into most sections. In addition, public health and nuisance concerns, as well as  public acceptance, legal and economic considerations are discussed. (Author/BB)",

The manual focuses on management decisions which must be made in implementing energy conservation programs for existing buildings. It provides assistance in developing a plan of attack, establishing schedules, selecting buildings, creating preliminary energy savings estimates, developing engineering work statements, evaluating consultants, estimating fees, and rough estimating of construction costs. An initial assumption is made that many jurisdictions already have begun low-cost conservation measures such as lowering thermostat settings, night temperature set backs, de-lamping and closing off unused spaces. Attention, therefore, is directed  toward additional steps often requiring some capital expenditure that can be taken to gain further substantial energy savings. Retrofit for energy conservation in existing buildings, as addressed in this manual, should be applicable to many state, county and local governments and special purpose districts. Experience has proven that energy can be saved and energy costs reduced significantly by concentrating on modifications to building use patterns, operating procedures and design aspects. These savings can occur without sacrificing occupant comfort or important functions to be performed within the facility. (Author/BB)",

It is designed to acquaint visitors and residents with the stages of development that shaped both ports and the way that Fairfield has evolved through wars, depressions, and periods of prosperity over the centuries. From Black Rock and Southport, both natural harbors, goods and produce were shipped in early colonial days. Black Rock was a major West Indies trading port and shipbuilding center, while Southport was the base for a market fleet and a residence for wealthy shipowners. Later, during the Victorian era, these areas became summer resorts, and still later became mostly residential communities. The history of Black Rock is traced from  its beginning in 1644 through the hey-days of its West Indies trade, 1760 to 1815. Its declining period between 1865 and 1900 is discussed, followed by a report of the port's evolution into a residential community during the 20th century. Southport contains some of the finest architecture and streetscapes design produced in early America. From its beginnings Southport had a simple village atmosphere, mainly due to its residents' successful prevention of the development of a manufacturing economy. The history of Southport is traced from its origins as a farm community in 1661 through 1800. From 1800 to 1854 it was a center for coast trading, and then gradually evolved more and more to a residential area. Throughout the document existing historical landmarks are noted. The document also  contains numerous maps and photographs. (BC)",

The report focuses on national legislation dealing with individual privacy, in particular the Privacy Act of 1974, and considers several new statutes which concern the privacy of participants in research. A large portion of the paper discusses (1) regulations concerning access to administrative records and data, statistical microdata, and archived data; and and (2) regulations on data handling within social science research. The Privacy Act of 1974 permits individuals to gain access to personal records maintained by federal agencies and to challenge incorrect information. The law restricts the kinds of identifiable information that an agency may collect, and regulates the disclosure of  personal information by federal agencies. However disclosure of anonymous records for research purposes is expressly permitted by the law. Following a 1977 meeting between social scientists and the Privacy Protection Study Commission, the Commission recommended disclosure of administrative or research records in identifiable form, for purposes of legitimate research, provided that certain conditions are met. The conditions are generally reasonable, e.g., the disclosure of identifiable records must be necessary to accomplish the research or statistical purpose. (RM)",

        "description":"To establish an objective conception of human rights, one must first identify basic needs intrinsic to all people and then determine whether these needs are or can be hierarchically ordered. Many scholars have conducted research on the concept of human needs, particularly in the area of human rights. Among these scholars are Abraham H. Maslow (\"The Psychology of Science: A Reconnaissance\"); J.C. Davies (\"Human Nature in Politics\"); and Christian Bay (\"The Structure of Freedom\"). Basic human needs identified by these and other scholars provide a general outline for a hierarchy of human rights. Most basic of these rights are satisfaction of physiological and safety needs. Physiological rights are interpreted to include the right to life and to bsic requirements such as food, water,  and air. Safety rights include protection from physical or psychic injury. Next in importance after physiological and safety rights are gratifications such as love, esteem, and self-actualization. The author concludes that this objectiVe and hierarchical conception of human rights avoids drawbacks of traditional definitions of human rights based on (1) historical and cultural traditions, (2) philosophical systems such as Marxism or positivism, or (3) a general perception of equal and universal human worth. Difficulties related to traditional conceptions of human rights include cultural and ideological parochialism, vagueness, difficulty of definition, and confusion of natural desires and natural rights.

        "description":"The paper examines trends of postponement of marriage among women in their early twenties. Data for the study were taken from a national longitudinal study of 5,159 women (ages 14 to 24) who were interviewed from 1968 to 1975. The author specifically examined the young women for three characteristics: current employment status, level of education, and long-run expectations about labor force participation. Between 1969 and 1975 the proportion of single women in their early twenties who planned to be housewives decreased sharply. Consequently, the change in future work plans reduced the chances that a woman in her early twenties would marry in the next few years. Previously, single women in their early twenties who had more education were more likely to marry in the near future.  Yet because the decline in those planning to be housewives was greater for women with more education, women whose level of education gave them a stronger marriage market position were more likely to change their future work plans in a way which reduced their probability of marriage. The author compares aspects of this trend among black and white women, and explores implications of the shift in work expectations for other changes in family life. (Author/AV)",

        "description":"A survey of 524 planning agencies and consultants in the Midwest and Southwest was undertaken in 1976 to identify skills required for planning and to assess current capabilities in those skill areas. The major purpose of the survey was to aid geographic educators as they prepare students for careers in the planning profession. One part of the survey identified the major planning functions of the 524 respondents. These functions emphasized community development, housing, transportation, capital improvements, zoning, land use, preparing federal and state applications, and general planning research. In another part of the survey, respondents were asked to rate 70 different skills for their importance to the operation of their organizations. Skills ranked essential by more than 40%  of the respondents included the abilities to write clear and concise reports, work effectively with other professionals, present technical issues to public officials and to citizens' groups, develop land-use maps, and assist in environmental impact assessment. To develop skills in these areas, geography educators should provide training in mapping and graphics, secondary data recovery, communications, primary data generation, quantitative methods, and interpretation of legal processes as they apply to planning.

        "author":["Rosmann, Michael R."],
        "description":"This program report traces the development of the University of Virginia's undergraduate internship program. The original internship program was established in 1973 to provide social science majors, chiefly psychology majors, with opportunities to apply academically derived knowledge and skills in community service areas. Funded by a federal ACTION grant, the program placed 85 students for 12-month tenures at 28 community agencies oVer a three-year interval. Upon termination of federal funding in 1976, a state-funded program was initiated to coordinate internships for approximately 30 psychology and 20 sociology majors annually at 29 community agencies. The second program was designed to correct several shortcomings revealed from an evaluation of its predecessor. The results of  two separate evaluations--one of the first federally-funded internship program and one of the current state-funded program--are presented in this report. The evaluation of the current program shows that many positive results of the first internship program are still being experienced. Interns rate themselves as significantly more fulfilled, active, worthwhile, and possessing a more broadened outlook on life than students who have not participated in the program. The interns are more sure of their career choices. In addition, the interns' grade point averages improved more during their internship year than did those of other psychology and sociology majors.

        "description":"This paper hypothesizes the crucial factors necessary for the transformation of rebellion into separatist movements. It examines the Kurds in Turkey, Iran, and Iraq as a case study to test the hypotheses. Separatism is seen to include attempts by an ethnic group to achieve complete independence from the nation in which it resides. It can also include efforts to increase group autonomy ranging from increased local decision-making rights to confederation, just short of independence. In the first part of the paper the author discusses the conditions necessary to the development of separatist movements. First, the ethnic group must be included within a national boundary containing other dominant groups. The second condition of separation is unequal economic and political relations  between the ethnic periphery and the central groups. Third, there must be penetration and activation of the ethnic periphery. Finally, separatism requires an organized periphery capable of coordinating the movement and linking it to outside groups. In the second part of the paper the author shows that the separatist movements of the Kurds in Turkey, Iran, and Iraq are an excellent case for the preliminary testing of the hypothesized conditions of separatism. The conditions outlined in part one are examined in the historic context of each nation. The author concludes that to the extent that these factors that spur separatist movements continue to characterize the modern world, we should expect to see an increase in ethnic conflict, separatist and otherwise.

        "description":"Although homosexuality was considered to be a crime in nineteenth-century England, the subculture of the school system promoted it. For example, in the early nineteenth century schoolboys of all ages were locked up in dormitories at 8:00 p.m. and no master entered the building until the next morning. No-one supervised the boys' activities during the night. In the late 1820s reforms were introduced which continued to promote homosexual practices. At this time the prefect system was established, by which older boys were appointed to exercise a moral influence and to control the younger boys' behavior. Under this system &quot;fagging&quot; became popular. Small boys had to carry out tasks for larger boys, and sexual services were frequently included among these tasks. Another frequent  practice within the school system, flogging, may have encouraged variant sexual practices. Prefects and teachers were allowed to exercise this corporal punishment which might have encouraged sadistic impulses. A large body of literature, including diaries, indicates that homosexual practices were indeed common within the schools. It is ironic that the English legal and social community publicly denounced homosexuality, because most adult males had participated in or observed these practices when they themselves were in school. Homosexual teachers tended to keep their preferences secret because embarrassment or dismissal could result if they were publicly exposed. (AV)",

        "description":"The paper describes a study to measure the relationship of teacher expectations to student characteristics and academic achievement. Specifically, the study assessed the validity of principles regarding teacher expectations set down by sociologists Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis. Bowles and Gintis maintained that teacher expectations are substantially affected by students' personalities, social and family backgrounds, presentation of self, and cognitive skills. Data were taken from 1,825 eighth grade students in 18 desegregated junior high schools in Washington, Texas, and California. Teachers rated students with regard to personality characteristics, cognitive skills, and students' presentation of self. Ratings and predictor variables including ethnicity and sex were analyzed  by standard regression techniques. Findings indicated that the Bowles and Gintis model was not entirely upheld because teachers' expectations were much more powerfully influenced by teacher perceptions of cognitive skills than by students' presentation of self, personality characteristics, or ascriptive characteristics. Additional research is suggested on processes of development and change in areas of personality characteristics, skills regarding the presentation of self, student educational and occupational expectations, cognitive skills, academic success, and teacher expectations.

Values are interpreted to include fundamental criteria which give meaning and order to life. Although values are transmitted by numerous sources including the family, social groups, religious institutions, and schools, religious and secular research indicates that parents are the primary educators of their children. Catholic parents will be more effective as values transmitters if they familiarize themselves with Catholic social theory and with values research. Catholic social theory stresses the need for organizations of Catholic parents to work closely with religious education programs. Secular research organizations  provide information about values transmission from the perspective of modern social science. Parents must also realize that participation in their childrens' education will change as their children develop from total dependence at birth to relative independence at maturity. The conclusion is that Catholic parents can become more effectively involved in education if they form coalitions with like-minded parents and community members, encourage plurality of thought and action within coalitions, familiarize themselves with Catholic social thought, and become informed about values research.

The first premise is almost always attacked by critics, but it is the second premise--the assumed effectiveness of accreditation and certification practices in law and medicine--that is especially questionable.

Analysis of the survey showed the tasks are considered important by all of the publics, and that for each task there are unique patterns of expectations regarding task responsibility.

The practicing teacher is not likely to find most prevailing inservice systems (college courses, staff development programs, and teacher centers) adequate, and many examples show that inservice systems are less responsive to change than the society in which they exist. Collaboration as an alternative is faced with  attitude problems and a lack of enthusiasm, as well as university policy of discouraging teacher organization participation. The benefits, however, are obvious; inservice education can only be made whole if a means is found to expand the limits of unilateral perception by the integration of all points of view. (DS)",

General teaching competencies were adapted to meet the specific needs of teachers working with handicapped children. Current university courses were examined to determine which of the identified competencies were being met, and new courses were developed to help meet curriculum deficiencies. Evaluation strategies were established to measure demonstrable achievement of the specified competencies. Finally, appropriate university courses were developed into functional programs leading to either the Master of Arts in Teaching or Master of Science Degrees. The procedures used to  achieve the objectives for this project, as well as the identified roles and competencies, curriculum sequence, and evaluation models are discussed in detail in this document. Course outlines for newly developed courses are appended. (JD)",

The workshops, conducted in early 1978, focused on three aspects of faculty development for inservice: the identification and and analysis of current and likely future staff development in colleges and universities whose mission in elementary and secondary school is to assist in the continuing education of practicing teachers; an expansion of awareness among college and university faculty on the state of the scene in inservice education and the roles they can assume in the process; and the provision of examples different colleges and universities have used in providing staff development services. The monograph is divided into seven sections, excluding introductory remarks. Section  one considers various meanings of the term &quot;faculty development,&quot; and places focus on the provision of more effective job-imbedded inservice education to school personnel. Section two examines the nature and impact of total institutional contexts, local school and community contexts, and state contexts upon the provision of staff development efforts. Section three reports on critical development needs, and section four relates those needs to components of inservice education. Section five details the search for exemplary programs of faculty development for inservice education. Section six presents a college-wide approach to the problem, and section seven presents recommendations and conclusions drawn from the regional workshops. (MJB)",

Statements were written in five-choice Likert format to express attitudes toward these six educational issues: (1) interdisciplinary approaches; (2) process emphasis as opposed to content emphasis; (3) behaviorist methods; (4) moral and ethical education; (5) theory based teaching; and (6) performance based education. The number of statements was reduced from 66 to 36 after preliminary testing with 265 students in an undergraduate teacher education program. Factor analyses were performed on the final instrument to verify the construction of scales and item  selection. Results of the factor analysis reproduced the predefined scales to a reasonable degree. Test-retest reliability coefficients ranged from .67 to .80. Two rather global teacher attitude measures were also administered concurrently with the AEI--the Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory (MTAI) and the Education Scale (ES-VII). The correlation matrix of scores for the 265 subjects on the MTAI, ES-VII, and AEI was used as a preliminary indication of the independence of the six scales. Results of the various correlations and factor analyses are attached. (Author/CP)",

        "description":"The feasibility of implementing self-paced computerized tailored testing evaluation methods in an undergraduate measurement and evaluation course, and possible differences in achievement levels under a paced versus self-paced testing schedule were investigated. A maximum likelihood tailored testing procedure based on the simple logistic model had previously been used for evaluation in this course; however, scheduling of the testing sessions had been determined by the instructor. The basic thrust of the initial question addressed the possibilities of having students determine when they would prefer to take the exams. The study also investigated whether or not there would be significant differences in achievement level of students allowed to schedule their exams and those whose  exams were scheduled by the instructor. One hundred and seventy-two undergraduate students participated in the study. Students were randomly assigned to nine experimental groups consisting of combinations of two exams with the following testing schedules: paced tailored test, self-paced tailored test, and traditional paper and pencil test. Results on a comprehensive final were used as dependent measures. Since computerized tailored testing did not, in itself, affect achievement, and since it provides immediate feedback to the student, it is concluded to be an increasingly feasible method of testing.

Alternative purposes for an evaluation study are discussed and illustrated. In addition, values hidden in terminology, value-laden evaluation models, an evaluators' personal values and an illustration of evaluator roles are treated. The benefits and problems of values are discussed and four means of clarifying values in evaluation work are outlined. The first approach suggests that all relevant value positions need to be identified and stated publicly. The second  approach emphasized the need to clarify the evaluator's role in the assessment process. Is he/she describing the program, recommending evaluation criteria, or rendering an actual judgment of worth? Through identifying his/her role, the evaluator can choose to de-emphasize his or her personal values. The third approach suggests explicitly incorporating opposed values into evaluation studies by conducting comparative analysis. The fourth approach reflects attempts to search out conflicting value positions to insure an appreciation of the full range of potentially influential values. (Author/JAC)",

Artificial or simulated data representing departures of varying degrees from the assumptions of the three-parameter logistic test model were generated and the &quot;goodness-of-fit&quot; of the three test models to the data was studied. From the data sets analyzed in the study, it is clear that there are some sizable gains to be expected with modest length tests (n=20) in the correct ordering of examinees at the  lower end of the ability continuum when three-parameter model estimates are used (as opposed to the number right score). The gains were cut roughly in half when the tests were doubled (n=40) in length. Item discrimination parameters as scoring weights had very little effect on the results. (Author)",

Diagnostic test results and cultural and familial information taken from case files of children who had been diagnosed as either LD, educable mentally handicapped, emotionally disturbed, or physically handicapped were examined relative to their discriminative efficacy in differentiating between the four diagnostic groups. A total of 1,596 children between the ages of 6 and 17 years, with close to average intelligence, were used in this study. Discriminant functions analyses were performed on 52 variables; these  analyses consistently failed to discriminate LD children from the other three groups. A transpose factor analysis was performed on groups by chronological age, in intervals of three years. Finally, ANOVA's were performed on 17 variables. It was impossible to discriminate between the four diagnostic groups by any of these methods. A more appropriate diagnostic model which accounts for the child's unique processing (organizing, storing, rehearsing and retrieving) of information relative to his content base and ability to perform a corresponding behavior is proposed.

Part A of this report, briefly describes the design of the sample, including provisions for selecting alternate schools for those that declined to participate, the detailed stratification plan, and an overview of the project. Part B presents a synopsis of the findings which indicated that the majority of the estimated totals for the base year survey were significantly biased by the lack of data from the nonresponding schools. This conclusion is based on data from the first  follow-up survey of 1973 which reduced the nonresponse rate to a minimal two percent. Part C describes the methodology and assumptions of the statistical procedures used in estimating the bias resulting from nonresponse. Part D tabulates the statistical results of this study. The appendix provides an alternative methodology for estimating bias in the base year statistics. (CTM)",

The immediate reaction group was instructed to rely on their first impressions of the items and were advised not to go back once they had responded to a statement. The careful response group was instructed to be as sincere and accurate as possible in their answers and to feel free to change responses if necessary. For each group, coefficient alpha was computed as an estimate of internal consistency. The t-test and discriminant analysis were used  to contrast the two data sets. No item types could be identified to differentiate between the two groups of respondents.

        "description":"Test evaluation summaries completed by the Center for the Study of Evaluation in 1970 and 1976 were used to determine changes in test quantity and quality among elementary-level standardized instruments. In the earlier studies, the instruments were rated in four general areas: measurement validity, examinee appropriateness, administrative usability, and normed technical excellence. Ratings covered critical indicators of test quality including reported validity and reliability and quality of score distribution. To determine changes in quantity, a cross-tabulation was constructed for 1970 and 1976 data showing the number of tests available for 41 educational goal areas at each grade level. The qualitative analysis focused on tests of: attitudes, values and motivation; reasoning,  arithmetic operations, and reading readiness. Quality ratings were compared for concurrent and predictive validity and test reliability. The number of tests evaluated in each educational goal area in 1970 and 1976 are included, as well as the numbers and percentages of tests rated for validity and reliability. Results indicated that the quantity of elementary level standardized tests increased greatly and that increases were proportionally consistent within subject areas. However, despite an enormous growth in the number of tests, a parallel growth in quality did not occur. (Author/JAC)",

Mean test scores for high test anxious students in the language labs were significantly higher than mean scores of high test anxious students taking the same tests in large lecture halls. Marginally low anxious students not seated adjacent to high test anxious students had mean test scores significantly higher than marginally low anxious students adjacent to high test anxious students. High anxious and low anxious students working in standard lecture halls had significantly different test scores while high  anxious and low anxious students in language labs had no significant differences. In a follow-up study, it was found that stress reducing techniques administered at the beginning of stressful examinations eliminate the usual negative correlation between high test anxious states and final grades. It was concluded that environmental and situational variables have important differential effects on high and low anxious students, and mask learning performance. (Author/JAC)",

The panel felt that the overall purpose of the accountability program was praiseworthy, but that the minimum competency testing program, with its mandatory standards for receiving a high school diploma, was seriously faulty because it took primary responsibilities away from the local school when the Florida Legislature had adopted a policy of school-based management. A strategy which the panel recommended for increased effectiveness would be to help schools identify their particular problems and assist each school in developing educational programs designed to  attack those problems. Standards and requirements for promotion would then be based on more reasonable expectations. The panel also felt that an essential step for improvement would be to reconstruct the educational environment outside the school. Program inadequacies are attributed to excessive haste in instituting the program and failure to communicate with all participants. In addition, the panel felt that an attempt to have the public assume responsibility for out-of-school education should have been an early step in the accountability program. (Author/JAC)",

        "description":"Since ethnic studies in schools is an integral part of the larger social system in this country, its current status, problems and strengths must be examined within the total social context. Ruling groups determine the formulation and dissemination of knowledge (particularly negative social science research about ethnic groups and the poor). This knowledge is designed to support the status quo, and to legitimize the position of those in power. Ethnic studies programs must be replanned and novel teaching strategies formulated in order for students to effectively challenge and invalidate the assumptions about ethnic groups on which white-dominated social science research is often based. A primary goal of ethnic studies must be to help minority students to psychologically liberate  themselves from myths and stereotypes and to help them to develop a commitment to social change. Unfortunately, reform of current programs is needed, as dissension among different ethnic groups, lack of funds, and inadequately qualified instructors have caused them to be self defeating. Despite the difficulties that minority leaders encounter, they should demand this reform and take steps to see that ethnic studies programs survive and gain integrity. (Author/KR)",

A recommended strategy for implementation of the process is included in this report. Building-level information is provided in the school profiles project, in such areas as staffing, teacher characteristics, class size, program budgeting, school safety and environment. These profiles are used to assess trends and make comparisons between schools as well as being utilized in the goal setting process by administrators. The management development program, on the other  hand, provides a means to reduce costs and improve the quality of education services by improving the management skills of school personnel. The project encompasses ten tasks which involve indentifying each job task, forecasting employment needs, and developing job-related instructional programs for personnel. The research on long run changes in the composition of the labor force in the Chicago public schools will provide critical information on staffing trends for the management development program.

At the preschool level, studies in which parents were instructed concerning methods of promoting their children's intellectual development were found to be particularly successful in producing long-term improvements in the academic achievement of low SES children. A few studies also report success in improving the achievement of low SES children whose parents work as paraprofessionals in the school, or serve in an advisory capacity for preschool programs. At the elementary level, the limited research which is available indicates that parents who serve as tutors for their children can  improve their children's academic achievement. More research on methods of improving academic achievement through parent involvement programs is still needed, but the research thus far has generally shown that such programs do have a positive effect on academic achievement.

It completes the analysis of the study areas of funds allocation, service delivery, student development, and program administration, and provides both follow-up findings and additional information on Title I operations. Chapter I addresses the feasibility and effects of changing the current formula of within-district allocation procedures, one comparison being between poverty-based and achievement-based allocation strategies. Chapter II compares the training and experience of regular and compensatory education teachers and examines the degree to which Title I funds are used for training purposes. In Chapter III, test data are examined in order  to determine whether the apparent effectiveness of the compensatory education instruction remains constant over a full year. A new area of report findings, the role of the Parent Advisory Councils, is explored in Chapter IV. Regulations governing the councils, the ways in which States and districts implement these regulations, and the actual operation of the councils as seen by parent participants are analyzed. In the final chapter, the local administration of the Title I, especially district and school planning and evaluation activities, is described. Statistical tables are included throughout the report.

        "description":"This report provides background and data from an investigation of New York City's summer youth employment program. It concludes that the program was poorly planned and poorly administered by both the Department of Labor and the city. Although some of the worksites visited were providing useful work experience to enrolled youths, over half of the worksites had serious problems, such as insufficient work or absent enrollees recorded as present. In these instances, program objectives may have been defeated by fostering bad work habits and paying salaries for little or no work. The following factors contributed to the problems found: (1) inadequate planning resulted in an insufficient number of productive jobs and a lack of control over program operations and over the use of Federal  funds; (2) project sponsors from previous years were generally refunded with little consideration of their past performance and major sponsors were automatically refunded; (3) the methods used to register youths gave rise to questions about the income eligibility of some of the enrollees and reportedly resulted in all-night lines and rowdyism; (4) monitors were inadequately trained, many worksites were not visited, and problems noted were frequently not followed up on to insure corrective action.

        "description":"Earlier studies of the effect of desegregation on white flight were in conflict, largely because of methodological differences in study design and analysis. More recent studies have used more comparable methodologies and tend to show that under certain conditions desegregation does have a significant effect on white loss, although there is still disagreement on the size and duration of the effect. The present study offers a demographic projection method for estimating the size and duration of the white phenomenon and applies the method to school districts experiencing court-ordered mandatory desegregation. Findings indicate that white losses are such that, in many cases, the amount of desegregation (defined as minority exposure to whites) is declining, and for some districts has  fallen below the pre-segregation level. As a result, court-ordered desegregation, coupled with normal demographic trends, is producing increasing ethnic and racial isolation in many larger school districts. If this trend is to be stopped or reversed other remedies need to be considered. Given the strong public opposition to mandatory busing as well as the current legal situation, the prospects for metropolitan desegregation appear limited. On the other hand, voluntary methods have worked well in some cases and may offer a more viable alternative in larger cities. (Author/EB)",

An examination of these factors and their relationships to sex and occupational aspiration variables indicates that there are no significant relationships between sex and perceptions of either individual or structural blockage types, or between occupational aspirations and the structural blockage type. However, as shown in a study of black South Carolina high school students, aspirations are significantly related to perception of individual blockage to attainment. These findings substantiate the contentions that a multidimensional treatment of goal blockage can be useful in assessing the factors black youth  perceive as inhibiting their occupational attainment. By specifying particular blockage types, differences between groups can be observed which would not be apparent if a single scale of blockage items had been used. (Author/EB)",

Elements of the various constituents of the learning encounter are itemized in order to assist professionals in analyzing the interaction between learner and situation. Features of the participants, the context and the learning process are included. A review of selected literature which touches on the issue of learning from urban resources is also provided. Writings that describe three different kinds of resources (museums, settlement houses,  and the city as a built environment) are identified. It is suggested that educators could apply the urban resource framework to these works, in order to use the literature more creatively and systematically in their thinking about urban education. The challenge for educators, it is held, is to understand how people can learn from the city's non-school resources, and to create ways of enhancing that process. (Author/EB)",

A national seminar of representatives elected at each consultation was held to focus attention on the issues raised by the women at the regional meetings. Each region conducted the project with some variety in number and type of participants and issues raised. At the national seminar, held at the White House, concerns of transportation, the welfare system, child care, and discrimination were voiced to  Federal administrators. The administrators responded with advice that women become a political power group in order to receive their share of dollars for programs.

        "description":"Most research on economics education has focused on the production function for teaching economics in colleges and universities. This concentration on higher education is notable because the majority of students never go to a four-year college. They therefore have access to formal economics education only in high school or junior college, if at all. Moreover, the concentration of the research on teaching in schools (at any level) overlooks the fact that most people never have and never will take an economics course. For these people, learning economics occurs through newspaper columns, magazine articles, television, and other mass media. But research on the effectiveness of these mechanisms is essentially nil. Whatever the effectiveness may be of current means of teaching  economics, and whatever the associated costs, a key question remains: What incentives exist for the adoption of efficient instructional approaches? Do the instructors or administrators who choose the production techniques to be used in teaching economics (e.g., professors versus teaching assistants, larger versus smaller class sizes, one textbook versus another) have the incentives to choose efficiently? This is another important area on which the existing research on economic education is silent. (Author/GC)",

        "description":"This paper describes the existing welfare system, outlines the problems with the system that have led to its being characterized as a &quot;mess,&quot; and presents the principles on which Carter's reform proposals are based. It then analyzes the level and trend in poverty since 1965 and the anti-poverty effect of income maintenance programs in general and welfare programs in particular. The contradictions inherent in the goals of eliminating poverty and reforming welfare are discussed and are analyzed with reference to the proposed Program for Better Jobs and Income. It is concluded that if poverty is to be eliminated, there must be a greater emphasis on increasing the employment or social insurance income, rather than the welfare income, of the poor.

After briefly describing the program graduates, the next chapter presents the master's projects written by graduates, staff perceptions of the graduates as students, and the results of a program evaluation survey of graduates. Chapter 3 on community outcome analysis covers health needs and community change. The next chapter, which is the development of a  community-oriented health record (recordkeeping system), discusses the development of forms (includes form samples) to facilitate community intervention and evaluation. The results of a preliminary study concerning the effect of a nine-month learning experience on students' attitudes toward working in the community and with community groups are reported in chapter 5. The last chapter summarizes the opinions of a panel of experts who reviewed the CNP program. Course descriptions for CNP seminars and the graduate evaluation questionnaire are appended. (EM)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the Community College Occupational Programs Evaluation System (COPES) in assessing program areas in California community colleges. The demonstration concentrated on two program areas, administration of justice and business occupations, and a statewide sample of eight colleges (a total of twenty-five schools participated) was selected for each of these two areas. From an analysis of information supplied by the schools, self-studies, and validation visits, it was possible to identify statewide strengths, weaknesses, critical needs for improvement, and inservice training needs. In the area of administration of justice the program's strength was found in the high degree of competency among the instructors while  in the business occupations area it was in the facilities and equipment. Both areas were assessed as needing inservice education for faculty to provide adequate and up-to-date information on the labor market. All twenty-five colleges rated COPES' application to program areas favorably. The most often noted criticism was the brevity of validation visits; other areas in need of improvement were found to include interviewing techniques, reporting, and the writing of evaluation instruments. (Tables provide the ratings of COPES items for the two program areas while the appendixes contain rankings of program area needs and reactions by validation teams and by professionals at cooperating colleges to the use of COPES.)

The alternative standard, Standard 2, required the student to earn a raw score of thirty-four or above on the American College Testing-Adult Performance Level Survey (ACT-APL Survey) with a minimum of 10.0 in each CAT subject area. Students were pretested on the CAT and ACT-APL. A control group received instruction in a traditional adult education program; the experimental group was taught through an APL-based program.  The study compares the percentage of students initially qualifying for GED through Standards 1 and 2. Percentages of students initially qualifying who actually took and passed the GED were also compared. Of the initial Standard 1 recommendations, 89% passed the GED; of those recommended through Standard 2, 97% passed. Ninety percent of the persons who qualified for GED testing by alternative and not traditional criteria were able to pass the test. APL instruction and criteria allowed a higher percentage of students to remain in an adult education program and attain a high school equivalency diploma. (Author/CSS)",

Additionally, information about the adequacy of existing training resources was obtained. A checklist sent to 884 large and medium state and local jurisdictions requested information concerning the proportion of staff needing training, the level of training required, the adequacy of training now available, and the priority of training needs in each of 25 subject areas. A total of 453 (51.2%) usable returns were received. The data showed that relatively few jurisdictions consider their present training resources adequate in any of the subject areas. Many reported that most or all of their examination staff require training in areas  of medium or high priority. When these factors were considered in combination, the greatest needs for training were in the areas of rating training and experience, legal regulations for selection, oral examining, and job-element examining. The distribution of training needs among the twenty-five subject areas did not vary much between large and medium jurisdictions. While more jurisdictions reported a greater need for basic than for refresher training, still more perceived a need for both. (Author/EM)",

The responses, which were analyzed according to sex, level of study, and year of birth showed that considerably more men than women  had jobs; students studying at levels 4, 5 and 6 were more likely to have had jobs than students studying at levels 1, 2 and 3; and the older the students, the more likely they were to have had jobs.

The 200 workshop participants included state directors of adult education, other state staff, university personnel, local project directors, and federal education staff. The first section of the report presents workshop participants' responses to the charges. For example, in a call for a definition, CBAE is described as a performance-based process leading to demonstrated mastery of basic/life skills necessary for the individual to function proficiently in society. Other charges concern competency needs' state and federal legislation, etc. Section 2 reviews CBAE research and  activities. The importance of the Adult Performance Level Study, which measured the degree of adults' competency, is emphasized. Several resulting studies to identify needs and/or competencies are examined. Also contained are reports on the provision and/or effect of CBAE instruction. Conclusions and recommendations are provided. Section 3 analyzes results of a Delphi survey of State Adult Education Directors and the U.S. Office of Education Division of Adult Education persons. The instrument focused on eleven issues. For example, issue 1 employs nine items to ascertain how CBAE relates to reaching least educated adults. Responses reflecting consensus are outlined. (CSS)",

The studies were made simultaneously during the period from September 1976 through October 1977. Different materials were compared in terms of student performance, student acceptance of materials, course completion time, and relative performance of students with differing reading abilities. In each study innovative textual materials were compared to materials already in field use. The first study involved a three-way comparison of conventional materials, texts in the behavioral objective format (BOF), and an innovative modular BOF version of an apprentice-material facilities course. The second study compared a BOF version of a food-service specialists course with a  version using the innovative high impact graphic technique. Findings for the conventional materials used in the first study were inconclusive, while in both studies each innovative concept proved to be more effective and was better accepted than each respective BOF version.

This is followed by examples of ways in which particular local chambers of commerce have been actively engaged in community career education efforts. Focus of these examples is on helping teachers gain experience in industry, coordinating the collaborative efforts of schools and business/labor/industry, and communicating the career education concept to the community.

Five questions were investigated: (1) What tasks were performed and what relative percent of time was spent doing these tasks?; (2) When did coordinators learn to do the tasks they do and when did they feel these tasks should have been learned?; (3) How important to coordinators were the tasks which they performed?; (4) Would coordinators use teacher aides and if so, would this innovation result in a potential increase in vocational cooperative course enrollment?; and (5) What tasks are common to all of the program areas? A list of 211 tasks was compiled, validated, and printed in a questionnaire administered to cooperative coordinators in statewide inservice meetings during  the summer of 1977. From 1,510 instruments received, 1,412 usable questionnaires were analyzed. Major findings include these: all 211 tasks were reported to have been performed by one or more vocational cooperative coordinators; 43% of their time was spent on clerical, youth leadership, and out-of-class coordination activities; the most important tasks appeared to be those requiring a high degree of communication skills; coordinators believed that most tasks should be learned by personnel before being hired or in a certification course; a majority of coordinators reported they could use a teacher aide part of the time; and tasks were not performed with significant difference among program areas.

The enrollment of women of age eighteen and over in noncollegiate postsecondary schools in October, 1976, was almost equal to that of men. When enrollments are examined by age and labor force participation, differences between men and women become apparent. For eighteen- to twenty-one-year-olds, the number of women participating in vocational education greatly exceeded that of men, while the participation rate of women of age twenty-two to thirty-four was considerably below that of men. Women enrolled full-time were primarily in the younger age groups, while the part-time women students  were concentrated in the older age groups. Comparing women to men students, sixty percent of the women versus eight-three percent of the men held jobs, seven percent of the women and men were unemployed and looking for work, and thirty-three percent of the women versus ten percent of the men were not in the labor force. Seventy-four percent of the employed women students and ninety percent of the employed men students were full-time workers. Most vocational students (fifty-one percent) had completed high school and thirty-nine percent had some college experience. (EM)",

The report's focus is on two central issues: consumer sovereignty and patterns of personal, industrial, and national resource allocation. The first of four chapters explores the concept of consumer sovereignty and the conditions under which it is obtained. Also there is an attempt to clarify the manner in which advertising can facilitate or hinder the functioning of the private market system in the interests of society as a whole. In chapter 2 there is an examination of the indirect effects on consumers that advertising has been seen to have by causing shifts in various patterns of industrial,  family, and national resource allocations. Chapter 3 discusses broader social implications of advertising as it impacts especially through television and corporate-sponsored advertising on our social and political lives. The final chapter highlights major findings of the previous chapters as they pertain to the possible content of consumer education programs. A bibliography is included. (CSS)",

Family breakdown and the financial burdens which come with single-parenting are forcing women to enter the job market for the first time or in a new way. Even in two-parent families, economic constraints are demanding that wives as well as husbands work full-time. Too many women will experience discouragement as they enter work or change their expectations of it. This is true particularly for women who: (1) are from low-income backgrounds; (2) are entering work after or as a result of personal trauma (divorce, widowhood); (3) are entering work without the credentials of higher education; and/or (4) have life experiences which are traditionally female. For such women gratifying work is not easily found. Moreover, the human  services upon which these women rely for new access to work have not provided advocacy for social change, but have often limited the search for new careers by the denial of critical support systems. The New Careers in Mental Health program described in this document was established in 1973 to address these concerns. It involves developing innovative Associate and Bachelor level education programs which enable the combination of full employment in human service and full-time participation in higher education.

Results are not considered generalized, but should be regarded as 49 case studies. Although some of the findings were consistent with traditional images (juvenile offender transformed into professional criminal), the dominant finding was diversity, both in offenders' personalities and in their conduct. A key conclusion is that many of the traditional assumptions about the development of habitual offenders need to be reconsidered and restudied. (Author/JLL)",

The problems women face are complex and have roots in the conflicting views of women's worth, woman's place as well as the time overloads of role demands and the conflict in the priority system. The maintenance of ambivalence, of cross-pressures, the double binding of women, the manipulation of rewards and punishments all create a system of social control which has served to undermine women's equal participation in society. Women are not only not rewarded but also not punished in their professional lives the same way that men are. It is only by keeping alert to the hidden agendas and to the sabotage in both macro- and  micro-interactions that women can do their job of work without having to figure their way out of mazes.

One hundred and sixty (160) White, Black, Chicano, and Asian-American boys and girls from kindergarten, second, third, fourth, and sixth grades freely described the situation that most strongly aroused each of these five emotions. Verbatim responses about situations were categorized in a specially devised coding system along four major dimensions: initiating agent, the social context, the personal resources gained or lost, and the specific need threatened or satisfied in the emotion arousing event. Although significant developmental and inter-emotional differences were found, only limited sex differences were obtained. In  general, girls more than boys experienced critical emotional experiences in family and social contexts, while boys were more self-oriented, manifesting greater preoccupations with possessions, competence, and autonomy. These limited sex differences, found within a wider context of similarity, were interpreted in the context of Bakan's communal/agency distinction. Each emotion studied reflected different configurations among the four dimensions analyzed, suggesting unique developmental patterns of emergence for the separate emotions. (Author)",

New analyses of existing data sets indicate that becoming an out-of-wedlock parent is a process with three stages: commencement of sexual activity; conception among the sexually active; and pregnancy outcome among those who conceive. Public policy variables such as AFDC benefits, family planning services and abortion availability did not increase the likelihood of sexual intercourse. Teenagers were found likely to make the transition as they become older, if their fathers were poorly educated; if (among non-blacks) they lived on the Pacific Coast; if they were black; and if they were from a more recent birth cohort or a non-intact family. The examination of data regarding pregnancy among the group who were  sexually experienced indicated that AFDC benefits did not serve as an economic incentive to childbearing outside of marriage. On the other hand, the impact of liberal family planning and abortion policies is cited in reducing the incidence of out-of-wedlock childbearing. (BN)",

Results analyzed with a t-test and analysis of variance indicated that the majority of attributions were team attributions; athlete attributions were unstable with great use of effort and mood attributions; female  athletes tended to attribute their outcomes differently from male athletes; college athletes tended to be more loyal to their teams than non-athletes; and sex differences in attributional patterns tended to override the factor of being an athlete. Results suggested that college athletes do not have strong differences from other college students in the way they view sports; rather, the major differences are between men and women. (KA)",

It was hypothesized that affection in the family would affect the amount of self-disclosure of subjects to parents and people outside the family, and that there would be a curvilinear relationship between the degree of parental control and self-disclosure, with families in which parents and adolescents make decisions together (democratic) more conducive to self-disclosure than families in which decisions are made by parents alone (autocratic) or adolescents alone (permissive). Subjects were recruited from two groups: 13 male and 44 female high school students and 41 college students participated in the study. Subjects were interviewed individually using a modified  Jourard Self-Disclosure Questionnaire and a Likert format questionnaire. Results revealed that parental affection significantly affected self-disclosure, and that degree of participation in the family has an important effect upon self-disclosure. It was suggested that self-disclosure be placed in a developmental framework, and that the structure and child rearing practices of the family definitely influence self-disclosure by providing a model for interpersonal relationships.

In the current study 88 subjects were assigned to one of four intervention groups. Group A received a letter three days prior to initial appointment; group B received a telephone call three days prior to initial appointment; group C received a telephone call one day prior to initial appointment; group D was a control. The content of the telephone call and letter were identical. Subjects were reminded of date and time of appointment and name of  worker. The results showed a significant reduction in the rate of failed initial appointments. In Group C, 91% of subjects kept the initial appointments; in both Groups A and B, 68% kept their initial appointments. Only 45% of the control group kept their appointments. The effectiveness of these intervention techniques in reducing the failure rate, and thereby enhancing the resources of CMHC's , was discussed.

Responses to the questionnaire revealed a significant  difference betwen practicing and student teachers about corporal punishment, with student teachers opposing it and practicing teachers favoring its use.

Given two divergent cultures the children face conflicts over cultural values accepted and cultural communities embraced. Some of these possible conflicts are examined. Twenty-nine college age males and females of Eurasian extraction were interviewed and given Gough's (1952) Adjective Check List. They were found to identify more often as Caucasians than Asians. This identification, however, was influenced by the ethnicity of the neighborhood in which they were raised. A large proportion of Eurasians did not see themselves as a part of the neighborhood's majority culture. This feeling of  minority status may partly explain the Eurasian's description of themselves as being sensitive, cautious, dependable, and honest. Also of interest were attitudes towards interracial marriages. While Asian-Caucasian marriages were approved of in general, the Asian female-Caucasian male pairing was more desirable than was the Asian male-Caucasian female pairing. These findings reflect some of the Eurasian's internal conflicts. Areas of concern include identity, self concept, sense of belonging, and social attitudes. (Author)",

An intervention package, consisting of social skills tutoring and a recess-based point system, was alternated with treatment reversal periods to determine whether maintenance effects would accumulate with repeated exposure to treatment procedures.

Ryder, and Roger C. Googins (see related documents). The suggestions are as follows: (1) A comprehensive program must deal with all students who need help; thus, there should be a content area program, a remedial program, and possibly a developmental program. (2) Someone must be responsible for ensuring that good liaison is maintained among the people who contribute to a comprehensive program. (3) A remedial services committee should be formed to decide what special services the school will offer, screen students, coordinate ongoing programs, and evaluate the special programs. (4) A content area reading committee,  which includes the reading teacher and teachers from all the content areas, would be helpful in keeping teachers informed about the reading program and their students' progress. (5) It is important to provide inservice training in which content area teachers can learn about specific procedures for developing students' reading skills. (6) Among the factors in remedial reading programs that need attention are program duration, consistency, and diversity; intensity of instruction; and teachers' knowledge of materials. (GW)",

        "description":"The responses of 108 children, aged five through nine, to the question, \"What is reading?\" were analyzed to determine whether there were age-related trends toward more mature and structurally more complex definitions of reading and whether a relationship existed between reading skill and the ability to formulate a definition of reading. The Reading subtest of the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) was also administered to each child as a measure of reading skill. Results showed that there were differences by age and grade level in maturity of definition (as measured in terms of inclusion of critical elements of word recognition and meaning) and in structural complexity (as defined by number of facets of reading specified). A significant positive relationship was found between  reading skill as measured by the WRAT and complexity of definition. These findings were supported in a second study involving 36 children in kindergarten through grade two and in a reanalysis of earlier research data. (FL)",

Among the findings were that practically no comprehension instruction was seen but that comprehension assessment, usually carried on through interrogation, was common; that other kinds of reading instruction were not seen with any frequency; that in addition to being interrogators, teachers also appeared to be assignment-givers, spending a large part of the observed periods on giving and checking assignments; that sizeable amounts of time went to activities categorized as &quot;transition&quot; and &quot;noninstruction&quot;; and that teachers did not see the social studies period  as a time to improve children's comprehension abilities, but instead were concerned about covering content and having children master facts. (The report discusses definitions and examples of comprehension instruction, notes differences between comprehension instruction and comprehension assessment, explains the categories used for teacher and student behavior, offers suggestions for future research, and reports the findings of the study in descriptive and tabular form.)

        "description":"In an investigation into the process of retrieval from very long term memory, four subjects who had been out of high school from 4 to 19 years were asked to think aloud while attempting to recall the names of their high school classmates. The retrievals were found to be characterized by overshoot, systematic hypothesizing, fabrications, the establishment of search contexts, self-corrections, and the use of a number of basic search strategies. These phenomena, as well as an array of traditional memory phenomena, can be understood on the basis of an interpretation of retrieval as a reconstructive problem solving process. Information about the target item is used to construct a description of some aspect of the item, which is used to recover a new fragment of information about the  item; from this information a new description can be formed to retrieve still more information, and so on until the piece of information sought is recovered. Three subprocesses may be identified: finding a context for the search, searching, and verifying that what has been recovered is about the target item. (Author/GW)",

        "description":"Prereading assessment was first used to predict school readiness and was an assessment of the child's visual and oral vocabulary skills. By the 1970s, readiness assessment had changed from assessment of a child's developmental probability for success or failure in reading to an assessment of the child's skill development in relation to the reading instructional environment. Most current readiness tests reflect this newer concept emphasizing skills related to decoding and to comprehension. Recent criterion-referenced tests reflect the idea of relating assessment to instruction. This has brought about greater emphasis on subscores rather than on total scores. In the future, more research is needed to discover the relation of understanding concepts of \"reading,\"\"word,\" and \"letter\"  to learning to read. An important implication of readiness assessment research is that teachers should choose the most appropriate prereading test for their particular situations and then plan instructional tasks to follow the information gained from the tests.

Five observations about this phenomenon are: (1) The concept of dyslexia is often confused with \"slowness\" in learning to read. A child who is bright enough to guess instead of read could be wrongly diagnosed as dyslexic instead of \"illiterate.\" (2) It would be rash to use a definition deficiency as an excuse to abandon a practical diagnostic tool. (3) No child should be labeled as dyslexic until all possibilities of nonreading phenomena have been eliminated. For instance, the transition from a special education class to a regular classroom may itself cause the non-reading phenomenon in a child. (4) Preconceptions of  the mainstreamed staff may cause teachers to diagnose dyslexia instead of changing their teaching methods and styles for a child who is experiencing normal reading problems and confusions. (5) Teachers should stick to recognized teaching methods that offer a wide variety of alternatives and leave the diagnosis of dyslexia to specialists. An effective teaching method is to change lesson plans from \"the teacher will\" to \"the student will\" which makes the teacher more aware of the learning styles of a wide variety of children.

In the first, 173 second through eighth grade students were involved in an investigation of five approaches to vocabulary assessment: synonym in context, synonym out of context, cloze, oral recognition, and self-screening. Results revealed significant problems with the self-screening and oral recognition formats; they were therefore eliminated from the succeeding studies. A total of 184 first through fifth graders participated in the second and third studies, which further evaluated the three remaining formats. These studies also correlated the children's performance on the three paradigms with scores on a standardized measure of  reading comprehension. The results suggest that no single format is superior in assessing vocabulary knowledge across all grade levels. Data from the third study also indicate lower correlations between vocabulary knowledge and comprehension ability for the second and third grades than for the fourth and fifth grades. (Author/FL)",

The antipsychological, behavioristic bias of American linguistics, which prevented any study of the deeper mental processes of language production, was remediated in part by the evolution of transformational grammar, although the preoccupation was still with syntactic formation rather than with thoughts and their expression. Recent investigations in psychological research have been more promising with regard to their applicability to teaching language skills. (1) Syntax plays a limited role in the processing of language, being applied late in text production and soon forgotten in text comprehension. (2)  Grammatical decisions in the formation of a single sentence cannot be made without knowledge of the overall flow of the text. (3) The concept of \"frame\" is now being used to classify the shared knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes prerequisite to communication; into this field the individual introduces nonexpected material in the form of news or opinion. (4) Effective writing proceeds when the writer achieves the optimum balance between what the reader already knows and what he or she is now being told.

The paper first posits a continuum along which press effects on reform may be pinpointed; it then discusses the muckraking era, which included the period under consideration, and tells of Lincoln Steffens's &quot;The Shame of Minneapolis,&quot; a muckraking article about the Minneapolis scandal. The following topics are then discussed: the scandal, which centered on the gathering of graft by Mayor Albert Ames and his associates, using police authority as leverage; the way the three Minneapolis newspapers covered the administration from 1900 through the 1902 grand jury indictments of  administration officials and the resignation of Ames; reform attempts by the new administration; and the 1903 indictment and subsequent trials of Ames. It is concluded that even the two newspapers that opposed the Ames administration did not probe to uncover the underlying pattern of corruption, that the papers printed the most revealing stories about the scandal only after the grand jury had unearthed the details, and that the newspapers' prescriptions for reform were confined to the area of the replacement of corrupt personnel, rather than addressing more fundamental changes in government structures.

In the classroom, activities such as pantomime, story dramatization, and sensitivity exercises are most effective when the teacher provides a definite structure, establishes limits, and follows these guidelines: the child is the center of every creative dramatics activity; children proceed at their own rate without fear of  failure; and there is an on-going evaluation process.

Major attention to matters of correct form should be postponed until the final stages of composing--revision and proofreading. Instruction that prepares students to eliminate errors in these final stages should be based on research and linguistic knowledge. Such instruction should begin with helping students develop writing fluency so that the mechanical process can become unconscious. Other instruction should include language activities that  ask students to generate and manipulate their own language, a direct or applied approach to teaching grammar, usage instruction based on current knowledge about language, a spelling curriculum, and information on how to revise and proofread.

        "description":"After a unique court decision forbidding prior restraint in public high school publications in three states, a study was devised based on the responses to individual questionnaires sent to principals, faculty advisers, and student editors in each of the schools in the judicial district involved in the decision. Respondents answered questions concerning school size and location, frequency of newspaper distribution, newspaper sponsorship, and supervision of the paper. Other questions dealt with censorship, underground newspapers, freedom in high school newspapers, and personal familiarity with the court decision. Advisers and principals answered additional questions regarding their journalism experience and training and their practices for reviewing printed material. The results  disclosed the following: only 10% of the advisors and 15% of the principals were familiar with the court decision; the decision did not precipitate an increase in campus disruptions; the journalism atmosphere was less restrictive in large communities and schools; and principals and advisers with academic or professional backgrounds tended to give students more freedom. The lack of consistency among the schools in permitting student freedom indicated that the court decision had little effect on high school journalism. (MAI)",

The United States differs from the other countries in its definition of professionalism, its lack of selectivity and specificity in theatre training, and its lack of program control and communication due to the number of schools offering undergraduate degrees in theatre. Countries that have permanent children's theatre groups include England, Yugoslavia, the German Democratic Republic, the Netherlands, Belgium, Finland, Switzerland, South Africa, Australia, and Japan. The majority of these countries have professional companies where the  participants are selected by audition and where the repertoire is aimed at a specific audience. Many countries have permanent theatres for the children's companies; however, in Switzerland, the companies tour the schools and have no theatres. Many participants indicate a need for standards regarding script quality, the quality of production, the training of performers, government financial support, and artistic integrity. (MAI)",

        "description":"Recent research into the &quot;forty-nine&quot; songs and singing of the Kiowa Indians in southwestern Oklahoma is described in this paper. The paper first outlines the value of a process oriented approach to communication analysis that accents three primary variables: indexicality (the inherent situational nature of communicative acts), reflexivity (individuals' presuppositions about events and the relation of their presuppositions to those of other members of the culture), and intentionality (the intent of speakers). Two primary data gathering procedures used in the research are then described: intensive interviews, led by a Kiowa collaborator, designed to build a reflexive account of forty-nining; and field observation of forty-nines. Finally, an analysis of Kiowa forty-nining is  presented, in which the following topics are among those addressed: the origins, functions,and general characteristics of forty-nines; historical, linguistic, and thematic patterns of the songs; the effect of performer intent on the meaning of song themes and performance; and established procedural rules related to turn-taking by song leaders, the use of insult exchange as a means of social bonding and sensitization, and the meaningful sequencing of songs by song leaders.

Traditional approaches to solving the difficulties have centered on norm-referenced and criterion-referenced evaluations. A promising alternative arises when criterion-referenced evaluation is linked with contract grading. A student may contract with a teacher to do the work required for any passing grade from \"A\" to \"D.\" The process may be handled in one of several ways: the teacher may create and assign the contract; the teacher may create several contracts and allow the student to choose the preferred one; the student may create the contract with the teacher's agreement and assistance; or the student may create the contract with the teacher allowing classroom time to pursue the endeavor and  providing needed assistance. Contract grading relieves anxiety over grades, helps the student see the required work as a whole unit, and sustains motivation. (TJ)",

In an effort to evaluate how well these objectives were met, each participant was asked to complete a questionnaire. An analysis of the 23  questionnaires returned revealed that the knowledge and understanding associated with the program's three cognitive objectives were retained; further, the objective of achieving a positive attitude toward Colombia was clearly verified.

        "author":["Metallinos, Nikos"],
        "description":"Confronted with the problems imposed by the stage presentation and interpretation of ancient Greek theatre to contemporary audiences, scholars have developed four major approaches to the presentation of Greek drama over the past 70 years. The first approach, referred to as modificationist or realist, claims that communicating ancient Greek drama to a modern audience requires a total modification of the drama and a realistic presentation of the costumes, language, and even the poetic structure of the play. The adaptationist school of thought is similar in that it believes that the content and the form of the drama must conform to modern social, psychological, moral, and aesthetic values if the presentation is to be relevant to contemporary audiences. In contrast to these two  views, the scholasticists rely on a scholarly interpretation based on the historical, philosophical, and literary background of the plays, while the classicists argue that the dramas must be read or presented as archeological performances, maintaining all of their original parts. Scholars do agree that the role of the chorus presents the most serious problem in presentation and that insight into the tradition, culture, history, and philosophy of Greece is essential to a revitalization of ancient Greek theatre.

Structural conflict arises out of the organizational structure. Corwin found that as schools become more complex, authority problems and teacher administrator conflicts rise. He also found that structures that allow the expression of minor conflicts minimize major conflicts. Group conflict arises from the friction and competition among groups. Blake and Mouton found that loyalty to a group distorts perceptions of another group's point of view. Sherif contended that intergroup conflict can be minimized by introducing goals that only can be attained by the cooperation of all groups. Cognitive conflict is conflict resulting from  cognitive differences or differences in the way people interpret or use information. Brehmer contended that simple nonrational cognitive differences can sometimes develop into full-scale conflict. Hammond and others found that reducing cross-cultural conflict is difficult because of differences in past experience, psychology, or social background. These studies suggest that principals might reduce conflict by tolerating expression of minor conflict, minimizing the number of administrative subunits, embracing goals desired by all groups but not attainable by a single group, and identifying cognitive differences that may cause conflicts.

It contains five papers delivered at an American Education Research Association Symposium. The papers examine current research on the effects of school organization and social contexts. The presentations emphasize different definitions of major school organization of contextual elements (reward, authority, and demographic structures), different causal mechanisms for school effects (reinforcement, participation, and reference group theories), as well as methodological issues that crosscut various research approaches (consideration of person-environment interactions and the choice of student  outcomes as dependent variables). Included are \"Building an Effective Classroom Reward Structure\" by Robert E. Slavin, \"School Authority Systems and Student Motivation,\" by James M. McPartland, \"Social Network Models and Social Demography Theories\" by Nancy L. Karweit, \"Family and School Interactions and Main Effects on Non-Academic Outcomes\" by Joyce L.

        "description":"Past federal educational policy failures can be traced to three sources. The first is unrealistic expectations about schools' capacity for social reform, about the time needed to produce significant change, and about the degree of federal leverage over local school district behavior. The second source is the misconception that improving educational performance requires innovative educational technologies, missing \"inputs,\" and a project focus for federal funds. Third, federal programs have suffered from poor implementation. Premises about the operation of state education agencies (SEAs) and local school districts gleaned from research literature suggest several recommendations to help make federal educational policy more effective in promoting local change. (1) The federal  government should establish an Area Cooperative Program that would provide assistance to school districts for the implementation of federal programs. (2) The federal government should establish a district-based professional growth program for the purpose of developing school districts' capacity to provide staff development on a regular basis. (3) The federal government should revise the Elementary and Secondary Education Act Title IV to strengthen the administrative capacity of SEAs to more effectively influence district performance. (4) Federal agencies should develop accounting and programmatic control procedures that permit the integration of federal and state (or local) categorical funds. (Author/JM)",

School administrators must keep many important things in mind when retaining an attorney. Hiring should be done by the school board after careful study. Dismissing should only be for serious failings. Arrangements for payment should be clearly agreed on. The attorney's responsibility in litigation should be clearly spelled out. Most of an attorney's activity should be in preventing lawsuits. The relationship between the attorney and the school board should be open enough that the attorney will point out possible legal problems before they occur. Although retaining an attorney may at first look expensive, it may save the school large sums in lawsuits. (Author/JM)",

School policies and rules on the issue should be made only after considerable deliberation and community input. Because of the lack of clarity, this model of search and seizure policy and rules is intended only as a basis for consideration of the topic. In making search and seizure policies, a balance must be maintained between an individual student's rights and the school's responsibility to maintain an environment conducive to learning. The basis for protection from unreasonable searches and seizures is the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution. The importance of the school's responsibility for maintaining an environment conducive to learning is evident in recent Supreme Court  decisions involving short-term suspension of students and corporal punishment. The search and seizure policy suggested here is a short general statement of district direction concerning the policy. Numerous rules are suggested that apply the policy to specific circumstances. This model attempts to distinguish among three types of searches: maintenance inspection of lockers; contraband search of lockers; and contraband search of students and their immediate possessions.

The principal difference between the European and the American community school movements is that in almost all European nations the federal government supports them and takes an active part in their development. The article focuses on the forms of facilities and their administrative organization in Sweden and France. In Sweden most new developments are designed around small town centers. An example is given of a town center that contains a high school, medical center, sports hall, library, restaurant, and a complex of shops and stores with adjacent residential sections. The library, gymnasium, assembly hall, and medical center were designed to serve school and community simultaneously.  In another Swedish town, community and school facilities are integrated into housing developments. The schools can be converted into housing when the need for primary schools begins to decline. The Kulturhuset is an expanded library, art gallery, and municipal services center built in the middle of Stockholm. In France new town projects have community facilities grouped around or close to a shopping center. The buildings and their programs are designed for intergenerational use according to the activity rather than according to the age or social characteristics of the users. (Author/MLF)",

While no new theoretical or methodological ground is broken, a class of models is recommended that appear infrequently in sociological literature, yet are well suited for representing social change. In particular, the ramifications of additive, multiplicative, and mixed models are explored. Regardless of whether the variable being examined is rate of social change or amount of social change, the additive model has little to recommend its use. If the researcher is interested in the amount of change, then a mixed model seems the best form to be employed. If the interest is in the rate of change, the multiplicative form may be more  desirable. Social change can be viewed as a contingent process in which the state of development interacts with change agents to produce a new stage of development. Furthermore, change agents themselves do not operate in isolation, but in a complementary fashion to produce social change. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Values, attitudes, and beliefs are frequently neglected in education for public service. It is difficult to teach these concepts in a traditional pedagogical manner. Instead, concentration on these concepts is more appropriate through the \"andragogical\" approach often used in executive development programs. \"Andragogy\" is based on the educational needs of the student and includes personal and affective feedback. Executive development is intended to help effective managers become more effective. Since attitudes spring from values that are enduring beliefs, values are more critical than attitudes or beliefs. The four critical stages of executive development are self-examination, self-expectations, hypothesis development, and hypothesis testing. During the self-examination stage,  the executive looks inside to discover values, expresses them to another person, and receives feedback about them. During the self-expectations stage, the executive determines what kind of person he or she wishes to become. During the hypothesis development stage, the executive determines whether to change values and what values to change. During hypothesis testing, executives change their behaviors in accordance with their new values and determine how well the new values work in the real world. This new awareness of the relationship between values and behavior allows administrators to improve their effectiveness. (Author/JM)",

While there was consistency within a given child as to placement of&quot;not&quot; as either first auxiliary or pre-predicate, there was no unanimity across the children. Significantly, it was found that three children failed in varying degrees to take advantage of the prospective generalization offered by negative sentences, and chose pre-predicate rather than first auxiliary placements of &quot;not,&quot; even as they consistently imitated &quot;auxiliary+n't&quot; forms as the initial negative forms of multiple auxiliary sentences.

        "description":"This study describes the syntactic features of Black English Vernacular (BEV) spoken by black characters in three black situation comedies on American television: \"The Jeffersons,\"\"Good Times,\" and \"What's Happening.\" Using scripts and audio tapes of three episodes from each series during the 1977-78 television season, transcripts were made of each show and each show was coded for the presence of ten common syntactic features of BEV in naturalistic settings as described by sociolinguists. The results indicate that television is homogenizing the dialect. BEV, as spoken on television, tends to cluster in only three of the ten syntactic categories--auxiliary deletion, copula deletion, and negative concord--providing a limited dialect that does not correspond to BEV in naturalistic  settings, but gives the impression of difference. Within this limited dialect, the use of BEV features tends to follow predicted use patterns based on the sociolinguistic findings: (1) males use BEV more frequently than females; (2) while most teenagers use BEV infrequently (unlike the sociolinguistic findings), teenage gang members are high BEV users; (3) low socio-economic status (SES) characters use BEV more frequently than high SES characters. Five tables are appended showing frequency of variants across categories and use of BEV by sex and age. (Author/AMH)",

Replies were received from 2,637 institutions, of which 2,374 reported registrations in one or more foreign languages. The fall 1977 survey shows a decline of 1.4% in total foreign language registrations between 1974, the year of the last previous survey conducted by the Modern Language Association, and 1977. Registrations declined by more than ten percent in German and Russian, but by three percent or less in French, Latin, and the aggregate of the so-called &quot;other&quot; or less-commonly taught languages. Spanish continued to be the leading language in U.S. colleges and universities, accounting for 46% of the total. The report consists of an introduction, six summary tables, fourteen detailed tables, and the report form used in the survey. The detailed tables present data by state or by region for the seven most commonly taught languages and for the &quot;other&quot; languages as a block, as well as detailed comparative figures from surveys undertaken in 1968, 1970, 1972, 1974, and 1977.

Institutional variables are described using research from political science and sociology to explain more fully the dynamics, apart from faculty bargaining, that characterize colleges and universities. After briefly examining the legal structure and development of faculty bargaining, the analysis turns to the impact of unionization on decisionmaking in several areas of institutional operation. From this synthesis of research findings, general implications for institutional practice are discussed. These implications suggest several strategies for administrative behavior that have been shown to contribute to positive  union-administration relationships, more amicable joint decisionmaking, and increased satisfaction with the quality of decisionmaking.

A single coding scheme was developed for both letter and phone requests for information; all log entries and letter requests during 1977 were reviewed and those dealing with postsecondary education were coded. For the log entries, 2,426 of the 4,211 entries were coded; for the letters, 2,514 out of 3,131 were coded. Coded requests were sent to key entry where they were transcribed onto discs, verified, and computer edited. The requests are described in terms of the following variables: date,  affiliation of requester, publications sent, type of response, trend or projection, educational level of request, student attributes, practical descriptors, and issue areas. Issues identified by the logs and letters are compared to issues identified by a separate content analysis of opinions of educational leaders. A method of coding information when a request is received, entering the information on an interactive computer system, and using standardized editing and summary report programs is suggested. Procedures developed for the collection of data, a describtion of the study variables, and a summary of typical telephone and log requests are discussed, and a coding manual for NCES coding form is appended.

In 1976, the total number awarded was 313,000, and those awarded to women had increased to 46 percent. In 1971, women predominated in six fields: education, foreign languages, health professions, home economics, letters, and library science. In 1976, women still predominated in the same six traditionally feminine fields, but women increased their percentage representation in 20 out of 24 fields, suggesting a general, though small, tendency among women to become less tradition-bound in  selecting their field of study. The two fields in which women constituted an overwhelming majority in 1971 (home economics and library science) had declined slightly by 1976, and the fields in which women were at least represented in 1971 showed the largest increases in the 1976 data. Education continued to be the favorite field, accounting for 57 percent of all master's degrees awarded to women. Data are presented on the percentage distribution of degrees by academic field for both men and women for 1971 and 1976.

Trends emerging in many states include: an overall stabilization of enrollments with wide year-to-year fluctuations possible, both contraction and expansion within state systems, rising costs, and increasing government oversight. While postsecondary systems in the Southern Regional Education Board states have generally established long-range plans, a key issue as the 1980's approach is how to tie budgets to these plans. A central issue to be resolved is whether states will emphasize more quantitative means (formulas) or less quantitative means for fitting budgets to plans. Related concerns of the states  are: accommodation to differences between fixed and variable costs; inclusion of an increased sensitivity to differences among the roles of the institutions in a state system; and the ability to respond efficiently and effectively to more detailed budget reviews by state government, while maintaining budgetary flexibility.

The underlying tasks were to (1) conduct a state of the art assessment of instructional strategies appropriate for COLT2, (2) derive a conceptual framework for COLT2 instructional strategies, (3) conduct a team job/task and training analysis for COLT2 on the Army computerized artillery fire control system (TACFIRE), and (4) develop TACFIRE team training scenarios for the purpose of instructional strategy assessment. The procedures included design and implementation of a team ISD model, via which sample training materials were developed. The materials were adapted to the team training version of the PLANIT CAI system. The results of the  developmental aspects of the project indicate that many of the components of the team ISD approach that were designed for this effort would adequately meet the criteria for a generic team ISD model. Preparation of team learning objectives and evaluation of interactive team skills are deficient areas. PLANIT met the basic team CAI requirements. The results preliminarily indicate that there are differences in regard to what types of behavior are learned between team and individual instruction. (Author/JEG)",

The strategy suggests that the textbook, along with the instructor, assumes the major teaching responsibility and that the computer is used in a supportive role involving information summary, testing, and simple tutoring. In order to develop textbooks that can assume this role, a four-step systems approach is outlined: (1) select a model of student accomplishment, (2) identify instructional objectives, (3) develop instructional features of the text, and (4) develop the computer management system. A flow chart of the computer based instructional process is included. A strategy for using the college text as a component of  competency based education is also outlined. This system is based on using the text as it is, then building the support materials around it. It has been established that CBE systems can best operate when the textbook is designed to assume the major responsibility for helping students learn, and the computer management system is used in a supportive testing and simple tutorial role.

A successful application of computer assisted instruction for drill and practice in the basic skills was described in the initial hearing. The second discussed three major computer assisted structural systems developed over the past 15 years--the Computer Curriculum Corporation's drill and practice materials, the University of Illinois PLATO project, and the Brigham Young University and Mitre Corporation TICCIT project. The third hearing focused on the findings and direction of current research development, and response and comment to the first three hearings was  included in the fourth. The role of the computer in aiding education of the handicapped was the topic of the fifth, while the final hearing discussed education of the gifted child and included a statement in behalf of computers in the learning society.

A description of the general structure and organization of the IRONMAN requirements for the DoD Common Language effort is followed by detailed specifications of simulator HOL requirements. PL/I, FORTRAN, JOVIAL J3B, JOVIAL J73I, and PASCAL are analyzed to see how well each language satisfies the simulator HOL requirements. Results indicate that PL/I and JOVIAL J3D are the best suited for simulator programming, while FORTRAN is clearly the least suitable language. All the languages failed to satisfy some  simulator requirements and improvement modifications are specified for each. Analysis of recommended modifications shows that PL/I is the most easily modified language. (CMV)",

Interviews revealed that though patterns of interaction and control varied, state regulatory agencies and legislation affected the colleges' programs, especially through funding reviews, program and course approval, and requirements for data collection. Humanities requirements of transfer institutions constituted an additional external influence. Neither the socio-economic status nor ethnic make-up of the community had consistent effects on the humanities, nor  did the needs of local high schools nor the potentially influential community-service programs. The most important internal influence was a strong president or board; others included program funding, incentives for faculty and curriculum development, humanities grants, and instructional resources. Effects on humanities enrollments varied; eleven institutions experienced increases attributed to new humanities requirements and nine experienced decreases attributed to growing vocational programs. Faculty, department chairpersons, and deans of instruction viewed the enrollment shifts differently, as they did the role and future of the humanities in the two-year college.

These demands, as well as internal demands for greater participation by students and faculty, call for reform in the decision-making processes and in doing so have created a management crisis. The external pressures generated the reform movement advocating analytical management, which is typified by bureaucracy and the scientific method; it uses a systems approach wherein information is assembled for each aspect of an overall operation and then given to those individuals responsible for making  decisions. On the other hand, internal forces favor anthrocentric management, that is, a decentralized participatory system with heightened positive motivation for the participants.

At most institutions, part-time instructors are not given the same opportunities, support services, or responsibilities as their full-time counterparts, and no research has been conducted on the effects these policies have on the instructors' ability to perform their roles effectively. A number of community colleges have instituted professional development programs for their part-time faculty in the form of handbooks, orientation programs, and in-service training. However, few evaluation reports are available on the extent to  which these programs have helped participants develop personally or professionally. Research is needed to identify factors that enhance the contribution part-time faculty members can make to their students, colleagues, instructional programs, and the institution itself.

        "description":"Tax reduction and limitation of government spending issues dominated the November 1978 state and national elections. What effect the propositions will have on community college financing will not be known for some time. Three principal sources of college revenue--property tax, state appropriations, tuition and fees--account for most of the funds in the categories of capital outlay financing and current operating financing. The manner in which state funds are allocated offers four funding alternatives: negotiated budget, unit rate formula, minimum foundation or equalization, or cost-based program. Whatever the funding pattern, the amount of money allocated is related to the number of full-time student or faculty equivalents or the number of student credit hours. In recent years  legislators and governors have placed limits on the amount allocated to colleges. Especially unfortunate consequences were seen in the curtailing of non-credit courses; loss of local autonomy; decrease in the number of locally-supported colleges; lessened commitment to the Open Door policy; and increases in tuition and fees. A positive effect is the increased concern with educational mission and function, and with governance. A bibliography is included. (AYC)",

A stratified random sample of 97 classes, involving 1,775 students or 28% of the student body, was used. Questions were designed to assess: (1) the type of classes in which the student typically enrolled, day/night, etc.; (2) an evaluation of the process of getting into desired classes and obtaining related student services; and (3) demographic information about the students in the survey. The demographic data verified that the sample was representative of the total student population. The most common complaints were that courses needed for graduation were not offered to both day and night students; that night courses should start at 5:30 or 6:00 p.m., instead of  5:00 p.m., to allow more time to get to school from work; and that registration times should be scheduled so that those closest to graduation could register first. Closed courses posed the biggest problem to students during registration. With respect to expanded student services, many students wanted the bookstore, food services, and library to extend hours at night and/or on weekends. Expanded course offerings at night, in the early morning (6:00-8:00 a.m.), and on weekends were also favored. Appendices contain the survey, lists of closed or unavailable courses, and student comments. (MB)",

Gaps in current knowledge about children's curiosity and implications of research findings are discussed. Theoretical perspectives on children's curiosity, including trait, perceptual, mastery motivational, learning, cognitive and ethological theories, are briefly delineated. Developmental and situational factors related to curiosity are pointed out and individual differences among children's expressions of curiosity are probed. Correlates of curiosity, including intelligence, play, creativity, authoritarianism, anxiety and self-concept, are examined. The  influence of situation and setting variations on curiosity, such as maternal absence, environmental deprivation, the presence of strangers, educational programs, group size, the opportunity to manipulate objects and object novelty, are reported. Findings show that adults can be instrumental in fostering and maintaining children's curiosity by being attentive, sensitive, and supportive of children's needs to explore, by answering children's questions informatively, and by displaying the positive characteristics of curious people. Areas for further research are indicated. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"This paper proposes that local public schools assume the locus of responsibility for providing comprehensive health and mental health services for children and their families. Among the advantages of school based delivery systems are the universality of public education, the availability of physical and human resources, established funding mechanisms and local control of operations. It is suggested that existing program and networks (such as community mental health centers, health agencies, and community education programs) lend themselves to the development of a system of physical and mental health services delivered through the schools with citizen participation in the decision-making process. Current state and federal legislation would require only slight modification to  enable services to become school based. Services provided through the school system would vary depending on local values and needs, existence of other community services, cost, the roles of the caregivers and their vested interests, and the availability of technical assistance in implementing the system. The most important consideration is the need to develop varied delivery systems congruent with the divergent needs of urban, rural, and minority groups. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"The rationale for broadcast regulation has undergone some changes over the years. At first, the rationale for such regulation was based on the concept that the airwaves are owned by the public and that the regulatory bodies act as agents for the public in controlling what is transmitted. In 1943, the United States Supreme Court built a rationale for regulation based on the limited radio frequency spectrum. This scarcity rationale later evolved into a preferred position rationale which said that once the scarcity rationale was applied, existing broadcasters are in a preferred position over others who might wish to enter the field and this alone could become the basis for regulation. In the &quot;FCC v. Pacifica Foundation&quot; case, the Supreme Court articulated a new rationale: the  pervasiveness of the broadcast media. This was taken to mean that the broadcast media have established a uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of all Americans and that broadcasting is uniquely accessible to children. The implications of this rationale are that it allows the Federal Communications Commission to assume a protectionist stance toward regulation that is consistent with trends occurring in other regulatory bodies.

This result suggested that the right ear was particularly efficient at transforming linguistic, auditory stimuli into an abstract representation of meaning. In a replication of this earlier study, 20 college students completed either the task for identical word recognition or a task requiring semantic matching (saying a synonym). As predicted, the structural task produced a left ear advantage similar to the earlier results, while the semantic task produced a right ear advantage. Right/left ear reaction times varied as a function  of both task and the position of the target word. Right ear responses exhibited particular difficulty with recognizing words in initial clauses, while the reaction times between the left and right ears for initial clauses did not differ in the synonym task. Left and right ear reaction times were similar for recognizing words in final clauses; but the left ear was significantly slower than the right ear in the semantic matching of target words in final clauses. These ear differences support the view that the human brain is functionally symmetrical for language processing functions. (Author/RL)",

        "description":"The purposes of black feminist Pauli Murray in her feminist discourse are to help individuals gain self-awareness about their personal and social histories and about their potential for action, and to direct the energies of all oppressed people toward working together against oppression. Murray's discourse is addressed to successful professional women as well as to nonprofessional women; it provides a common arena in which black power and feminism can meet and focuses on past and potential accomplishments of oppressed groups working together. Among Murray's symbolic strategies are the use of supporting materials, including personal references that convey the improvement in women's condition, illustrative statistics, and citations of the testimony of experts. Murray's style  supports her basic purposes in its compatibility with her message content; its optimistic tone; its establishment of personal experience as a valid means of support for her arguments, as well as its transcendance of the personal; and its interaction with the message to activate the audience. The structure of Murray's discourse is based on a variation of the problem-solution pattern. It appears that Murray's discourse increases her audience's capability to act, establishes her as a potential leader in both the black power and feminist movements, and contributes the vital theme of the affirmation of all human beings as a step toward universal liberation.

        "description":"This paper examines Saint Augustine's obscurantist preferences in popular preaching (as distinguished from his episcopal instructions to other clergy) as a way of identifying one of the classical influences on Christian rhetorical strategy. The first section of the paper offers a comparison of Augustine's theoretical approval of homiletic obscurantism with allied classical perspectives by outlining the summary of classical obscurantist theory provided by three Hellenistic rhetoricians and by surveying Augustinian tracts intimately related to his rhetorical theory. The second section illustrates classically approved methods of obscurantist diction, composition, and brevity in Augustine's homiletic models for the major liturgical feasts of Western Christianity. The conclusion of  the paper addresses the critical advantages of recognizing an obscurantist &quot;compromise&quot; in early Christian rhetoric. (FL)",

        "description":"Some of the major assumptions, empirical inferences, and theoretical linkages that underlie the generalization that interpersonal influence is more efficacious than mass communication in bringing about social change are examined in this paper. The central premise of the paper is that the presumed competition between mass and interpersonal channels is a synthetic one, created by observers who reify &quot;channel effects&quot; based on the ways sources of messages, rather than receivers, utilize different channels. The paper argues that people's relative reliance on information from mass or interpersonal channels as a guide to behavior is not strongly modified by channel characteristics and is not a reliable indicator of channel-oriented motivations or preferences. It contends that instead,  channel use is determined mostly by structural factors in the organization of a person's information environment. The paper further argues that the sources a person consults for information relevant to a personal decision are determined mainly by their accessibility and by the likelihood that they will contain such information.

The paper first offers a discussion of the Kohlbergian theory of moral development, with brief explications of each stage of moral development. It then applies this theory to selected United States Supreme Court opinions dealing with the First Amendment to the Consitution and specifically with the issue of obscenity. The approach of the paper is premised on the observation by Kohlberg that the Consitution and the Supreme Court interpretations of it represent the &quot;social contract&quot; stage--a high stage of moral  reasoning. The paper also presents the findings of a pilot study undertaken to test this assertion and reports that of 98 Supreme Court decisions studied, approximately 60% were at the stage Kohlberg had predicted. The paper concludes with suggestions for other areas for investigation using Kohlbergian analysis. (FL)",

        "description":"Sets of photographs of male and female teachers in formal, moderate, and informal attire were rated by 100 college students on five-point scales covering ten positive teacher characteristics. The characteristics were fair, sympathetic toward student problems, knowledgeable, enthusiastic, friendly, flexible, organized, stimulating, well prepared for class, and clear. Mean scores on each of the characteristics were computed for each dress style of male or female teachers; and levels of significance for the differences between means were derived. The results suggested that student perceptions of male and female teachers' characteristics were significantly affected by the teacher's style of dress. Style of dress seemed to exert similar influences on perceptions of both male and  female teachers. No one style of dress emerged as most favorable; instead, particular styles of dress caused more positive ratings of some characteristics and less positive ratings for other characteristics. Male and female teachers dressed informally were perceived as friendly and flexible, while teachers dressed formally were rated most organized. (RL)",

The paper notes that present classification systems employed in organizational communication textbooks and in reviews of organizational literature are not adequate to the task of furnishing a comprehensive and organized knowledge base. It then proposes a determinant-outcome classification system in response to this need. The proposed system consists of four outcome variables, six determinant variables, and four types of communication interface and treats communication as a determinant variable that influences outcome variables and other determinant variables. The paper contends that, as a determinant variable,  communication may be independent or dependent in accordance with the circumstances. In addition, the paper notes that the further development and application of this conceptual model could result in an &quot;inventory of propositions,&quot; each proposition relating to a class formed by an independent variable influencing a dependent variable in a specific type of communication interface.

Utilizing a random sample of school districts stratified by size of district in 1977, region, and percent of school population change from 1970 to 1977, the author sent questionnaires to school superintendents in districts across the United States. Results indicated definite differences between schools with decreasing and increasing enrollments. Districts with declining enrollment showed less decrease in dropout rates. They also had older teachers, and more early retirement programs and required teachers to be able to teach in more subject areas.  The effects of declining enrollment related to instructional issues were increased use of alternative education and computer assisted instruction methods, a shortened materials replacement cycle, and changes in the quality of the program. Staffing, course offerings, courses taught, and facility space allocated were decreased more in academic than in vocational curriculum areas. (Author/JM)",

Recent research also reveals a list of teacher and classroom characteristics that most consistently appear to have a close relationship to effective teaching or high achieving schools. These include high teacher expectations of students, frequent monitoring of student progress, routinized classroom management tasks, adequate student time on task, opportunity for students to learn the material on which they are to be tested, appropriate level of difficulty of materials,  strong instructional leadership, and favorable learning climate.

Results are identified in four areas: (1) academic achievement--examination of standardized test scores showed significant improvement in both reading and mathematics during all 3 project years; (2) achievement related visual skills--students made strong progress in visual motor integration but were unable to close the gap, and only second year  participants made substantial gains in visual sequential memory (gains in both areas were among the younger students primarily); (3) psychosocial assessments--some positive change in the areas of self esteem, peer affiliation, and peer attachment; and (4) classroom behavior--observations determined that students spent nearly half their time using the ICTS and that nearly all off the classroom time was spent on task behavior.

A three phase study was conducted in which visually handicapped persons helped identify mobility problems and evaluate tactile floor signals to identify areas of imminent danger (staircases, dropoffs, and extreme level changes). Detailed methods and findings are presented for each of three phases. A section on recommendations addresses obstacles; warning signals (for intersections, ramps, and doors); and direction finding information (tactile characters, elevators, visual landmarks). Drawings and tables are presented throughout. (CL)",
