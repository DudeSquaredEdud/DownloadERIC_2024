        "description":"This paper cites the inadequacy of transformational generative grammar theories in their attempts to describe the meaning of a given sentence. The author sees the specification of meaning involving the recovery of the particular section or sections of the world model communicated or represented by the sentence. As a corollary, the author argues that sentences of English are essentially representations of \"scenes\" in the world model and not representations of objects. The author proposes a model for sentence analysis which seeks to recover meaning by rejecting the notion that sentences are \"nothing but\" objects and that their \"disambiguations\" are the representations of these objects. Recovery of scenes from sentential representations is considered equivalent to  meaning-specification for language. (VM)",

The paper first sketches the differences between problems of encoding and decoding by a multilingual when communicating with a monolingual in one of his (the multilingual's) second languages. The authors then present a preliminary typology of decoding problems of multilingual speakers. Three main types of errors are isolated: omissions, intrusions, and replacements. Subtypes under these headings are considered and the relative  roles of the phonological, semantic, and syntactic mechanisms are discussed. The final remarks pose questions for further research with a view to consideration of the differences between monolingual and multilingual decoding. (VM)",

Data on nine predictor variables were coded and keypunched on 80-column cards for each applicant to September 1972 and 1973 admission. All applicants who obtained a predicted preclinical average of 85.4 were classified as &quot;interviewable;&quot; those with an average below 80.0 were classified as &quot;rejected&quot; and applicants with averages between 80.o and 85.4 were &quot;marginal.&quot; To test the efficacy of using the proposed analytic procedure for determining the interview status of applicants, a comparison was then made between screening results derived by computer and those of the  AMC admissions screeners. Preliminary results indicated that nearly 40% savings in time has accrued from using this new procedure. AMC admissions screeners have found it easier to screen applicants which have been placed into selected categories beforehand. A 12-item bibliography is included. (Author/MJM)",

The author feels that although administrators are aware of what is going on in higher education, they are largely ignorant or disagree about why the educational programs are such as they are. Thus, he believes that higher education must become more goal oriented, both in graduate and undergraduate education. The process of goal analysis and objectives development can and should work in two directions at once: from the level of global goals toward particulars, and from the level of particulars toward the global. Constant assessment of programs and institutions as a whole  are needed to determine where education is going and why. (HS)",

Such discrimination has been based in the past on the attitudes perpetuated by a man-made society that dictates that women have as their only purpose in life marriage and child-rearing. Such attitudes further dictate that women are untrustworthy employees in faculty and higher positions, a belief held because of the opinion of many that women could not possibly be dedicated to academic and scholarly pursuits. Recent legislation demands that hiring and promotion policies in higher education not discriminate against women and other minorities. Such legislation, however, cannot guarantee that discriminatory attitudes  will be eradicated with discriminatory practices. It is hoped that affirmative action in equal opportunities for jobs might in the future lead to affirmative action in attitudes. (HS)",

A pattern of financing for these activities has clearly emerged today that suggests that sponsored research activities and sponsored creative activity will be supported by social contributions, primarily from the federal government. Additional financing may be obtained from private philanthropy and from state government appropriations. The support of graduate instruction will be shared by the graduate student and by society. This sharing of the cost of graduate instruction varies among the state universities and the private universities. The trend in this decade will be for the graduate student share of the costs of graduate instruction in the  public university to increase. Hopefully, a trend will also develop for the share of the costs of graduate instruction paid by the graduate student at the private university to decline somewhat. In this way, we shall continue to have a pluralism of graduate instructional programs with their varying emphasis upon research and practice. (Author/HS)",

In the interest of examining and clarifying the various approaches to and understanding of time-shortened degrees, this brief analysis is offered. There appear to be 4 approaches to the reduction of time spent on the way to the B.A. degree, one of which is the more usual reduction through compression without any fundamental change in degree requirements. The other major approaches involve such methods are (1) reduction through the award of advanced standing with credit; (2) reduction of the elapsed time required for a secondary diploma and a bachelor's degree by cooperation between high schools and colleges; and (3) reduction through a revision of degree requirements. Such  time-shortened degrees do have their problems, however. These include: (1) possible crippling of general education; (2) a danger of continued emphasis on time-serving and credit accumulation rather than competence and personal development; (3) the anticipated savings may be illusory; and (4) the potential fiscal perils in the private sector are great.

The cost squeeze at most institutions of higher education today has forced them into large deficits. Their problems are complicated by the many tasks undertaken in the national interest at the behest of the Federal government which, with federal fiscal restraints, now are no longer being funded. Higher education in the U.S., public and private, is provided under a system involving 3 principal components: (1) the ability of the student to pay some tuition and to maintain himself; (2) capital investment in buildings, laboratories and other physical resources; and (3) operating funds-the essential  ingredient that includes that part of instruction not covered by tuition plus the current costs of operating the institution. This document presents a case for educational support today, which takes into account all 3 components and their implication for the future. (Author/HS)",

Enrichment analysis shows not only the rate of increase in cost per student by department and program, but how resources were allocated within programs. Use or the analysis in budget setting has encouraged a hard review of objectives and output in relationship to historical and projected costs. As a result of these reviews, resources have been freed for special enrichment, objectives have been revised, and better planning/programming has been initiated. The paper briefly describes the  development of the analysis and data requirements. The major thrust of the paper is on the use of enrichment analysis to encourage rigorous planning and beter allocation of resources. An overview of various emphases in planning is included in the report. (Author/HS)",

Now, at a time when the enormous expansion of the state supported junior and senior colleges and fluctuations in the federal support of higher education has periled the existence of many private colleges and universities, Roosevelt has shown that there is a need for private higher education that respects students as individuals, is responsive to their needs, is conveniently located, and which encourages part-time and older students. Almost alone among the private urban universities in this country, Roosevelt has increased its enrollment and balanced its budget. By the time the University celebrates its 30th anniversary in 1975, it is planned that  enrollment will be approximately 8,000 students, that an external degree program will be firmly established, that much of the remainder of the Auditorium Building (purchased in 1947) will be renovated and air-conditioned, and that progress on an urban learning center will be well underway.

Regional students listed as their 5 most important concerns advisement, being able to take  courses when needed, registration, transportation, and how much money it costs to live and study.

        "description":"There are already a great many bodies devoted wholly or partly to critical scrutiny of California higher education. But it is easy to prove that their combined effort provides only the most superficial evaluation, answering almost none of the basic questions that concern legislators, taxpayers, prospective students, parents and future employers. This report first discusses the grave deficiencies of the present situation, and then reviews the remedial options available. It includes a look at the evaluation situation in higher education and some reference to relevant literature. The point of view of this paper is that good evaluation procedures are necessary for diagnosing the state of California higher education and can, when installed, provide an immense boost towards  improvement. There is stress on the beneficial interaction between the evaluation system and the system being evaluated. (Author/HS)",

The relationship between CEQ ratings and instructor's rank, class size, and level of course was examined by means of multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Dependent variables were the six subscales of the CEQ. There were no significant differences in ratings assigned by students in small, medium, and large classes, or received by teaching assistants, instructors, and assistant, associate, and full professors. Highly significant differences were found in ratings assigned in course levels. Significant size-by-level and  size-by-rank interaction effects were found.

A stepwise multiple discriminant analysis program based on academic and nonacademic variables was used to analyze data. The academic variables were secondary school rank in class (SSR), verbal scholastic aptitude (SAT-V), mathematical scholastic aptitude (SAT-M), and the average of College Board Achievement Tests. The nonacademic variables were based on four sets of high  school counselor ratings of motivation and academic promise summed up to form an Admission Index and a socioeconomic index called the Environmental Index.

Within this context, the discussion is broken into categories concerning oligarchy and anarchy, professionalism and unionization, academic policy and purpose, leadership and authority, and constitution and structure. It is felt that much of the present agitation over faculty rights in academic government is misplaced. Furthermore, it is part of a deplorable drift toward unionization in the profession of college teaching. The dominance of the labor-management model is tending to fragmentize the collegiate system into bailiwicks, presided over by interest groups.

The assumption herein is: if the experimental group does at least as well as the control section and is at least as attractive to students when the instructor is freed from the traditional lecture, then the instructor is limited in the total number of students he can handle only by strictures of discussion group size. In this context, the instructor is freed to use the scheduled classroom time to innovate and mitigate particular groups and  individuals in the class. Results indicate that lecturing is not always the best way to conduct introductory survey courses composed of large numbers of students meeting a requirement, particularly in disciplines where adequate content materials are available. Communicating information and motivating inquiry, however, is an important dimension of any such course. It is felt that valuable faculty time and energy should be reserved for dealing with students when the students feel that they need help or are inspired to move beyond goals that have been established for them.

The sample was composed of 1,860 male and female members of the class of 1972 at 5 colleges in Pennsylvania. The vast majority of the seniors expressed favorable attitudes toward work and see it as a critical and necessary part of adult life. The data suggest the work ethic is neither dead nor dying; rather a work ethic is emerging that places a much greater demand on work while at the same time de-emphasizing the importance of money, power, and prestige. The expectation is that work can and should have greater significance to the individual and greater value to society. The report includes an annotated bibliography.  (Author/HS)",

The statement reflects a primary concern about the events in which campus and church interact in affecting urban society. Since other institutions, such as finance, business and government, exert enormous power in this society, the tasks of educational and religious institutions must be conceived with realism about such facts and with imagination about the forces that can shape the future. The three themes dealt with  are (1) a vision for society, (2) the empowerment and the social dynamic required for people to achieve the vision, and (3) the work ahead for universities and churches in fostering that vision and that dynamic.

The 48 predictor variables included measures of scholastic aptitude, reading ability, study habits, personality, and sociological characteristics. Purposes of the study were to establish a hierarchy of these variables in terms of the contributions to the prediction of academic success and to abstract a personality profile of the black male college achiever based on the significant predictors. The psychological and sociological profile that emerges from this study is that of the black male college achiever who is well organized and has a good opinion of his ability to  handle academic tasks, both in general and with reference to study habits, his achievement drive, his writing, and mathematical ability. In addition, he comes from a small town and his father is likely to be an unskilled or semiskilled worker who has not finished high school. The black male achiever is also receiving, and probably requires, financial aid to pursue his college program. The data suggests that he is more concerned with succeeding in his career preparation than the student from a more well-to-do family who does not feel the financial strain during his college stay.

The results of training demand are divided into three categories: training as a means of filling the needs of American colleges,  relative importance of five categories of training, and relative demand for specific training activities. The five training categories are in human relations skills, managerial skills, information management skills, handling current special problems, and further academic studies.

        "description":"During the academic year 1970-71 a major organization change effort was undertaken in a community college in the New York State system. This change effort represents a unique combination of three organization development techniques-survey feedback, diagnostic workshops, and systematic problem solving. Survey feedback was aimed at total organization change-the data collected focused on organization-wide problems. The diagnostic workshops focused on the problems and, consequently, change within significant decision making sub-systems of the larger organization. The data gathered in the survey and in the diagnostic interviews were dealt with by means of the systematic problem solving approach. One of the design characteristics of this project was to develop within the staff of the  college the capacity for continuing the organization change effort-to build in a self-renewing capacity. As a function of this design feature, the results of the organization development program are still coming in. Thus, in this paper some of the major changes that have taken place to date and some which are anticipated in the future are described. Finally, the implications of this approach to organization development in education are discussed. (Author/KM)",

        "author":["Ratcliff, James L."],
        "description":"A survey of the development and current state of community colleges in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia is presented. The data collected generally reflects developments to 1971. Due to the traditional elitism of higher education in Canada, the community college movement has had to justify its existence as useful without duplication of services of either the universities or institutes. Community colleges as open-door institutions with potential student mobility between vocational and academic programs have been slow to arrive. Western Canada has virtually no community colleges if one uses the strict definition of comprehensive colleges articulated and controlled by communities. But the speculation can be made that the idea of provincial service has grown out  of the relative autonomy of the individual provinces and has constituted one of the major Canadian adaptations to the comprehensive community college idea. Looking west to east in the four provinces discussed, a steady increase in developmental level and organization of community colleges can be seen. The dominance of university affiliation also has seemed to decrease moving to the west in the provinces discussed. The concept of post-secondary educational service to the entire populace of the province is also more developed in the west than in the east. A constant characteristic throughout the four provinces has been the coupling of community college development with the idea of provincial service. (KM)",

        "description":"A national survey was conducted of the humanities or general education courses required or recommended in the occupational curricula of community and junior colleges. Responses to a four-page questionnaire mailed to the president of every two-year college known to the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges totaled 336. Copies of the questionnaire, tabulated data, and a list of colleges participating in the survey are appended. The major conclusion is: It is pretty generally agreed that the average student in the occupational curricula is practical and oriented toward his rather specific occupation. He wants to begin making money to gain the security he needs as soon as he can. Obviously, this student would prefer to concentrate on the most practical courses he  feels he needs for his immediate future and postpone those courses he does not see an immediate value in until later, or forever. Because of this, it is to be regretted that there are so few optional humanities courses offered in these curricula. This is not surprising, however, since the community college is still so oriented toward the four-year college or university that it will deny its own philosophy. It still seems to supply the community with what the faculty thinks should be its needs rather than what it actually wants. It sits in loco parentis to the whole district it serves, telling the community what is good for it whether it likes it or not. For a related and more extensive document see ED 065 114. (Author/KM)",

Findings showed that Ss benefitted from both the occupational training and the experience of learning to set personal goals and to change attitudes. The second study was conducted to determine whether the application of Nightengale-Conant attitude change packages to low-income, minority community  college students would increase their grade point averages and retention rates. Ss were 24 low-income minority students who enrolled in Fall 1972 at San Jose City College and were awarded California Extended Opportunity Program grants in aid. Tapes were checked in and out by student supervisors; little, if any, effort was made to discuss with students ideas on the tapes. Results showed that the GPA and retention rates of these students were higher than the GPA and retention rates of the comparable control group. (KM)",

        "description":"This study was designed to evaluate an innovative junior college program for honor students at Grand View College, Des Moines, Iowa. The &quot;Three-Year Program for Superior Students&quot; began in 1970 as an experiment in inter-institutional cooperation with selected four-year institutions in Iowa. Students admitted to the program have been able to take their junior year, in certain major areas of study, at the junior college. Transfer to the cooperating senior institutions has been achieved with no loss of credit. Evaluation of the program was made by asking former participants of the program to rate the instructional, curricular, and honors program of the college, according to a common questionnaire. Supplementary data on the students were obtained from each of the cooperating  institutions concerning grade point averages and time required for completion of degrees. The results of the study were based on individual responses to the questionnaires and some interviews, as well as academic records at GVC and the cooperating institutions. The results indicated that former honor students rated GVC very high in terms of curricular and instructional services. The honors program, however, drew criticism in terms of its apparent lack of academic orientation. It was obvious that the program had fulfilled a basic need in the college's total program at one time, but it was not beginning to lose not only its distinctiveness but also its importance to the student. Hence, the final recommendation of the study was that GVC ought to move from an honors program for the select  student in the direction of a three year baccalaureate degree. (Author/DB)",

The Urban Development Assistant Project began in September 1964 and concluded in September 1969. A total of 145 students enrolled in the program. This report summarizes the five-year program in five parts, as follows: Part 1. The Curriculum; Part II. The Program; Part III. The Student; Part IV. Evaluation; and Part V. Conclusions and Recommendations. From an analysis of the project, it is concluded that: (1) there is a continuing local and national need for aides to professional planning and housing agency staff members; (2) the Urban Development Assistant curriculum offers a sufficiently  comprehensive educational base from which an agency staff member or high school graduate may progress as a productive employee of an urban development office and/or may continue his education in a four-year college, if he so desires; and (3) the career preparation curriculum lends itself to adaptation to meet the particular requirements of local communities and is serving as a model for the development and operation of an ever-increasing number of urban career-oriented instructional programs.

These colleges have a total full-time faculty of 991, of which 264 are women. Four of the colleges have 26% women instructors, one has 24%, and one has 30%. Of the 264 women faculty, 94 teach in the vocational division, notably in the specialities of cosmetology, nursing, and clerical studies, whereas only 133 of the 727 male instructors teach vocational subjects. The breakdown of women instructors in other segments of the faculty is: Physical Education 20, Non-teaching 33, and Arts and Sciences 117. Of the total of 133 persons in the six colleges who are employed in the non-teaching areas, there are only 9 women librarians, 16 women  counselors although the student body is 39% female, and 5 women administrators, who are not in key policy-making positions. A qualified pool of women is assumed to exist as approximately 34% of the master's degrees awarded locally were awarded to women. However, it was found that practices used to recruit faculty resulted in discrimination against women. Proper and possible remedies to the problem are provided. It is concluded that the discrimination, once discovered, should be corrected as it jeopardizes the quality of education for women students, equality of employment opportunity for women instructors, and the legal and ethical position of the community colleges. Notes and a copy of a letter sent to the California Fair Employment Practices Commission are provided. (DB)",

To test this hypothesis, a test was carried out on self-citations in three journals in different scientific disciplines. The results show a considerable degree of concentration, though it differs from journal to journal. The relationship of self-citations as indicators of use is discussed, and a comparison was made with citations to the same journals in &quot;Science Citation Index.&quot; The papers that were most frequently cited were different at different periods. The data also provided an opportunity to compare  synchronous and diachronous obsolescence. Their differences are discussed and the latter is shown to depend on more variables than the former, but differences between the two were not demonstrable. Obsolescence rates were measured as the annual rate of decay in the probability that any one paper of a given age would be cited in any one paper in the same journal of a given year. (Author/NH)",

The system is a key to some of the answers to problems that practitioners face today.

RIS contains, in printed copy and in microfiche, the final reports of all SRS research projects as well as abstracts of those reports and a general index. The system has  been evaluated and field tested throughout the United States. Because of their standardized format, compact size, and representation of total SRS research, the abstracts and microfiche lend themselves to ready usage.

        "author":["Spyers-Duran, Peter"],
        "description":"The steady growth of the academic libraries reflects a true increase in the body of human knowledge. The average academic library either now has, or will have within the next few years, a severe space problem related to housing of books. The seemingly limitless growth of space needs creates problems compounded by rising costs of buildings and equipment. Effective future planning of academic libraries would be greatly facilitated if there were some theoretical bases which could be used to predict the probable distribution of the future use of library materials in subject matters that have curricular significance on a given campus. This paper proposes to design a method by which small and medium-sized academic libraries can determine the relationship between usage and age of  monographic material, and the application of this relationship to consideration of the possible establishment of a less expensive secondary access storage facility. Since studies of this magnitude are expensive, a pilot study at the Florida Atlantic University campus is proposed to test for design weaknesses and validity. The results should be useful to other academic libraries in terms of research design and other appropriate applications. (Author/NH)",

In fact, libraries, by not adopting new techniques to become more productive, are actually helping to cause the problems of the information explosion, rather than utilizing all the new information available to benefit the needs of their funding organization. Because of the information explosion the user of information today has to cull through so much more available data than in the past. The emphasis must shift, therefore, to giving the user the most pertinent facts, to select the information he needs from the enormous amount available. The libraries that seem to  be growing and having less trouble getting funded are those which look upon their role as an information center. FIND, a question-answering service providing information on demand, an associate company of SVP in Paris, can enable libraries to become true information centers. (Author/SJ)",

        "description":"A correlation between recall (the retrieval of all available relevant documents) and quantity of text which served as a source of index terms on input can reasonably be expected. Specifically, recall should decrease as the quantity of text serving as a source of index terms is restricted. On the other hand, the time for indexing and therefore the input cost shoulc be less, thus establishing a tradeoff between input cost and retrieval effectiveness. It was desired to quantify the effect of restricting the source text on both retrieval effectiveness and input cost. An experiment was designed in which the full technical document text was divided into five categories: (1) title; (2) abstract; (3) table of contents and lists of figures and tables; (4) author-assigned keywords; and (5)  the body. An experimental data base of technical documents was created, for which the index term source category and the time required for indexing by category was recorded. Sets of Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI) and retrospective searches were run against the data base, and retrievals were analyzed. Based on the results, it was decided that the body of the document could be excluded as a source of index terms. This decision was translated into a reduction of unit cost from $10 to $8.25.

Effective CPU utilization is defined to be the proportion of a CPU busy period that is devoted to program processing, i.e. the time not spent in swapping. Using this measure computational results are derived for four cases: (1) both quantum and swap-time constant, (2) varying quantum and constant swap-time, (3) constant quantum and varying swap-time, and (4) both quantum and swap-time varying. An allocation strategy that reduces the quantum as the number of tasks in queue increases proves superior to both a strategy that increases the quantum and to the  common constant quantum strategy. Swap-Time variability is shown to have a more pronounced effect than quantum variability. (Author)",

        "description":"Register transfer level (RTL) descriptions of digital systems have certain advantages over other descriptive techniques, especially during early phases of the design effort. There are at least three identifiable major uses for RTL-type descriptions. First, RTL can serve as documentation of digital processor behavior, recording in a concise fashion the operational characteristics of the system. RTL may also be used as the input notation accepted by an automatic translator which develops hardware structural details corresponding to the behavior described; output from such systems consist of appropriate logic modules, gates and other elements selected from a predefined library, along with suitable inter-connections. A third important application of RTL descriptions is in the  simulation of digital systems, primarily during the system design process. In this case, RTL descriptions are processed by a portion of the simulation system, producing a model of the subject processor; as will be seen later, this model often includes structural as well as behavioral (control) elements. Initial conditions and external stimuli can then be applied to the model which, in conjunction with simulator facilities, produces appropriate outputs representing behavior of the simulated system.

Realizing the public library's unique potential as an open forum and catalyst in the discussion of community issues and its advantages as a multi-media resource center, in the fall of 1968 the Tulsa City-County Library (TCCL) System applied for a grant from the National Endowment. TCCL used government funds for a close examination of modern urban problems. The broad goals  of TCCL throughout all three projects were; to deal with the important issues of modern urban life, to provide multi-media information on these topics, and to provide a public forum on the problems encountered. TCCL's administration urged not only library staff members to participate in all phases of the three projects, but also asked the community at large to help develop and implement programs.

        "description":"It is only out of a sound theoretical rationale of readiness that practical educational application can derive. The child gradually gains voluntary control of movement throughout the states of locomotive, speech and cognitive development. Thinking is a more subtle form of movement. Voluntary control of movement is an integral part of learning. An orderly sequence of motor and developmental maturation is such that the capabilities for certain kinds of learning and performance fall along an age-readiness scale, such as language development. It is from this orderly sequence that neural development and the capacity for certain kinds of learning and performance unfold. Organismic growth patterns can be slowed down or supported by the quality of the environment, but they can neither be  forced or coerced. Recent research and ancient Asian theory point to the existence of invisible bioplasmic energy forces that sustain the development and replacement of cells. At the transition between preoperational and concrete operational levels, the energy forces have completed to a certain degree their task in physical development of the head and are then released for the forces of thinking. Premature intellectual learning or the attempt to speed up the stages of cognitive development interferes with physical development, causing possibly a reduction in full development of the brain. Environmental deprivation interferes similarly with the work of the bioplasmic forces. (KM)",

The Planning Structure, Chapter II of this handbook, discusses why a needs assessment should be conducted, the planning responsibility, and steps that should be taken by the governor or legislature. Chapter III, The Data-Gathering Model, discusses basic needs  that should be considered in order to increase the effectiveness of the data-gathering activities, basic information that is available through the 1970 census tapes, other data required (current child care and related services, manpower resources, administrative mechanisms, legal constraints, financial provisions, and other resources), local attitudes and demands, use of the computer, head count vs. sampling techniques, costs. The final chapter, IV, The Public Relations Effort, discusses the purpose of a state public information program in the early childhood field, the responsibility for development and implementation of the program, and information activities.

In the second-level coding, these 15-second codings are grouped into larger units called activity segments to describe the larger activity system which provides an organizing framework for the child's behavior. A schedule also was developed for describing the characteristics of the  physical space in day care centers and in homes. Reliability for each segment of both schedules is discussed.

Teaching focused on certain specific elements of language and cognition needed to solve problems and on ways to use these skills in solving real interpersonal problems. Ss were 113 black children, equally balanced for sex and IQ. Sequenced games and dialogues were used to teach three levels of language and thinking related to behavioral adjustment. Findings suggest that: (1) while all  training youngsters gained in their ability to conceptualize both solutions and consequences, aberrant children who needed the program the most benefitted the most; and (2) training was equally beneficial to children initially displaying either impulsive or overly inhibited behaviors. The finding considered most important is the direct link established between change in the trained problem-solving thinking skills and improvements in behavioral adjustment. (KM)",

The five-year-old thinks that life and death are reversable, but the six-year-old knows that death is final and brings sorrow. Children from eight through ten are interested in the causes of death and what happens after death. Adolescents think of death and what happens after death is fearsome yet fascinating, since they are very much aware of the life producing potentialities in their own bodies. Children's reactions to an experience with death are greatly influenced by parental attitudes. Parents can best help children deal with death by not making it a taboo subject; by explaining to the child that death is final, by not sending him away  during the mourning periods, by encouraging him to participate in the funeral rites of parents, siblings, and other relatives, and by talking freely about the dead person. Children should absorb from their parents the basic truth that death is part of life and must be accepted as a reality. (Author/KM)",

        "description":"Language as an identifiable cognitive behavior must be studied in relation to identity and memory, all of whose structures undergo progressive changes as the child develops. The organization of the development of the organism depends upon relatively ordered structures of growth, following foreseeable pathways or creodes. The processes occurring within each creode, however, are susceptible to certain environmental modifications. Current research indicates that the acquisition of language parallels the development of identity and renders it meaningful. Research has shown that the style of reasoning used by a child is very much related to the language used and that a close relationship exists between the structure of a term and the developmental stages of seriation. Cognitive  operations never exist in isolation; the acquisition of one enhances or potentiates the acquisition of another. Research has shown that the development of the memory schema lies within the developmental confines of identity and language. It is only under the circumstances of the changed and changing schema that memory becomes not more accurate but more in concert with the other same-level cognitions and modalities of thinking. The observation of qualitative differences of behavior at different chronological levels establishes memory as possessing the structure(s) through which identity is assimilated and language accommodated. Memory, and its manifestation via increasingly accurate reproduction of the original stimulus, is an integrative and integrated factor in cognitive growth.  (KM)",

Children at two levels of ability in terms of classification skills were observed in interaction with materials at two levels of complexity during four play sessions. Materials were two related sets of specially designed blocks defined as simple or complex on the basis of the variations and the possible combinations among individual members of the set. The 3- to 6-year-olds were to play in pairs to simulate the social play typical of children in natural situations. Observation focused on free classification, creative or design behavior, imaginative  behavior or variety of themes. A final measure was used to determine the effect of interaction with the materials on classification ability. Results consisted of observational data from the experimental sessions and posttest scores. Non-definitive results indicated replicating the experiment with modifications. It was not feasible to use pairs as the experimental unit, so one child at a time was observed. Interaction between ability and complexity of blocks was found in testing, but not in observed behavior. No interaction effects with age or ability were observed. A revised study is proposed involving age as the independent variable and redesigned materials. (KM)",

        "description":"Research is underway concerning the way the perception, conception, and representation of spatial layout develops. Three concepts are important here--space itself, frame of reference, and cognitive map. Cognitive map refers to a form of representation of the behavioral space, not paired associate or serial response learning. Other criteria distinguish cognitive maps from models. The beginning of cognitive maps or structured space can be seen in the organization of tactual kinesthetic space in the young infant, as a study of the development of thumb-sucking has shown. Data on children's cognition of spatial layout has been obtained from studies concerning how children orient themselves in familiar space. An observed inability of preschoolers to describe what is above and below a  given room may suggest an inadequate cognitive map or a problem in manipulating spatial representations. To measure the precision of cognitive maps, a triangulation technique was developed in which a child had to point in the direction of an object with an unobstructed view of it, with view obstructed but with station points inside the room, and with view obstructed by walls but with station points outside the room. Other studies were conducted with spatial orientation in a new environment and with map reading. Many studies have been done on frame of reference, but little has been done in describing the frame of reference used in orienting objects relative to spatial layout. Techniques are being sought to more directly investigate frames of reference in use at a given moment.  (KM)",

Responses were arranged into six categories--all adult (specific occupation, adult, parent), older child, same child, fantasy, nonhuman, and other. Age-related findings show that the all adult category increases significantly with age and that, within the all adult category, specific occupational aspirations increase markedly. During the preschool years, the child comes to project himself into his adult future. Sex-related findings show that, although boys and girls equally frequently give  responses classified as all adult, the pattern of their vocational projection is different: (1) boys are more likely to project in terms of an adult role in general, while girls are more likely to project in terms of the specific role of parent; (2) although boys and girls mentioned specific occupations with equal frequency, boys perceived the range of occupations open to them to be wider than did girls; girls' choices clustered around the occupations of nurse and teacher; and (3) girls appeared to be more reality-bound than boys.

A research project in this Child Development Center was carried out to evaluate the children's intellectual growth and development in a planned educational pre-school curriculum. Ten children from the Child Development Center were used as the experimental group. The researcher decided that the experimental group of children had to be enrolled in the Center for at least ten months before the child could be included as part of the sample. Ten preschool children not attending this Child Development Center or any type of child care centers were selected for the control group. Both groups were tested by using the Denver Developmental Screening Test  and the Walker Readiness Test, Forms A and B. The children in the experimental group showed a higher, but not significant, average in their reading readiness scores and showed a greater, but not significant, increase in their overall growth and development. The conclusions made from this study is that although there were no significant differences on the tests used, on the basis of other information such as anecdotal reports and observations, it seems as though a curriculum oriented Child Development Center which encourages growth and development helps a child to grow and develop in reading readiness skills, physical coordination, and socialization skills with other children his age.

        "description":"Results are given of six experiments made to test the hypothesis that urban Anglo-Americans are alloplastic, i.e., try to adjust the environment to fit their own needs, and rural Mexicans are autoplastic, i.e., adjust themselves to meet the presses of the environment. A seventh experiment is proposed. It was predicted that urban Anglo-American children would be more field independent and non-conformist than rural Mexican children in situations traditionally used to measure those variables, and that at novel behavioral choice points, Anglo-Americans would be higher in behaviors indicating preference for internal control, high aspirations and achievement, expression of desires, and risk taking. The proposed experiment will be based on the prediction that when urban Anglo-American  and rural Mexican children are placed in a situation in which either too little or too much alloplastic behavior is nonadaptive, the Anglo-American will be overly alloplastic in contrast to the rural Mexican who will be insufficiently alloplastic. A review is made of literature used as bases for the alloplastic-autoplastic hypothesis. The experiments are grouped as follows: A. Cultural Mode and Traditional Choice Points--Exp. 1, Field Dependence, Exp. 2, Conformity; B. Cultural Mode and Novel Choice Points--Exp. 3, Preference for Control, Exp. 4, Preference for Achievement and Aspiration, Exp. 5, Preference for Risk Taking; and C. Cultural Mode and Adaptivity--Exp. 7, Alloplastic Behavior and Adaptivity. A lengthy bibliography is provided. (DB)",

        "description":"A proposed study of the differences in the way children perceive, approach, and behave in problem-solving situations is described. The behavioral measure to be used is \"glancing,\" which has been related to outerdirectedness. Children will be given two sets of two puzzles to put together. On the basis of the number of glances and the situation in which glancing occurs, the subjects will be assigned to three categories: (A) innerdirected--task oriented and nonattentive to external stimuli; (B) outerdirected for information seeking purposes; and (c) outerdirected for non-information seeking purposes. The effectiveness of the children's performance on a concept-identification task under cue relevant and cue irrelevant conditions will be assessed, and differences in certain  self-perceptions of the children in the three categories will be examined. The study will examine differences in the ways the three categories of children react to an outcome in terms of pride and shame. In addition, two self-perception variables hypothesized to mediate the outcome/affect relationship will be observed. Children will be given tasks to perform in which the outcome is ambiguous and success/failure can be manipulated. Three developmental levels will be represented in the sample of children: children just below (ages 5 and 6) and just above (ages 7 and 8) the shift from intuitive to concrete operational stages will comprise the youngest two development levels, and children age 10 will represent the third developmental level.

A model is presented for infant looking duration or pattern preferences depending upon transformation of spatial characteristics of visual stimuli by a developing visual system. It is shown how this model predicts the behavioral data obtained by the author and others and how these behavioral data are reflected in measures of infant brain responses. The inadequacies of a strictly  spatial model which force one to incorporate temporal characteristics of stimulation are discussed. (Author/KM)",

At all grade levels: (1) recall of visual stimuli was markedly superior to that of auditory stimuli, (2) modality of recall cue had no effect, (3) primacy and recency effects were found for both visual and auditory stimuli. Delayed testing (Probe 2) produced a decrement in auditory stimulus recall but not in visual  stimulus recall.

Studies have shown that, in general children from a relatively disadvantaged background perform better on tasks of figural creativity than their advantaged peers. If teachers are to emphasize children's positives, they should: (1) be aware that their attitudes and values are transmitted both verbally and nonverbally; (2) try to enhance their students' self-concept; and (3) accept children's ideas and the ways they express them. Studies also show that disadvantaged children perform better on figural creativity than they do on verbal creativity measures. Results of creativity research comparing black and white children are  conflicting. Developmental racial comparisons have shown that black children catch up with, and in many cases surpass, their white peers in figural creativity. A workshop emphasizing the creative positive of disadvantaged elementary school children is considered to have elicited their \"hidden\" verbal talents through techniques encouraging them to responde freely, creativity tests with no time limits, and sympathetic examiners. A comparative three-year program of language development examined the efficiency of an oral language program and an experimental reading program in improving language development, achievement, and creative thinking.

For 31 cities, expected indexes based on income and education were computed to explain residential segregation by socioeconomic status. It was concluded that: (1) a uniformly high degree of Black segregation was found for all cities, while Mexican American segregation was less extreme and  more variable from one metropolitan area to another; (2) Mexican Americans were usually more segregated from Blacks than from Anglos; (3) the levels of segregation of both groups appeared unrelated to the size of the city; (4) socioeconomic status cannot account for the observed levels of Black and Mexican American segregation; (5) Mexican Americans have higher median incomes and yet lower median education levels than Blacks in almost all areas; and (6) income as a component of residential segregation is of no greater importance in Mexican American segregation than in Black segregation.

Two of the recommendations are to: (1) ensure participation of Spanish speaking individuals in development of guidelines for programs which affect the educational attainment of their communities and (2) intensify the efforts of the Commission on Civil  Rights to insure equal educational opportunities for the Spanish speaking. The report also discusses the status of Federal programs, commenting on: the lack of specific goals and objectives; the lack of Spanish speaking in leadership positions; rules and regulations; proposal requests; panels; and prime contractors for Federal government operations.

Statistics supporting this are: (1) although 60% of all substandard housing is in rural areas, less than 25% of all Federal housing has been allocated for these areas; (2) approximately 50% of the nation's poor live in rural areas, and 70% of these individuals survive on less than $2,000 per year; (3) almost half of America's 2.7 million farmers earned less than $2,500 in 1972; and (4) the average annual wage for 270,000 migratory laborers was $1,830, while the average farmworker earned $3,170. All these figures are well below the Federal poverty standard. The discussion focuses on achieving rural  revitalization through a comprehensive Federal policy which would maintain a common direction in its programs and provide for coordination and cooperation between governmental agencies. Other topics included in this discussion on the indifference of large corporate farming are the land-grant university's concern with industry rather than farmers and racial discrimination in the Extension Service.

A questionnaire was developed for the 100 ninth grade students tested in Corpus Christi while another was administered to the 76 parents. The results indicated that Mexican American cultural characteristics as perceived by 100 low socioeconomic families tested are not in total accordance with literature. There was general agreement on ethnic isolation, Spanish  language, family solidarity, and, to some extent, present day orientation, while there seemed to be general disagreement in the areas of fatalism, limited aspirations, and \"machismo\". The findings showed the Mexican American living in isolation, maintaining the Spanish language, and having strong family ties. He was also prone to function in the present rather than the past or future, was non-fatalistic, had high aspirations and generally disregarded the \"machismo\" concept. (HBC)",

Data utilized were collected as part of a more comprehensive study of living patterns among disadvantaged families. In the summer of 1970, samples of Black, female adults were drawn from 2 rural villages and a town of about 5,000 inhabitants in a nonmetropolitan county of East Texas. The total sample numbered 52 village and 207 town homemakers. The data indicated that, in general, level of educational aspiration had little impact on desire for rural out-migration. It was observed that those desiring high levels of education (i.e., more than high school) were slightly more inclined to want to remain in the area. While differences were not  statistically significant, this evidence was in direct contradiction with the original proposition that aspirations for higher education would be positively associated with rural out-migration. It was further concluded that, except for age and certainty of educational aspiration, family income and subjective income status had little influence on desire for out-migration. (HBC)",

Although the rationale for the JOM program was not understood well by a high proportion of the Indian patrons of public schools or by the school administrators, the nature of JOM funding and recent developments made the evaluation of these programs an inevitable requirement. In April, 1972, the Muskogee Area Office of the BIA sent the Indian Education Section of the Oklahoma State Department of Education a 1 page set of suggestions for evaluating and monitoring JOM projects. This document was shown in its entirety. About a month later the BIA office in Albuquerque, which  handles the JOM program, forwarded to the Muskogee Area Office a similar and comprehensive questionnaire which was then forwarded to the Oklahoma State Department of Education. The returns showed an almost total lack of standardized evaluation test data. Recommendations from the schools stressed the need for inservice training of personnel and changes in the program. (FF)",

The subjects were 27 third graders who had been in the bilingual program since kindergarten, and a control group of 31 third graders from a monolingual program. The technique used was the matched-guise method in which each of several bilingual speakers read different passages in varying languages or dialects. The subjects' differential attitudes toward social or ethnic groups were indicated by the ratings they gave to the same speakers using  different languages or dialects. Major findings were that the upgrading of the speech varieties characteristic of the subject's own ethnic group seemed somewhat less pronounced among the Anglos in the bilingual program and that the matched-guise effects showed no upgrading of Spanish among the Mexican Americans in the monolingual group.

The study focused on analysis of acculturational opportunities, ethnic cultural retention, and mobility aspirations of Mexican Americans sampled by the larger study. The major conclusion of the study was that acculturational differentials do not account for meaningful differences in mobility. This conclusion questioned the cultural explanation of differential achievement and suggested that Mexican Americans may accept the values  concerned with high achievement and recognize the desirability of rewards, but because they have poor educational opportunities and lack affluence, they experienced certain obstacles in reaching desired occupations. Further research was needed for mobility orientations as they relate to class standing. Findings were limited since only those persons who were relatively isolated from the dominant culture and lived in socioeconomically homogeneous areas were studied. (HBC)",

Thirty-five recommendations were made in the areas of planning, regional education service agencies, early childhood education, and educational manpower. Federal education programs and their potential effect on the region were examined. Federal education issues were divided into 3 categories: inequity of Federal distribution of funds, penalizing Appalachian regional education; program coordination; and Administration and Congressional proposals which affect the region. Additional information about the Appalachian Education Advisory Committee was also presented. (PS)",

Low income, high unemployment, retarded urbanization, education deficits, inadequacies in standards of living, and a changing population were identified as the major problems of the region. The program strategy was to improve employment opportunities which would lead to economic growth and general development. It was further decided that Appalachia would have to adjust to the evolving national society if a greater share of national output was to be attained. Since its inception, the program has broadened the definition of its daily operating development, changed the relative  emphasis among programs, and changed the range of its administrative and program activities. Some functional programs discussed were Appalachian housing, natural resources and environment, education, health, and highways. Additional chapters contained the planning and development strategy and the commission as a government institution, which included federal, state, and the local development districts. (HBC)",

The realities of deprivation are documented through low income, high unemployment, lack of urbanization, deficits in education, deficits in living standards, and a changing citizenry. It is noted that the program recommendations must be regarded as a total effort. The Commission identifies 4 priority areas for immediate investment: the provision of access to and within the region, programs to more fully use the region's great natural resources, construction of facilities to control and exploit the abundant rainfall of Appalachia, and programs which obtain immediate improvements in human resources. The major recommendation of the Commission is that the Federal, state, and local governments act in concert within a  framework which permits their cooperation and encourages private initiative.

It was maintained that the growth of these educational institutions undermined traditional Eskimo values, self respect and confidence, and general modes of living. Recent attempts to correct this dilemma using Eskimo legends and the Arctic physical and social environment were described. This paper also focuses upon the Eskimo's future, using industry and natural resources. A few recommendations for effecting change are offered, such as: (1) formal education should be of the highest quality; and (2) teachers should be Native or at least Alaskan and preferably teach in the Native  tongue in lower elementary grade levels.

Five basic curriculum reforms conducive to better performance by the Mexican American are proposed. These include (1) assessment of language competency, (2) the attitude toward the Spanish language of the Southwest, (3) the use of Spanish as a vehicle of learning, (4) the emphasis on oral language development, and (5) the reevaluation of testing instruments.

Data were gathered through open-ended interviews of community informants. Informants invariably described 3 distinct ways of life; data analysis therefore provided for the possibility of different crises in each stratum. Interview topics covered sources of change, family life, jobs, education, family status, and religion. The information was analyzed using a model of structural differentiation containing the following steps: dissatisfaction or threat to goal achievement, symptoms of disturbance, attempts to solve problems through the existing system, encouragement of new ideas, positive attempts to specify a process, implementation of new ways of doing things, and  development of performance patterns. Major suggestions for further research indicated the need for studies of: mental disorders and maladaptive behavior in the community; well and sick families as defined by the extent of social and medical health; crises and problem solving in the religious life of the community; and the socialization process.

The change in the program scope from a teacher introduction to Piaget's theory focusing on acquisition of conservation and helping the teachers develop programs, to the approach of planning a total program which integrated Piagetian theory into the entire elementary program was traced. A pilot program consisted of 4 parts: a tape-slide presentation to be viewed by teachers, a summer workshop, a limited implementation of the program, and development of a plan for full implementation of Piaget's theory. The pilot program focused on  logical-mathematical operations, specifically seriation, numeration, and classification. Plans for future development were also presented. (PS)",

Bench scientists and engineers, scientists and engineers at first and second levels of supervision and management, and senior scientist-engineer managers were selected into the sample population. Management was analyzed in three dimensions: the functions or tasks to be performed, the skills and abilities used in performing tasks, and motivation which provided positive and negative meaning in transition. An interview questionnaire was developed to test  respondent reaction to categories used in management dimensions and to explore their views about transition problems. Data resulting from 610 interviews showed that the sample population accepted such functions in management as reporting, supervising, planning, and programs assessment. However, personal skills were considered as a source of tension. Three types of scientists and engineers were found in motivation analyses, and their identification might be used as criteria for candidate selection. Major training needs were determined to fall in the areas of personal skills and of organization processes and structures. (CC)",

The results were tabulated for the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS) and non-BSCS students separately. Data revealed that biology students wishing to enter college took courses in chemistry and physics. There appeared to be considerable emphasis on molecular and cellular topics in biology courses. Laboratory experiences appeared to have changed considerably from the conventional dissection approach. Two or more hours of laboratory work per week were assigned in most schools. A large  percentage of students took a second course labeled Advanced Biology. Tables of statistical data are provided.

Results showed that a $5.00 incentive did not produce actual participation from a greater percent of the sample than would be obtained if no incentive were offered, that neither the type of school nor size of city caused a differential participation rate, and that the percent of schools participating in the evaluation and providing incomplete responses varied across geographical regions. Greater actual participation once an agreement to participate had been  obtained was found for schools offered the $5.00 incentive than for those offered no incentive, but the actual gain in data was not large.

Examined were three environmental variables in terms of the way each affected reflective behavior in children. The variables are (1) report card grades vs. no grades for performance, (2) individual vs. classroom environment, and (3) dialogue with an adult vs. written test conditions. Results of testing showed that even though children differed in reflectivity within a testing condition, children taking written tests were in general more reflective than children tested under dialogue conditions. It was concluded that it would be unwise for educators or researchers to directly compare problem-solving scores obtained in different test environments. Also,  teacher-student dialogue appears to be a particularly difficult environment for children working on complex problems. This rapid communications system apparently serves to discourage children from processing information sufficiently and therefore from solving complex problems. (BL)",

A pretest-posttest design was employed to determine whether the mathematical concept of variable could be learned through computer programming; a non-computer group of 20 fifth graders was used as a control group. Results indicated that the notion of variable could be learned through computer programming. In addition, three instructional methods for teaching programming were studied. The methods--algorithm-given, incomplete-complete program, no information given--were considered in terms of performance in writing programs. Findings showed that although instructional method may facilitate the learning of programming, there  were no significant differences in the criterion situation. Results also showed that there was no effect due to ability (Stanford Achievement Test scores) in the criterion situation. Observation results indicated that the students developed certain problem-solving behaviors and that programming is an effective learning resource in terms of affective considerations. (Author/DT)",

In upper elementary and early high school years, significant differences were not always apparent; however, when significant differences did appear they were more apt to be in the boys' favor when the higher-level cognitive tasks were being measured and in the girls' favor when lower-level cognitive tasks were measured.

To this end, these guidelines are presented to provide site screening techniques. The procedures described have been developed so that people without technical training will be able to assess the exposure of a housing site to present and future noise conditions. Assessment is designed as an evaluation of the site's exposure to three major sources of noise--aircraft, roadways, and railways. Information needed to make the assessment is listed at the beginning of each section under headings which indicate the most likely source from which to obtain the information. Evaluation of the  site exposure is given in terms of acceptability categories: clearly acceptable, normally acceptable, normally unacceptable, and clearly unacceptable. Final evaluation is determined according to the least favorable category found for any of the individual source evaluations. A fourth, optional evaluation technique, a Walk-Away Test, is described as useful when previous evaluations leave doubt as to the site's acceptability.

Earlier research has shown that children at a certain stage prefer to work alone rather than with other children. However, empirical data have shown on the whole that dyadic interactions result in better performance on creativity tests and other similar measures. There seems to be an egocentricism present in a child which gradually disappears, partially or fully, as the child grows older. Age studies have shown this transition period to be around six years old. Creative abilities and problem solving abilities are shown to increase when mild degrees of stresses are introduced in a situation. The author points out that dyadic interaction does not  always function. In one study, dyads showed considerably less group cohesiveness on ego-involving problems. (PS)",

Identifying and developing educational programs that focus on the causes of the environmental crisis, rather than just the symptoms, is advocated. The task is to help every citizen, young and old, gain an awareness, understanding, and concern for the environment and its associated problems. Every institution in our society must be involved in environmental education. The responsibility does not rest merely with the schools and government; it must be shared by business, industry, labor, mass  media, churches, and youth, citizens, and professional organizations. To assist in this process, basic concepts that undergrid and support the philosophy of spaceship earth are explained together with the means of achieving knowledge, skill, commitment, and motivation in working toward solutions of current and projected problems.

Its purpose is to draw together some basic ideas and pertinent questions from leading educators, the literature, and successful environmental education programs, in an effort to provide a focus and point of departure in clarifying a comprehensive philosophy of environmental education and in applying the resulting concepts to the development of educational programs. Major emphasis is placed on strategy as a means of overcoming the indicated constraints. An 8-phase plan is offered. It involves reviewing literature regarding the theories of learning and instruction; creating an environmental education committee to  develop, implement, and evaluate the program and facilitate communication; establishing goals and subgoals, objectives, curriculum organization, and the curriculum or instructional model; encouraging a comprehensive inservice teacher education program; and developing an instrument to evaluate the effectiveness of the environmental education program. Ideas for overcoming constraints and developing a reinforcing environment are also explored. (BL)",

The primary goal was to determine the level of sophistication of analysis employed by children in the primary grades; a secondary goal was to determine if students could be led to expand their analyses. Drawings and problems were prepared by the experimenter. Fifteen students were randomly selected from seven-to-ten year old summer school students; average age was 8.1 years. Each student was interviewed individually. Results showed that subjects almost universally failed to identify overlapping figures, that the subjects seemed to employ search techniques and that these techniques were most frequently used by older students, that there was a lack of statistical  relationship between age and problem solving ability, and that limited instruction was somewhat effective.

Analysis showed that students with high figural aptitude did significantly better on the figural lesson than did students with low  figural aptitudes. High verbal and high symbolic subjects did not perform significantly higher on the figural lesson than did low verbal and low symbolic students respectively.

The perception factor was contrasted in the design with teacher attitude toward mathematics. Data were obtained from 62 third- and 51 sixth-grade classes (approximately 3,100 students). Six student instruments were adapted from attitude scales taken from the National Longitudinal Study of Mathematical Abilities (NLSMA), computation items from Seeing Through Arithmetic Tests, and comprehension tests from the Wisconsin Contemporary Test of Elementary Mathematics. Sixteen items measuring teacher perception of elementary school  mathematics were selected from scales used in the Collier, NLSMA, and Rettig studies; teacher attitude was measured by the Revised Mathematics Attitude Scale. Results showed that no significant causal relations can be inferred between teacher attitude and perception and student achievement. It was found that teachers with informal perceptions of mathematics taught students who scored significantly higher on attitude, computation, and comprehension at the third-grade level.

The study attempted to identify a small independent well-defined set of arithmetic, linguistic, and algebraic structural variables which account for a maximum amount of the variance of the observed probability correct of algebra word problems. Findings showed that one linguistic variable, two algebraic variables, and three arithmetic variables entered in the first six steps of a stepwise linear regression. Five of the six variables had significant t-values at the .05 level or lower. Six structural variables defined in terms of the number of words in the largest sentence, the logical transitivity of the unknowns, the recall of formulas, the number of  digits in quotients, the number of transpositions, and the type of arithmetic operations seem to account for a large amount of the variance (R squared = .80) of the observed probability correct of algebra word problems.

        "description":"Based on a state requirement that all elementary and secondary schools provide instruction in the wise use of natural resources and protection of the environment, the California State Department of Education has developed this guide to assist local educational agencies in translating legislative mandates into action. It offers a structure and guidelines for developing a curriculum suited to local needs that will meet state requirements. The concepts developed for the study of conservation and environmental protection go beyond the more traditional nature study and appreciation of the out-of-doors and consider the areas of social sciences, sciences, and humanities as well. The definition and basis for ekistics are explored and ideas for developing the ekistics curriculum are  expressed. Cognitive-affective frameworks and curriculum outlines for elementary, junior, and senior high school levels are constructed for this purpose. A detailed example is given for the elementary school level with cognitive-affective schemes and their supporting concepts presented as conceptual pathways. For each pathway the concepts are defined, performance objectives stated, and supporting content suggested. Strategies for learning and teaching at all levels are also discussed. Suggested learning experiences, developed by the Los Angeles City Unified School District for the elementary ekistics framework, are appended. This work was prepared under an ESEA Title III contract.

        "description":"This resource guide was prepared for the teachers of academically talented children in grade four. As part of the curriculum materials developed for Special Class Demonstrations, this guide indicates a level and depth of study which was found to be rewarding and satisfying for gifted students. Because of the pace at which nearly all special class children acquired the information presented in basic curriculum materials, new goals and new approaches were conceived. The orientation for social science was essentially humanitarian, but the content was arranged to enable students to distinguish between what is known and what is believed--between evidence and hypotheses. Although the content of this resource guide is the Chumash Indians, the questions are arranged for the study of any  of the California tribes. The choice of this particular cultural group enabled the curriculum writers to be specific about the purposes, problems and techniques which were used to involve gifted children in the scientific study of groups of people. The first section of the guide indicates a social science framework for the intermediate grades which emphasizes the concepts and methods of anthropology. Main sections in the guide are: Social Science Framework; Intellectual Processes; Objectives; Introduction of the Unit; Content and Techniques; Evaluation; Bibliography; and Appendices. (Author)",

The assumption is made that the formation of students' political beliefs are affected by factors which are both internal and external to the school setting. Data from which illustrations in this paper are derived were collected in two of the West German states from a sample of pre-university students across the entire range of pre-collegiate educational institutions, both general and vocational. Measurements of dissent toleration are used to illustrate various approaches to identifying the role of school-related factors in the formation of such political attitudes. The study includes data on attitudinal correlates of  enrollment in different types of schools, on the relationship between the frequency with which controversial issues are discussed in class and the level of dissent toleration, and on student activism as a socializing influence.

        "description":"This paper is a working model for a new one- or two-semester civics education program for high school students. The paper is divided into four major sections. Part I treats existing civics programs and explains how the Politics and Participation Program seeks to correct two general problems facing the schools and civic education - 1) it attempts to develop a civics course that enables a student to develop some explanatory generalizations about the operation, organization and interaction of a political system; and 2) it seeks to allow the student to participate in the school community for the clarification of abstract political concepts through concrete experience. Part 2 presents the analytical framework that guides the course content and explains how the major political concepts  of the framework may be used to answer relevant questions; Part 3 focuses on the basic learning activities of the program; and Part 4 sets forth a general outline of the course. The purpose of this new course is: to offer students a systematic framework for studying various political questions; to teach them the skills necessary to use the analytical framework; to use the school as a laboratory for practical experience; and to give them opportunities to participate responsibly in the life of the school.

This influence can occur by choosing new directions, new priorities, and by reinterpreting values. The choice is to build upon what still has promise out of the past and to reformulate directions and institutions. Social studies educators need to be clear about the meaning of social studies education itself; recognize that social studies education is for all students and provide opportunities for all to learn with satisfaction and success; and recognize that relevant social studies education occurs in social contexts. Deliberate alternatives for diversity can offer a choice for educational improvement within schools which usually  reflect patterns of individualization, fixed schedules, hierarchy of power, and uniformity. In conclusion, by thoughtful, courageous, and resolute choice social studies educators can make a difference in classrooms, in schools, and then perhaps, in society. (Author/SJM)",

Stated are assumptions that provide the framework of current standardized testing. Questions are raised as to the efficacy of current standardized testing in the social sciences because of the one-dimensional aspect of measurement. Four assumptions about education, experience, reality, and value formation are identified to provide, hopefully, a fuller reference point for social science educators when viewing current standardized measurement practices within the social sciences. The central theme of the paper suggests that, if these four assumptions hold true, they greatly limit the  possibility of measurement providing a universally applicable set of criteria for making value judgments in the social sciences.

The types of education and institutions in each country were listed, and explanatory information was compiled. The evaluation criteria included length of studies, admission requirements, qualifications conferred and the possibility of transfer to other types of education,  organization of studies on a full-time or part-time basis, and any other information of possible interest. Each type of education or institution has been reclassified under the OECD system, both from the standpoint of standardized designation and in terms of its position on the educational ladder by year of study.

        "description":"International education and cultural relations (IEC) are surveyed in the content of books from three areas of political science--international relations, foreign policy, and international organizations. One hundred seventy one texts published in the U.S. from 1945-mid 1971 are statistically analyzed in terms of amount of consideration of IEC; classification of IEC among the many aspects of political affairs; the functions, purposes and effects of IEC: the organizational base of IEC programs; and types of exchange programs mentioned in each text. Qualitative analysis of the statistical findings cautions that the results are limited to those specific books chosen and that such analysis distorts the books as wholes. (A list of titles is appended.) A few examples from specific titles  illustrate four ways of viewing IEC: 1) within the machinery of a nation:state or other organization; 2) as an instrument of foreign policy; 3) as a contributor to the world community and, 4) as a process of functional transactions. Final interpretation of textbook treatment considers the growth of IEC activities, the demands of textbook publishing and varying political and academic climates. (JH)",

        "description":"This assessment of the politics of education is an attempt to clarify the kinds of political commitments of educational agencies through discussion of labels, concepts, classificatory schemata, and general conceptual frameworks which allow a person to bound his experience so he can organize it in a manner that is coherent with his physical environment and his social milieu. The approach rests upon three intellectual traditions which are conjoined in a model of the politics of education. The first comes from the linguistic analysis tradition in contemporary philosophy, the second is a version of the sociological conception of social control, and the third is the concept of ideology which has a basis in several intellectual disciplines (political science, philosophy, sociology, and  anthropology). A framework for evaluating the labels employed in education and the conceptual commitments to which these labels are attached is developed. (Author/SHM)",

Part I is a report of the evaluation of German education made by the examiners. The material focuses on the course of educational reform since 1945, major recent events in educational policy-making at the national level, and some current reform proposals and goals for modernizing education. A summary record of the meeting between examiners, representatives of the German authorities and members of the OECD Education Committee comprises the second part of this volume. These three major areas of questions raised by the examiners are discussed: the need to  reconceptualize German education so that the individual student would be prepared for the realities of his new role in an expanding, fluid, democratic society; the substantive need to reform German education along the lines of the policy commitment for equality of educational opprtunity; the problems of translating policy into practical, financial and other strategic commitments for educational reform.

Some of the ways in which art education was influenced by the romantic notion and the sentimental concept of the self, the progressive movement, and by psychology are traced by noting the thoughts of many progressives who viewed the development of self expression and creativity as the central mission of art education. Specific examples of self in art education are given. The review reveals that there has been historical consistency in purpose for the  self to become an integral part of art education. The philosophy that every child has the potential for continuous growth and development and that he should be an active, creative, self-disciplined innovator still exists. The aim of art education is to develop self-confidence, self-awareness, self-esteem, and self-growth. (SJM)",

Previous research and development efforts to improve the quality of life focused on identification of \"social problems\" and the application of education programs designed to remedy them. Past efforts failed, however, to enrich the lives of many Americans because they neglected the conceptualization of man in relation to his community. Americans felt increasingly alienated as they shifted from a person-centered to an object-centered world. An alternative to this achievement based society is that of a responsible community spirit in which acceptance, interaction, and respect abound, making life constructive and mutually rewarding. Since public schools fail to meet the various human needs, socialization toward  alternative life styles and ideologies needs to occur outside of schools. In conclusion, educators need to focus their personal and professional attention on the problem of enhancing the quality of life in small communities and local neighborhoods. (SJM)",

The report includes the rationale for the program, descriptions of the training and follow-up years, results of a third-party evaluation, and recommendations for future programs. Evaluative data supports the conclusions that social studies field agents can be recruited, trained, and can increase the rate of diffusion and adoption of social studies innovations. The personalities of field agents and the degree  of local commitment to change appear to be major variables in the success of inside change agents, such as the field agents. Follow-up support for persons in such roles also appears to be important to their success. A related document is ED 064 199. (Author)",

Special problems dealt with include teacher trainee  performance, operationalization of the training program, and program support. Implications of this program for other teacher programs call for more intensive support and supervision of teacher trainees, a careful specification of objectives, and provisions for the application of skills learned in the training program. A major implication is that social studies educators can develop and implement accountability models. The ITTP has provided an opportunity for trainees and staff to engage in a meaningful program in bi-cultural education. (Author/SJM)",

The purpose of this paper, which emphasizes quality of life and economic growth, is to show how the presidential reports may be used as guidelines by educators to introduce new ideas into the classroom -- helping teachers to make the  teaching of social sciences more relevant and helping students to develop a greater respect for the political processes of American society. Following an introduction which discusses the two governmental reports in some detail, the paper is arranged by seven topics: Population Growth and Distribution; Environment and Balanced Economic Growth; Education; Basic Natural Science; Technology Assessment; Consumerism; and Economic Choice and Balanced Growth.

Five hundred eleventh grade students from two comparable high schools served as the sample. Two cognitive and three affective instruments were administered on a classroom basis in the 1971-72 school year. Pre- and post-tests of all instruments except one were administered. Two-way analyses of variance with curriculum model (mini-traditional)  and sex (male-female) as independent variables and the cognitive and affective measures as dependent variables were employed. Findings indicated that: 1) Males in the traditional curriculum made significantly greater gains on critical thinking and on vocabulary and level of comprehension; 2) Mini Curriculum students gained significantly on evaluation of arguments; 3) No differences in the amount of pre-post change in motivation toward education or in attitude toward school subjects was found; and, 4) In the post-test Mini curriculum students were found to have more positive attitudes toward teachers.

It was developed on the premise that a student needs to evolve his own value system, develop a sound decision-makingprocedure based upon his values, evaluate alternatives in the marketplace and get the best buys for his money, understand his rights and responsibilities as a consumer in our society, and fulfill his role in directing a free enterprise system. A consumer education curriculum guide, teacher's kit, and four inservice ETV programs have been prepared to assist teachers and students in this learning adventure. This teacher's guide presents an overview of the curriculum, stating objectives and procedures; a bibliography of supplementary readings and multimedia kits; pre and post tests for each of  the five units; and the units themselves. Unit One: General Principles of Consumer Purchasing. Unit Two: Consumer Credit (Types of credit, when and where to borrow money). Unit Three: General Principles of Fraud, Quackery, and Deception. Unit Four: Consumer Laws and Services. Unit Five: Consumer Rights and Responsibilities. Each unit states generalizations, concepts, objectives, teaching strategies, and includes a bibliography.

Introductory material encourages students to approach a social studies assignment with a positive attitude, to look beyond the school library for resources, and to browse for ideas. A check list offers a step by step outline of a search procedure. The body of the guide is arranged according to the Dewey Classification system, which is instructional in the use of libraries and encourages browsing. Topic Ideas are listed within each major and sub area, providing more than one hundred  suggestions for projects, research reports, and reading areas. An examination of the period through this guide offers an interdisciplinary approach to life and the times: the history, industry and commerce, sociology, creative arts, culture, science and technology. The guide is suitable for both the junior and senior high school level. Short bibliographies are listed with most of the sections. The accompanying Mini Bibliography provides reference to fictional works of and about the period, annotated non-fictional works, and some audiovisual materials. (JMB)",

Twenty-two teachers were enrolled in an inservice training course entitled &quot;Behavior Modification Procedures for the Elementary School Teacher.&quot; Teachers were shown color slides illustrating actual classroom use of operant conditioning procedures, were asked to count their own verbal praise for a twenty minute period each day during the course, and were required to prepare a transparency showing daily count of pinpointed child behavior the teacher was dealing with (hitting, talking spontaneously, leaving seat, thumbsucking, etc). As the sessions progressed, teachers  began consulting and working together on group contingencies and children they instructed in common. Group discussions, positive attitudes among the teachers, visual representation of behavior change, increased praise of satisfactory behavior and teacher cooperation were the contributing factors to the success of the program.

        "description":"The purposes of this study are to describe and evaluate the ways in which social conflict associated with racial, economic, political and ecological policies and practices are presented in social studies textbooks for grades three, five and nine. Using a five-step content analysis scheme fifty-eight textbooks adopted for 1971-72 by eight states across the country were analyzed. It was found that 21% of the paragraphs in grade three texts, 9% of grade five and 48% of grade nine were devoted to the four problem areas. The total references to social conflict in conjunction with the areas was 1%, 3%, and 2% respectively. Social conflict is invariably presented as being of low intensity, and in most cases as if it were imminently resolvable if not already resolved. Notable exceptions  were found in fifth grade treatments of racial and ecological issues. Social conflict is consistently presented in negative terms. In presenting an unrealistic view of society which stresses harmony and consensus while minimizing references to social problems and defects, social studies textbooks fail to take into account the socio-civic knowledge and attitudes of children--as well as their potential for cognitive and affective growth in these areas.

The Skill Development in Teaching (SKIT) was suggested by recent research combining two teacher training techniques developed in the past decade, Interaction Analysis and Microteaching. Some educators who have worked with both Interaction Analysis and Microteaching have felt that they are compatible and even complementary. The proposed SKIT model is an attempt at combining significant aspects of the two techniques in a model for maximally effective skill training programs. Skill sessions, which emphasize various teaching behaviors to be practiced, are an integral part of the SKIT program: Orientation Practice helps teachers learn how to prepare their students for subsequent activity;  acceptance of student feeling as well as student ideas is another skill that is taught; also, through skill sessions, teachers are taught question skills which involve answering cognitive, covergent, divergent, and evaluative questions.

Some of these guidelines included a) assessment of the functions  of group leaders, subject specialists, curriculum coordinators, assistant principals, and school psychologists; b) establishment of the principal as the educational leader of the school concerning student-teacher relationships, staff selection, and budget limitations; and c) provisions for administrative leadership training at the university level.

The commission recommends a through examination of the possible benefits of a change in the scheduling of the school year. Several underlying reasons are identified: a) the traditional school year grew out of the economic needs of society, rather than the educational needs of children; b) the traditional summer vacation promotes inactivity, boredom, and, subsequently, criminal misbehavior for some, while with teachers there is a limitation of the professional and financial aspects of teaching due to the summer layoff; and c) the current, rigid school year ignores the fact that children learn in different ways and at different  rates. This report reviews the Atlanta Four Quarter Plan and other possible alternatives and recommends that the Ohio State Department of Education initiate a pilot program based upon a consortium of contiguous school districts representing central city, suburban, and rural areas.

The basic positions of the commission are that teachers should be protected against arbitrary and unwarranted action by their employers but that professional incompetence cannot be tolerated for any reasons. Tenure should not be viewed as guaranteed life employment, according to the commission; it has been viewed as such because little effort has been made to terminate continuing contracts for cause. This commission report stresses the need for physical and mental health in teachers, certified by examinations, and the possible need for changes in a teacher's continuing status (presently, continuing status  ends at age 70, but a survey of superintendents indicated performance decline for teachers of advanced age). This report suggests possible mandatory retirement at 65, with the option for valuable teachers to remain on a part-time basis. This report also supports Ohio law that does not require that teachers with limited contracts be given reasons for dismissal.

The expenditure variables (instructional cost, operating cost less transportation, and total costs) were used as numerators in a fraction. The denominators were: (1) the number of students enrolled in the district, (2) revised number of students enrolled, obtained by giving more weight to high school students due to higher cost of educating, (3) number of teachers, and (4) revised number of teachers, weighting high school teachers. The statistical analysis of the variables showed that a correlation existed between per-teacher expenditures and composite pupil achievement test scores,  and that the three most important measures were instructional cost, operating cost less transportation, and total costs less transportation. No relationship was found between per-pupil spending and achievement test scores. The results suggested that an educational program designed to provide a minimum level teacher expenditure with a satisfactory pupil teacher ratio was a more efficient method of allocating resources than concentrating on a minimum level of per-pupil expenditure.

In this review, research and development materials identified through a computer search of materials in the Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC), are grouped according to this framework. Sections are: (1) Issues in the Design of Individualized Instruction, emphasizing the teacher component, (2) Student Characteristics Research, emphasizing the student component, (3) Educational Technology, emphasizing the mediation component, (4) Instructional Strategies, emphasizing the teacher component, and (5) Instructional Systems Approaches, emphasizing research which takes  a more integrated approach to individualized instruction. Studies relating to the instructional component are located throughout the sections. It was recommended that cooperative efforts of practitioners and researchers, including doctoral students, are needed to improve the current status of individualized instruction. We must also acknowledge and utilize selected ideas and devices initially developed for military use. (SB)",

Much recent research has also been concerned with this important priority topic. Intended to be an authoritative analysis of the literature in the field, this \"state of the art\" paper should assist in identifying substantive problems and methodological approaches for researchers interested in the solution of rural problems, and provide practitioners with a summary of research findings that have application to educational programs in rural areas. This publication reviews the educational disadvantagement of rural people as influenced by socioeconomic and other factors with reference to the accomplishments of vocational and technical  education. The review covers pre-vocational to adult and continuing education for the rural disadvantaged.

Primary sources of data are reports prepared by various departments and offices of the government. These were supplemented by review of the literature and interviewing persons knowledgeable about service and repair of automobiles and training of auto mechanics. Findings indicate that: (1) Two thirds of the auto mechanics are employed by dealership garages, independent garages, and gasoline service stations, (2) Out-of-school youth constitute the primary source of entry-level automotive service  and repair personnel, (3) Public high schools perform most of the automotive mechanic pre-employment vocational training, (4) The standard course guides developed by the AMA and the U.S. Office of Education have national applicability, are current, complete, and satisfactory, (5) A shortage of highly skilled, experienced mechanics exists, (6) More mechanics are trained annually than are absorbed by the industry, and (7) The present system of selection for participation in a high school pre-employment vocational training program is inappropriate and inefficient.

While the project is only in its first year of operation, significant progress has been made to warrant the recommendation that all components be expanded and that funding be continued for the next 2 years. The six documents comprising this interim report provide an overview and  evaluation of the project, the vocational interdisciplinary program (VIP) for each of the four participating schools, and a teaching guide to the elementary career education program. The four VIP teaching guides outline instructional units and include teaching techniques for the laboratory experience, science, mathematics, and communications.

It also suggests that health planning should design supply systems that can respond to changes of demand or to short-run predictions of demand change.

        "description":"To change a conventional, academically oriented general education school system into one whose curriculum reflects concepts of career education at all grade levels in harmony with existing teaching/learning processes, Project VIGOR staff held a teacher orientation workshop to introduce the career education concept as envisioned by Oregon's Career Education Program, which is basically a program of vocational cluster courses for junior and senior high students. Project VIGOR has had two major directions of thrust; the first has been the inclusion of cluster courses in food service, child service, industrial mechanics, and general business into their most closely existing high school departments. The second aspect of the project is the orientation of administration and staff of the  total school system to the career education goals. An awareness of career education as a part of the general curriculum is a major accomplishment, and this awareness has been stimulated through news releases, advisory committee activities, and orientation of professional staff through workshops, meetings, special projects, and others. In 1970-71, 142 students enrolled in the vocational cluster courses and 531 pre-registered for 1971-72. It was recommended that the project be continued with additional staff orientation and involvement and increased articulation. (SB)",

More specific objectives of the study were to: (1) investigate the use of manpower requirements information in local vocational education planning, (2) assess the compatibility between local and state use of this information, and (3) investigate the availability of vocational education programs to students. Critical findings of the study include: (1) Detailed manpower and demographic information seldom figured as a basis for the local planning effort, (2) Only one of the six sites visited was preparing plans which linked educational planning to specific quantitative objectives describing job availability and students to be  served, (3) Little information was available describing the social and demographic characteristic of vocational education students as a separate group, and (4) Shortcomings in local planning can be traced to the lack of a state requirement to pursue systematic annual and long-range planning at the local level and to the lack of detailed job market and population projections. A major recommendation of the study is that a minimum package of planning materials be provided local education agencies by state departments of vocational education. (JS)",

With the increase of working mothers, communities and industry need to consider child care centers for young children, after-school and holiday projects for school-aged children, and availability of part-time employment. The educational preparation and training of males and females showed a great upsurge during the 1960's, and the number of females seeking higher education has increased. In terms of industries in which women are employed and the occupations in which they are engaged, there has been little change in the past 20 years. Few women are in top employment positions, and few have developed trade skills.  In the 1960's women tended to cluster in: (1) educational and training courses &quot;acceptable&quot; for females, (2) occupations which offer females clean work under good conditions, and (3) occupations where job satisfaction is of prime consideration. Of the barriers restricting wider employment opportunities for women, attitudinal restructions are by far the most important and difficult to surmount. In view of these restrictions, it was recommended that employers offer wider job and career opportunities to women and that working women seek and accept these opportunities. (SB)",

Based on the national goals, the magnitude of the problems of providing adequate programs, and the findings of research, the authors contend that agricultural education should assume the responsibility for providing the leadership to reconstruct vocational education for rural people in America. Studies have shown that rural youth generally have a lower level of aspiration than urban youth. They tend to be reluctant to migrate to locations where occupational opportunities are more plentiful, and in view of the declining opportunities for farm employment, there are special problems in providing alternatives for rural youth. Research strategies for  the decade ahead may be divided into short-range and long-range strategies. Short-term strategy for research in rural vocational education is to expedite the attainment of national goals through program modification, and long-range strategy should concentrate on developing new programs required to attain the national goals. Relevant vocational education must be provided those people living in rural areas. (GEB)",

Other points covered include adult education, program administration, faculty, guidance, and youth organizations. A major recommendation is that greater efforts should be made to expand prevocational and exploratory  education programs. (JS)",

Information was obtained from school records, through interviews with students and faculty, through three structured data collection sessions and by followup questionnaires. Practically all new graduates of the practical nursing preparatory program entered employment as LPN's in a wide range of assignments across all types of activities. Practical nurse education program capacity was generally inadequate to accommodate all applicants, and a question was raised regarding the validity of the licensure examination as  an appropriate measure of nursing competency. It was found that a large number of applicants were in need of refresher and remedial educational services, and many needed financial assistance. Related documents, Part I and II of the series, are described briefly in this report, and are available as ED 040 299 and ED 040 300 respectively. (Author/GEB)",

Specific activities of Project B were as follows: (1) the collection and analysis of task data to determine the range of tasks performed by professionals and paraprofessionals, (2) the grouping of tasks by level of skill and discretionary decision making, (3) the development of curriculums based on the task analysis, (4) the teaching and evaluation of the curriculums, (5) experimentation in adapting the curriculums to the needs of  local agencies, and (6) the identification of the need for and the development of new instructional materials.

After reviewing the efforts of this  3-year project, the report then offers a prognosis which includes a statement concerning the adaptability of the curriculum model. This prognosis suggests that there are easier and probably equally good ways of constructing curriculum. Thus, human services may have to convert to regular programs of schools and colleges rather than to New Careers or establish technical programs tailored to meet the needs of employer agencies. (JS)",

To ascertain the cost effectiveness of these programs the Career Options Research and Development (CORD) Project focused on the need for cost and benefit studies that recognize both quantifiable and non-quantifiable variables. It is noted that while ways can be found to average out specific variables, it is not yet possible to measure the variance in relationships between and among variables. Also discussed in terms of cost-benefit analysis are the investment model, the human capital model, and the allocation of resources model. Further areas for research studies are suggested in order to answer questions  such as: Under what conditions and in what fields will horizontal mobility have more pay-off than vertical mobility?

The instrument constructed for this purpose is the Vocational Development Inventory (VDI), consisting of the Competence Test designed to assess the cognitive components of vocational maturity, and the Attitude Scale designed to operationally define the conative elements in vocational maturity. The Attitude Scale is the only part of the VDI that has been developed and extensively investigated over the past 8 years. To further study the Attitude Scale, the Vocational Development Project (VDP) was established to implement a program of four different, but  interrelated types of research, including survey, technique, theoretical, and applied. A data bank has been maintained by VDP to collate and analyze the research findings and to disseminate them periodically to facilitate further research. From the research conducted thus far, it can be concluded that the Attitude Scale is a widely applicable, reliable, and valid measure of vocational maturity and that it enters into relationships with a number of variables indicating that it operationally defines the concept of vocational maturity.

Five antecedent variable pretests were administered to the 632 students, and at the conclusion of the project, a battery of seven posttests was completed. Results revealed that the mean posttest scores were higher for students taught by the two instructional methods than the control group, and the mean posttest  scores of students receiving individualized instruction were significantly higher than those receiving the lecture-discussion method after removing the variance attributed to each of the antecedent variables. However, when the posttest scores were analyzed as a composite package, there were no significant differences between the two instructional methods. The individualized method was also significantly more successful in developing student ability to locate and interpret information contained in turfgrass references. (SB)",

The experimental group attended 12 2-hour training sessions held twice weekly for 6 weeks which focused on awareness and understanding of one's feelings and those of emotionally disturbed children and an ability to empathize with these children. Taped interviews with coached clients were obtained for each aide immediately preceding, immediately following, and 6 weeks after the training sessions, and these tapes were rated on the Carkhuff scale  for levels of empathy expressed by the aides. Analysis by using a 2x3 mixed model design revealed significant differences in mean ratings between the groups, favoring positive changes in the experimental group.

A battery of evaluation instruments was administered to the control and experimental groups at the beginning and conclusion of the courses and again 1 year later to check retention of learning. Results of the analysis of data, on the basis of the sign test, t-test, and chi square test of differences in mean gain scores combind with information from teachers, students, administrators, and employers, revealed that students in the wage earning oriented courses  made gains in self concept, work attitudes, employability potential, and content knowledge more consistently than those in the homemaking courses. Strong impact of the courses on student attitude toward marriage was not apparent, and findings revealed limited contribution of the courses to the development of positive attitudes toward the dual role for women. Several implications for curriculum development, field testing, and experimentation were noted. Information pertaining to course development, evaluation instruments, and student information forms are appended. (Author/SB)",

Three major difficulties in assessing internal accountability are presented: (1) the weaknesses of academic authority result in increased pressures to codify the faculty-administrative relationship; (2) lack of clearly defined goals and objectives are frequently matched with proposals to hold institutions more accountable through certain  management techniques and by increased emphasis on student learning; (3) organizational complexity of colleges and universities often results in proposals for decentralized decisionmaking structures that are not sufficiently aware of legitimate demands for accountability. Chapter 5 considers some possible trends in accountability for the 1970s. An extensive bibliography on the literature concludes the report. (Author)",

As the original bill was extended or revised and new bills for the Korean and Vietnam veterans written, the results of the post-World War II experience were evaluated and considered. In 1969, the silver anniversary of the signing of the original bill, there were again a number of reviews and analyses written.

This effort, the Emergency School Assistance Program (ESAP), was evaluated to determine: (1) overall effectiveness, (2) activities which seemed to be achieving greater results, (3) extent to which projects were carried out as planned, (4) effectiveness of DHEW technical assistance, (5) effectiveness of project management, and (6) the role played by the project's Bi-Racial Advisory Committee (BRAC). A sample of 252 of the funded districts was selected to provide a wide mix of areas according to percent minority, grant size, percent of students  reassigned, and geography. In each of these districts the project director, and a sample of principals, teachers, and students were personally interviewed. The evaluation plan revolved around the ability of the respondent to perceive change in 12 specifically defined areas related to desegregation. Respondents perceived considerable improvement during the school year in most of the 12 measures of interracial behavior. It varied from about 65% for the formation of interracial friendships to 7% for improved attendance of white students. The degree to which respondents cited a specific ESAP activity as causing a positive change was exceedingly low. (For related documents, see ED 058 470 and ED 058 472.) (Author/CK)",

This phase is an intensive study of 20 selected ESAP districts, which identifies and documents ESAP activities that have successfully aided the desegregation process. The following study objectives were established; (1) increase the understanding of how and why local school districts implement ESAP projects, (2) identify special problems of local education agencies in relation to their process of school desegregation, and (3) evaluate the social and educational impacts of current ESAP activities in meeting their special problems and identify any features that tend to make an  activity successful. The evaluation process in Phase II consisted of three parts: (1) individual case studies, (2) comparative analysis of ESAP activities, and (3) survey instruments. Conclusions include: (1) the ESAP activities tended to help the process of desegregation but had little effect on the quality of education in the schools; (2) Counseling activities received high marks by their evaluators for their roles in aiding desegregation; (3) ESAP provided local school officials with an acceptable reason for undertaking certain actions; and (4) The 20 districts included a mixture of many successful and few unsuccessful ESAP activities.

(2) Can the role of each level of government be rationalized and generally accepted? (3) How can responsibility and  accountability be applied at each level? (4) What are the appropriate relationships between the executive and school boards, commissions, and the chief state school officer? (5) How can the concept of new federalism be applied to the educational field?

The report presents statistical data on the responses to individual questions in the survey, and concludes that the committee chairmen favor substantial changes in elementary and secondary school finance. They support (1) increased State financing of education to equalize tax burdens among localities, (2) greater reliance on income taxation with consequent local property tax  relief, (3) reformation of local property tax assessment procedures, (4) increased federal assistance in the form of general aid to education, and (5) increased spending on education research and development.

In addition, a report on the revenue yields of various taxes related to economic conditions is included. The concept of human investment is discussed from the standpoint of its similarities with physical capital investment, dissimilarities: differences in degree, and dissimilarities: differences in kind. Conceptual problems in evaluating educational investment are related to the economist's use of benefit-cost-analysis and rate-of-return-analysis. Economic and social benefits accruing from education are seen as external benefits. Empirical evidence on rates of return is presented in discussions of internal rate of return, discrimination and rate of  return analysis, and the return to increased quality. The question of how education influences the size of a nation's output is discussed as to factors in economic growth, the quantity and quality of productive resources, and the mystery of the econometric residual. Revenue limitations related to economic growth, with particular emphasis on educational programs, are examined as to revenue availability, increasing revenue from available sources, some problems of competing resource demands, and taxpayer revolt.

A common pattern in education finance characteristics was found within each type of district, particularly among central cities. Suburban districts--although they have the widest variations in characteristics of any type of school district--generally follow a common pattern when they are grouped together. Sharp differences were also found from state to state in the share of educational costs borne by different income groups, ranging from roughly proportional tax burdens to highly regressive. The disparity analysis is an attempt to provide an overview of the  existing structure of education finance and the causes for inequalities in both dollar expenditures and resources. An additional objective of the disparity analysis was to provide basic statistical data for examining alternative tax and distribute approaches as well as specific allocation formulas. Some of these alternatives are: (1) state matching grants based on fiscal capacity, (2) equal dollars for equal tax effort, (3) educational need grants, and (4) state assumption of costs for specific functions.

The first chapter discusses the beginnings of modern systems of school support in the United States. Chapter two explains in some detail the five basic distribution models used in the apportionment of State education funds. The third chapter demonstrates how inter-district expenditure disparities occur due to the imposition of local tax surcharges beyond the mandates of the State financed program. Chapter four examines recent Court cases challenging the constitutionality of present State school funding programs. Chapter five discusses some proposals for change. The first appendix to volume one reviews recent proposals for change advocated in  the reports of State school finance commissions. A second appendix contains a summary of current legal challenges to State school financing systems. (For related document, see ED 058 473.) (Author/DB)",

Under the foundation approach, the state generally guarantees that, irrespective of local wealth, every child will have a minimum number of dollars expended on his education. In operation, the foundation program provides more educational resources to children in wealthy school districts and fewer resources to children in poor districts. A minimal definition of equality of educational opportunity is that the quality of a child's education should not depend upon where he happens to live. A recent California Supreme Court decision requires a rational educational finance scheme within the state. Several definitions of equality of educational  opportunity are proposed: (1) minimum attainment, (2) leveling, (3) competition, (4) equal dollars per pupil, (5) maximum variance ratio, and (6) classification.

Charles M. Whelan provides an analytical framework for determining the constitutionality of various assistance forms. He suggests that each program should be submitted to three analytic levels: (1) the objective -- abstention from taxation or provision of positive assistance that requires an appropriation; (2) the form -- money, services, equipment, facilities, or material; (3) the channel -- direct recipient of the assistance (school, student, teacher, or parent.) Mr. Whelan notes a fundamental constitutional difference between \"appropriation aid\" and \"tax benefits\" in that appropriation aid, except in  special cases, must be restricted to secular education while tax benefits need not be. Paul A. Freund examines specific types of proposed assistance and attempts to suggest which are legitimate. He discusses bus fares, other welfare assistance, textbooks, equipment and facilities, shared time, grants to pupils or families, tax deducations-credits, and preferential or exclusionary school policies. An appendix by both authors considers certain State and federal legislation plans, drafted before the Supreme Court decisions of June 28, 1971, that fall into two categories: grants to families and tax credits.

Studies on nonpublic schools were conducted in the following areas: (1) attitudinal demand, (2) present enrollment and projection of future enrollment, (3) costs and revenues with concomitant projections, (4) estimates of marginal costs to public schools resulting from nonpublic school failure, (5) in-depth analyses of costs, revenues, and marginal transfer costs in five selected cities, (6) a secondary analysis case study of determinants of enrollments in Catholic schools, and (7)  an examination of criteria for aid to nonpublic schools with implications for public policy. It was found that: (1) American Catholics want their children to receive some formal religious instruction; (2) Nearly all Catholics are cognizant of the distinctiveness of both parochial and public schools; and (3) Quality assessments of educational programs, and subsequent decisions as to where to enroll one's children appear to be a function of one's personal set of education-related priorities.

Educational trends that affect school enrollments are discussed such as the decline of religious teachers in Catholic schools, and rising costs in public and nonpublic schools. In Chapter II, the capacity of the Chicago, Detroit, and Milwaukee school systems to absorb additional students without new school construction is shown to vary substantially, depending on the nature of the standards that are used to define  an acceptable student teacher classroom ratio. Chapter III estimates the current economic value of nonpublic school operations in Chicago, Detroit, and Milwaukee, based on 1970-71 cost data for capital outlay and operations. Chapter IV deals with public and nonpublic schools in Philadelphia concerning enrollment trends, building capacity, and financial impact of declining nonpublic school enrollment.

A two-fold approach toward gaining attitudinal data was undertaken. A critical review of existing attitudinal data was commissioned and an analysis of the attitudinal data gathered as part of another study was funded. A listing of non-public schools in the United States was compiled based on Office of Education records with additions from other sources. The final list include elementary and secondary schools which offer either a general or college preparatory academic program. From this list, a representative sample was selected. A sample of 750 schools was chosen to receive two questionnaires. A subsample of 250 schools was  selected for an in-depth study; these schools received an additional four questionnaires: (1) the faculty questionnaire, (2) the student questionnaire, (3) the parent questionnaire, and (4) the governing board questionnaire. Like the school head questionnaire, these questionnaires sought data on the individual's background, his attitudes and opinions. The analysis considered elementary and secondary data separately.

The research consisted of a state-wide analysis and 12 case studies of nonpublic education in Louisiana. The eight chapters are organized into two major sections. Part 1, which included Chapters 1 through 4, presents the state-wide analysis, and Part II, Chapters 5 through 8, contains the Illustrative Materials, which are four of the case studies that cover topics of general interest. Results of the study show that while a &quot;crisis of confidence&quot; appears to characterize patrons and sponsors of Catholic schools nationally, no comparable phenomenon was encountered in Louisiana. It is  suggested that the impressive holding power of nonpublic schools in this State may be partly attributal to specific nonracial problems facing public schools in some areas, to unique contributions of Catholic schools catering primarily to black patrons, to a relatively moderate rate of migration by Catholics from the cities to the suburbs, to a recent disproportionate population increase in the Southeast, and to a slight tendency to draw patrons from a higher income strata than the national norm for Catholic schools, (For related document, see ED 058 473.)

In lengthy discussions, these officials observed that big city schools need massive financial assistance from State and Federal governments, since the local property tax as a base is inadequate, and because the raising of local taxes would hasten the flight to the suburbs. These administrators are also convinced that, for urban schools to receive their \"fair share,\" federal aid must bypass State and municipal agencies and come directly to the urban school systems. They also advocate \"more than equal\" amounts of money to provide equal educational opportunity for all children; see racial integration as a large problem facing big city schools;  consider education vouchers a threat to integration efforts, and favor metropolitanism as an integration method. These officials urge decentralization of big city school systems inclusive of community participation, but exclusive of community control of schools. They oppose the use of public funds for assistance to nonpublic schools. (For related document, see ED 058 473.) (Author/JF)",

A team in each city studied the local education board, the relationships between school boards and superintendents, the information bases and communication patterns of decisionmaking, and the policy-oriented relationships between school officials and influential parties. Significant features from each study are synthesized and the emerging issues within the  project scope are examined. Analysts conclude that a cluster of social, cultural, and political dimensions of the urban school organization inhibit an equitable flow of resources to inner city schools and limit and lower the quality of urban education and educational policymaking. Thirteen federal policy suggestions are provided, and recommendations for overcoming financial constraints include avoiding noncategorical aid, reuniting State and urban educational governance, reforming the nation's educational information system, and improving the education profession's contribution.

        "description":"The results of a critical survey of research on educational effectiveness, performed to assess the current state of knowledge regarding the determinants of educational outcomes, are reported. An input-output approach was used to analyze the relationship between the amounts of various resources provided to students and the educational outcomes. Other approaches used were the process approach, the organizational approach, the evaluation approach, and the experimental approach. It was found that school resources are not consistently important, and that the role of peer-group influences is complex. Major implications of the research include the following: (1) Research has not identified a variant of the existing system that is consistently related to students' educational outcomes;  (2) Increasing expenditures on traditional educational practices is not likely to improve educational outcomes substantially; and (3) There seem to be opportunities for significant reduction of redirection of educational expenditures without deterioration in educational outcomes.

Sidney Tickton summarizes the CIT report of 1969-70 and new data highlights from the present study. He recommends that government agency sponsors of technology projects demand cost and result information and comparative studies with other systems presenting identical offerings. Sherwood Kohn sets forth the study objectives: (1) probe further into educational technology cost, and (2) attempt to assess potential benefits and costs of educational technology innovations. Mr. Kohn relates that the costs of educational TV, computer teaching techniques, and audiovisual aids were reviewed; the results of technological innovation in &quot;controlled&quot; environments and in disadvantaged and experimental schools  examined; and the effect of new educational tools and techniques on productivity determined. Data were gathered from consultations with over 50 authorities; polls of 90 educational TV stations and 50 State education departments; searches at ERIC centers for new reports on instructional technology; and from analysis of reports published by local school units. Data revealed that TV and computers, because of their cost effectiveness promise, are being accepted as teaching tools in crucial areas, and that there exists a deeper understanding and a greater use of technology by educators with a corresponding change in emphasis from teaching to learning and from mass to individual instruction.

The first paper is based on the assumption that provision of financial relief to parents who send their children to nonpublic schools would improve horizontal equity and be good public policy. The tax credit, as a method that appears to have promise, is discussed as to the history of tax credits, their justification for educational expenses, the design of the tax credit, its economic impact, administrative problems, constitutional problems, and treasury objectives. Two appendixes to the report present: State Experience with Tax Credits, and  Estimated Costs of Tax Credit Proposals. The second paper discusses the ways in which nonpublic school education can be aided by the national government. These ways are delineated under the following sections: Tax Benefits: Exclusions, Exemptions, Deducations, Credits; What Are Deductions For?; Do Tuitions Qualify under Our System of Tax Deductions?; Objections to Tuition Tax Credits; and A Tax Credit Plan.

This inadequacy is traced to two causes: (1) Data are not organized in ways that would facilitate policy formation and (2) Data are scattered among a variety of agencies. Formulating effective public policy for the support of elementary and secondary education requires a knowledge of (1) the demand for various kinds of educational services, (2) estimates of the costs of those demands, (3) a conception of equity in the distribution of educational services and of the costs of those services, and (4) a continuous monitoring and evaluation of the financial and educational impact of federal programs in particular, and of American education more generally. To develop recommendations for improving the  availability of information to those interested in questions of educational finance policy, the availability and usefulness of information on the important information on the nation's educational agenda were examined and catalogued through interviews, questionnaires, and staff analysis. The results of this research indicate that the present system of educational information fails to serve the requirements of those who need timely, reliable, and relevant information about the nation's educational problems.

        "description":"Two simultaneous conferences on Adult Education and Adult Basic Education were held because it was considered that interaction between the two conference groups would be mutually beneficial. The defined goal of this joint institute was: the identification of problems, strategies, and priorities as they relate to an on-going plan for staff development at all levels in each state engaged in Adult and Adult Basic Education. There were four distinct phases to the process of interaction at the institute. These were: (1) meetings of the university professors and graduate students, (2) a regional overview and state meetings, (3) two institute-wide work sessions, and (4) a regional planning exercise in state plan development. The most relevant outcomes of the institute were: (1) an  identification and ranking of common needs in the participating states in the area of staff development, (2) the commitment of the various participating groups to interact with others involved in Adult and Adult Basic Education programs to meet these needs, and (3) state plans for staff development, based on the needs, priorities, and strategies revealed in the work-group sessions. The group generally evaluated the conference as helpful to a moderate degree. (Author/CK)",

        "description":"A study was made of eight former Area Winning Community Clubs in Middle Tennessee. Sixteen club representatives and five County Agents were interviewed for the purpose of identifying and describing certain factors that contribute to the organization and continuation of community clubs. The study revealed that every primary reason for original organization and/or continuation came from within the group that constituted the club. The most important single reason for the above, as viewed by club representatives and agents, was that the community as a whole was interested in a specific project and felt that through group action their goal could be more easily attained. The primary reason for continuation of organization over time was because of a desire for recreation and fellowship  which could be enjoyed by the group. The community improvement program was shown to be an important channel for Extension teaching. During all three time periods studied, the primary problem was to get members of the community interested in the organization. During the original organization year, the projects undertaken initially were usually simpler, less expensive, and required less time to complete than in later years. (Author/DB)",

He then suggests that as professional goals for Continuing Education are reviewed and priorities established, the need for new &quot;services&quot; will be thoroughly explored. Dr. Bartlett believes that this is the appropriate time for Higher Education to increase its &quot;services,&quot; and that Continuing Education should act as the institution's agent in making known what the services are and how they might be used. As an illustration of one type of service that the university might offer, Dr. Bartlett discusses a frame-of-reference educational service on major current happenings, which would utilize non-commercial television stations and university faculty  and community participants. From this, it is hoped, interested adults would be provided with an opportunity to review the many aspects of a public issue. At the conclusion of his address, Dr. Bartlett expresses the hope that more of his colleagues will become more familiar with what has made Higher Education so successful, including University College and Adult Education at Syracuse University. He also urges everyone in Higher Education to recapture the art of saying &quot;thank-you&quot; to those who help the colleges and universities. Dr. Bartlett reiterates the need for an expanded array of community and social services, changed annually, and centrally administered by Continuing Education. (DB)",

        "description":"Three issues related to New Careers have been explored among a group of college students who are in the main children of lower white collar and blue collar parents, including some with poverty or ghetto backgrounds. The New Careers program has two major components: helping the poor through meaningful employment and opportunity for career ladder advancement in the human services, and helping professionals in social agencies through making available a supply of subprofessional indigenous workers, capable of bridging the gap between staff and clients by cross-interpreting agency and community. The three issues are: (1) Are the poor or those with restricted occupational choices responding to New Careers opportunities? (2) What is the effect of high mobility aspirations on New  Careers' interest; is the career-ladder idea sufficient to hold those from lower-class backgrounds? and (3) Is the bridging function congenial to New Careerists, and how does it jibe with the idea of job advancement? Tentative and partial findings show: (1) New Careerists are predominantly Black and female, from the lowest socioeconomic levels; (2) Their mobility aspirations are relatively high; and (3) The conditions for achieving success in the bridging role are less than favorable. Notes, references, and a brief appendix describing the family socialization for competence scale are provided. (DB)",

The first area discussed is the necessity for the tutor to get to know the students, and ways in which this can be accomplished are suggested. The students' motives for attending the class and for learning are to be viewed from the standpoint of the purpose of the class, which is defined as student-learning. The importance of the first meeting of a class is pointed out, and good first meetings are said to be those that arouse students' interest and immediately involve them in the learning process, as well as give them the opportunity of easily recognizable achievement. An example is given of a way in which a tutor in local history can devise an activity that involves  student participation. The tutor is advised that he must be constantly aware that his task is to help people both to understand things and to pass judgement on them. It is stated that often the tutor must not act as a lecturer, but rather as an animateur, enabler, and initiator. The syllabus should be constructed in view of what the real needs of the class are. Written work of the students is seen as an aid to learning. Other aids are reading books and maintaining scrapbooks. Tutor managed aids are visual aids, such as slides, films, and audiovisual aids.

The concept and methodology of functional education for family life planning was first considered, followed by a discussion of the preparation of written and audio-visual materials, and new ideas in using visual aids to promote literacy. Additionally, teacher training, program evaluation, and the role of international organizations in adult literacy programs for family life planning were  discussed. Finally, country teams reviewed or formulated programs, with a view toward clarifying plans and objectives. This report also discusses the &quot;why&quot; and the &quot;how&quot; of combining adult literacy education with family life planning.

Project planning included recruitment of staff and the selection of demonstration barrios, selection of the population literacy educators and organizing a local Literacy Family Planning Council in each pilot barrio and training teachers for the project. The function of the Council includes mobilizing and organizing the literacy/family planning classes and formulating policies for program implementation. Prior to start of classes, the teachers were familiarized with the new techniques being used in the project. The project will be subjected to continuous evaluation and analysis during its planned four-year period of operation. (CK)",

In contrast, cooperative effort throughout the state is the focus of the article on developing plans for Adult Basic Education (ABE) in Alabama. In Florida, the unique relationship between a local school system staff development person who works along with a university faculty member is described as a mode for determining and then meeting training needs. Section II describes what has evolved through coordinated planning and  training efforts in three states. The development of adult basic education capabilities of distinctive types at three institutions of higher education in Mississippi points out how responsibility can be delegated to serve both subject area and geographical needs. The growth and refinement of a delivery system for local ABE inservice training in South Carolina underlines how trained teachers can be part of a statewide network for local inservice training. The last presentation is an article on a supervisor's workshop describing orientation and training of ABE supervisory personnel in Tennesee. (Author/CK)",

The seminar was opened with a general session, in which introductory remarks were presented. Following these remarks, the first assignment was presented to the participants, who separated into professional  groups. After the group discussion sessions, feedback sessions were held to examine some of the common expectations of all participants. Inputs from the group discussions served as springboards for the state planning meetings. The states conducted their planning exercise, keeping in mind the following question: Taking the current state of staff development in your state, what specific next step shall be formulated or enacted for professional staff development in the coming year? At the closing session, changes that would be effected in adult education were discussed and evaluatory remarks made. (Author/CK)",

        "description":"This document is a summation of a workshop designed to be a planning experience for ABE training personnel. It also contains a sampling of model training designs developed by the participants for inservice work. The object of the seminar was to provide an overview of relevant techniques and procedures for developing and implementing short-term workshops and two-week institutes. During the three days of the seminar, participants would be actively involved in all phases of a workshop, and extract generalizations which could be used in their own situations. As a means of demonstrating climate setting, each of the six participants was asked to prepare a profile describing their individual members. At the conclusion of this exercise, the seminar director asked the seminar participants  to describe the type of climate established. After the design for training was outlined, each of the six working groups was asked to identify problem areas which they wished to consider further. Twelve problem areas were defined by the group. These include: (1) Institutional constraints against planning in advance, (2) How to bring the student to a recognition of his needs without losing him in the process, and (3) How to establish competencies of adult teachers. After the diagnosis of problems, each group was asked to design a model institute. The following format was used by all groups: a description of the general situation where the workshop would take place, including sponsor and financial arrangements. (Author/CK)",

Four different populations--deans, professors of education, graduate students in education, and educational researchers other than faculties of education--were studied, using a particular instrument designed for the purpose. All instruments were produced in English and French, and the first of three questionnaires were tested in both languages. Volume I contains two chapters: Chapter I deals with data obtained from the deans; Chapter II concerns data obtained from members of faculties of education. Volume II contains three chapters: Chapter III analyzes responses from students in the field of education, and Chapter IV deals with data from  researchers in organizations other than the faculties of education; Chapter V compares and contrasts the information obtained from all categories of respondents, and attempts to draw conclusions. Volume I contains 16 appendices and 104 tables, and Volume II contains 31 appendices and 112 tables. In addition, there are 48 recommendations, which concern background, activities, interaction, factors related to the undertaking of research, kinds of research being undertaken, meeting needs and offering incentives, training of researchers, and job opportunities.

The experimental design was ad hoc. The Research Officer drew up an interview schedule which would elicit information on some of the major attitudinal areas. A test was also used. In addition, a short personal questionnaire was drawn up for administration with the Attitude Scale to large numbers of students in further education colleges. Four colleges in Central Scotland were involved in this project. Information was obtained from a maximum of 2140 students. Among the basic items of information obtained were the ways in which students progress or fail to progress from year to year of their  college attendance and the explanations which students give for discontinuing their college attendance. Each grouping into which students can be divided produces a slightly different profile of attitudes and influences. This indicated that there is no overall prescription which would cure the problems set out in this investigation, but that the attitudes of each grouping into which students can be divided must be considered separately. By revealing some of the incentives and disincentives perceived by craft students in further education and objectives of these students, this investigation may provide the further education service with information required for consideration of changes in colleges and courses along the lines indicated by these craft students.

The outline was 1. Basic Organization of the Literacy Drive, 2. The Field Organization, 3. Teachers, 4. Materials, 5.

From a review of the various campaigns, some considerations that should be applied early in the planning of literacy campaigns are recommended: (1) a sufficient supply of primers and other materials be available; (2) an adequate number of capable supervisors must be available; (3) good and full time transportation must be provided; (4) class committees can ensure better student attendance; and (5) classes should continue for a second year.

With regard to knowledge of self, it is suggested that clients be given an adequate opportunity to think through their aspirations and anticipations of satisfaction in addition to considering their aptitudes and interests. Finally, the relationship between intelligence and achievement needs to be re-examined since attributes  other than intelligence are associated with achievement.

Correlations between external cues and social content were quite low in all conditions.

Much of the research on such factors as genetic and environmental influences, verbal ability, motivation, school achievement, attrition rate, demographic characteristics, health care and nutrition, has been biased; and efforts at intervention have been unsuccessful, with demonstration projects taking precedence over controlled experiments. Necessary to raise the standard of research and educational programs are: (1) increased funds for meaningful large-scale innovation; and (2) development of effective ideas for the best utilization of available funds. Suggestions for improvement include the better  understanding, and more appropriate design and control of social-psychological learning conditions; greater qualitative analysis of learning behaviors; matching this broader range of characteristics to the design of appropriate learning environments and experiences; and the need to change political factors in education. It is especially important to hold educators more directly accountable to those they serve, and to give greater attention to the role of students in the direction of their own education. (KS)",

Statistics of selected groups of handicapped people indicate a history of unemployment, underemployment, lack of job satisfaction and frustration. Even when professional training is introduced handicapped people generally receive lower wages than their non-handicapped peers. If this history is to be reversed then new approaches must be attempted in the rehabilitation process. The systems model represents one viable approach. With an understanding of the history of unemployment and underemployment of deaf people, the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID) has developed its programs and services utilizing the systems model. The major components of the NTID educational system are defined and described,  including the concept of accountability. The importance of feedback and program flexibility are highlighted. Three basic principles are inherent in the system: (1) the program must be a vital, dynamic, organized whole; (2) it should be behaviorally oriented and quantifiable, if possible; and (3) beginning and on-going documentation is mandatory.

A zero-order gamma of .28 indicates that educational expectations and athletic participation are positively associated. The possibility that this association is spurious is tested by statistically controlling 3 potentially confounding variables: social status, academic performance, and parental educational encouragement. A 3rd-order net partial association of .22 suggests that the association is not spurious, that the positive relationship between educational expectations and athletic participation is a result of the socialization experience of  interscholastic athletics rather than of differential selection into high school sports. Further analyses indicate, however, that the positive association is not constant over the relevant control variables but that it is an interactive relationship; specifically, that the positive association is strongest for those categories of respondents \"least\" positive disposed toward a college education and weakest for those categories of respondents \"most\" positively disposed toward a college education.

Efforts have been hindered by the brevity of sentences in a county jail, the fact that many inmates are merely passing through or unsentenced, and certain logistic problems such as state laws and certain practical limitations, which act as deterrents to meaningful involvement in the rehabilitation program. Services provided include diagnostic interviews and staff conferences; a community-based vocational rehabilitation program with counseling; an extensive adult education program which includes college courses,  physical education, alcohol education, and training in arts and crafts; job placement and follow-up; an efficiently-run library; psychotherapy and community mental health consultation; a successful volunteer program; and rehabilitation programs for drug and alcohol addicts.

To develop a technology for the implementation of appropriate social action, therefore, one must have a thorough understanding of the nature of such social indicators. In order to achieve this understanding, a survey was conducted to assess attitudes and values regarding violence. Level of violence found justifiable was expressed in terms of 2 indexes: violence for social control and violence for social change. In general, American men were found to be prepared to justify substantial amounts of violence by police, and yet were fairly open to social change. Their answers were analyzed according to 7 major categories of  variables: early and later background, values, identifications, definitions, beliefs about social issues, and perception of others. None of these variables, individually, proved a strong predictor of either violence for social change or for social control, but combined, they proved to have significant explanatory power. The results are discussed in detail and recommendations made for utilization of the findings in effecting social change. (KS)",

Three general classes of informational data were collected from both younger and older veterans: (1) perception of hospital services; (2) patient problems and services needed; and (3) demographic characteristics. It was found that real situational factors, for example recreational opportunities, quality of food and treatment, were responded to comparably by patients of all ages. GM&S patients and psychiatric patients, however, held significantly different views on situational, present need and special problem factors. Reality or situational factors contributed more to stated degree of satisfaction  than did age, though certain characteristics, such as drug usage, trouble with the law, and future-orientation, did differentiate older and younger groups. It is suggested, however, that alternative life-style paradigms be developed to cope with the greater problem of social marginality seen particularly in the differences between GM&S and psychiatric patients.

Modern concepts of early childhood learning and intellectual and emotional development are considered; hence child-centered and group-centered approaches are used, and the relationship with the teacher stressed. Mental health and ethnic considerations are emphasized throughout. To involve  the total personality, creative activities, discussion of information and attitudes, cooperative group games and role playing are encouraged as integral parts of the learning experience.

Hoffman reviews the various approaches to drug education, most of which are based upon the idea that giving people information will act as a deterrent to their use of drugs. A scale was administered to a large and varied population of students to assess affective (attitudinal), cognitive (knowledge) and behavioral factors regarding drugs. Results indicated that the more knowledge people possessed about drugs, the more liberal (pro-drug use)their attitudes were; drug users were more knowledgeable than non-users; and a low affective score (liberal attitude) also proved significantly related to drug usage. Swisher's review of drug education programs indicates a large variation in  program outcomes. Short-term programs have little impact on attitudes regarding drug abuse. Use of group counseling with information giving also makes no difference. In certain instances, giving of information was related to increased drug abuse, increased interest in acquiring additional knowledge about drugs, and liberalization of attitudes, but in general there is little evidence of beneficial effects.

Weekly inservice seminars were also conducted with the counseling staff to systematically train members in the use of parent counseling as a therapeutic tool. The students' levels and grades were weighted to allow comparison throughout elementary, junior high and high school. There was an overall improvement in grade point average, particularly at the junior high level. Most parents indicated that they were praising their children more and doing more things with and for them,  and felt the children worked harder and were more independent. Current ego psychology is used to explain the results. The increase in trustworthiness, reassurance and reward, in the environment, allows the child's ego to function on a more effective level and hence he will grow and develop in the role that is expected of him, namely his schoolwork. Illustrative cases are cited, and the practice of parent counseling is encouraged. (KS)",

The data indicated that the children's free play was significantly differentially affected by the combination of verbal instructions and reinforcement even when free play occurred 21 hours later.

The 1970 results were compared with 1966 results of the H.S.C.I. at the same high school when a different student body (black-white ratio) existed. Comparison of results indicated that there was a dramatic change in students' perceptions between 1966 and 1970 in both expected as well as unexpected directions, and teachers were able to predict with fair accuracy the students' perception of their environment. Some of the major conclusions of this study were that apathy is inversely related to violence and frustration level and violence increase  when black-white ratio is increased to a point where blacks are still a minority but have been exposed to middle-class values and advantages.

This paper has given a brief review of the concepts and some basic techniques. Clinical examples have been used to show the relationship and application to school difficulties. Systems Theory concepts and techniques are of use, therefore, not only for freeing up individual family members for better achievement, but also for correcting similar problem patterns between student and teacher, family and school, or school staff. The concepts beg for application within schools, but this seems not to have been widely attempted. Many reasons are suggested by skeptics within the educational systems; however, this is  often part of the educational system's pattern and an attempt to maintain the status quo. Use of the concepts and techniques would allow for understanding and clearing of the educational system pathology. (Author)",

What particular coping styles are preferred in different cultures? What differences are there between working class and upper-middle class in their dominant coping styles? Such choices of strategies in dealing with tasks are related to school achievement, vocational aspirations, and kinds of satisfactions young people seek in their work. By combining such measures of motivation and behavior style with measures of aptitude, better understanding and better prediction of individual achievement is sought. The study also seeks information about how children are influenced by family experiences in the development of their coping styles. This paper offers preliminary  findings from a cross-national study of school children from 8 countries. This work is the basis for an experiment now under way in the Research and Development Center for Teacher Education to test ways of training teachers to improve the coping effectiveness of their pupils.

Finally, the author supports the understanding of: (1) ability and achievement measures as relatively unchanging; (2) situational factors that modulate individual behavior in its totality, i.e., evidence on performance of individuals from minority groups; (3) the few longitudinal studies about a few crucial personality traits; and (4) the relative effectiveness of intervention procedures.

Families were assigned to the High Classroom Adjustment (HCA) group and Low Classroom Adjustment (LCA) group on the basis of teacher evaluations of self-sufficiency, self-control, achievement motivation, and behavior observations in the school. Interaction sessions were scheduled for each family, with comparisons made between the 2 groups revealing that HCA families  displayed more positive and less negative interaction than LCA families. Comparisons between individual family members in the 2 groups were completed also. Results indicate that basic differences do exist between these 2 family groups in their interaction patterns.

Several conclusions are drawn from the results: (1) response perseverance in sequential learning tasks may be due to the proactive effects of the informative feedback, not necessarily to the consequences of the event; (2) a PREE in sequential learning tasks results from  the proactive effects when discriminative cues for forthcoming, positive feedback are established; and (3) extinction in these more complex learning tasks may not be related to loss of habit strength, but rather to the mere abandonment of one strategy in search of another.

Regardless of the method used, problems abound, e.g., most certification requirements guarantee exposure to courses--not competence. Additional problems are noted in the areas of grandfather clauses, the teaching requirement, reciprocity between states,  enforcement policies, non-differentiated certificates, accountability of training institutions, provisional certificates, norm writing, and many more.

These disappointing results can be explained by the Contingency Model. This theory postulates that task motivated low esteem for the Least Preferred Coworker (LPC) leaders perform best in very favorable and unfavorable situations while relationship--motivated (high LPC) leaders perform best in situations of intermediate favorableness. It has been assumed that training in the job's technical aspects and in handling interpersonal relations will make a leader more effective. In contrast, the Contingency Model holds that we must see training as improving the favorableness of the leadership situation. Therefore, in very favorable and unfavorable situations, training and  experience will improve the performance of low LPC leaders but decrease performance of high LPC leaders. In intermediate situations training should increase the performance of high LPC leaders but decrease that of low LPC leaders. This hypothesis is supported by data from previous studies as well as 2 recent studies which specifically tested this hypothesis. (Author)",

        "description":"Answers from questionnaires administered to middle-class freshman and junior students in 4 different rural and suburban high schools were used to assess predisposition to violence. The findings indicated a modest inverse relation between violence proclivity and age, with a sharp difference between boys and girls, reflecting our cultural norms. Though violence-proneness showed no variation by social class, it proved strongly inversely related to school success. There was a clear indication of an association between conservative Christian orthodoxy and violence-proneness; however, people with no formal religious identification also proved violence-prone. One's perception of peer group norms also shows a strong relation to violence proclivity. The presence of a  gratification-deferral syndrome, which includes aggression deferral, reduces violent proclivities. The strong relation to sex and school success, as well as to reference group norms and middle-class value commitments like gratification deferral, is strongly reminiscent of what the literature shows to be the chief determinants of juvenile delinquency. The assertion that Americans are a violent people is discussed. (KS)",

The 3rd paper presents the results of a self report study of 10th  grade boys in a framework of person-environment interactions.

        "description":"Historically, the ethnic minorities in American life have utilized 3 major routes of upward social mobility. These are unskilled labor, ethnic crime and ethnic politics. These modes of mobility are viewed as adjustment mechanisms to the forced and sometimes violent exclusions of the respective ethnic minority from the conventional American mainstream. The dominant elites viewed these ethnic newcomers with scorn and suspicion and the overall stance of the elites was one of \"militant defensiveness\" wherein every attempt was made to guard their cherished Anglo-American social and political institutions. Consequently the routes of labor, crime and politics created situations whereby each group \"made it\" into the dominant society on its terms rather than on the terms of the dominant  elites. This analysis seeks to explore these observations in relation to contemporary ethnic minorities, particularly blacks and Puerto Ricans. The impact of racial factors is minimized and considered secondary to the dominant impact of class factors. The plight of contemporary ethnic minorities is thus seen in ethnic and class terms, rather than in racial terms. (Author)",

        "description":"Recent theoretical analyses have implied that there may be age differences in children's tendency to exercise component selection, i.e., to attend selectively to a single component of stimulus objects in a learning situation. In the present study, 6 experiments were conducted, each designed to investigate developmental changes in component selection across ages 4, 8, and 12. In the first of 2 principal experiments, children's tendency to exercise component selection was found to decrease from ages 4 to 8, and this result contrasted with a lack of change over this age range in children's incidental learning. These results suggest that, by age 8, children tend to utilize redundant stimulus information when it is a useful aid for learning as in a component selection task, but are  also able to ignore such information when it is nonfunctional or \"incidental.\" The second of the 2 major experiments examined component selection at varying levels of training. As the children learned the task, they were found to maintain attention to secondary stimulus information as well as to the more salient component of the stimuli; thus, the children's attention did not appear to become more selective as learning proceeded to criterion. Also, overtraining did not generally tend to \"broaden\" attention as expected. (Author/TA)",

The monograph demonstrates that a body of useful knowledge and theory does exist for the level of individual development and adaptation. From the field of psychoanalytic theory, ego psychology and social psychology are drawn sets of interrelated propositions. These propositions systematically interrelate micro with macro concepts of development and change by means of a model developed expressly for that purpose. The approach outlines crucial variables in the nature of self-organization,  conceptualizing the relationship between self and environment in a framework different from that usually adopted in the literature. At a minimum, then, the monograph extensively explores the micro level of change as it is known in ego psychology and proposes alterations in micro level concepts. (Author/TA)",

The technique utilized is Multiple Discriminant Analysis (MDA). MDA eliminates the shortcomings of regression-correlation and uses only quantifiable information. The 2 variables that proved significant in the 3 tests were (1) the Social Consciousness Score test (administered by the Educational Testing Service) and (2) the percentage of college costs financed by grants. It was shown that successful students have a greater concern for social issues which is reflected in their greater persistance in college; also that successful students have a higher percentage of grants than unsuccessful students. High School Rank proved  significant, while High School Average did not. Conclusions include that (1) MDA has application (69-8790 successful in study) for the college population as a whole; (2) loans are not necessarily the most effective way to finance higher education; and (3) the entire area of useful indicators of college student success should be reevaluated.

The first paper concentrates on the methodology of applied research, using an experimental as opposed to an observational strategy. That is, the experimenter intervenes with special \"treatments\" in a real-life social institution, much as he would in a laboratory experiment, and the behaviors studied are typically of real social concern. The 2nd paper considers a number of specific questions raised by the attempt to apply reinforcement principles in educational and therapeutic settings and suggests some lines of further research. Several concerns are: (1) the question of whether and how behavior can be maintained after special programs of reinforcement are terminated; (2) extensive,  systematic study of the relationship between \"programmed\" and \"natural\" rewards is badly needed before reinforcement principles can be widely and well used in applied settings; and (3) developing effective training and maintenance programs for reinforcement agents.

As a process, they represent one phase in the delineation of a training program. As a product, they are drawn form observations of team leaders in action in 10 cities, a survey of all Teacher Corps leaders and directors, and the collected position papers of persons expert at one or another of the necessary competencies. These guides can be used by directors of individual Teacher Corps projects, along with other study products, as resources in their training programs. The format centers around (1) competencies needed by a team leader, (2) objectives for a training program to create identified competencies, (3) interim objectives related to the general competency  objectives, (4) specific behaviors, (5) materials that could be utilized, and (6) recommendations concerning the time limits for the mastering of each interim objective.

Responses indicated that federally funded education programs have often caused major changes in educational governing structures with consequent disruptions of planning activities. The authors conclude that planning performance in State education agencies could be improved by improving relations and communications with the Federal Government and by pursuing planning at the highest organizational levels in the agencies.

This analysis attempts to demonstrate that since additional revenues are needed for local governments and an inequitable and destructive revenue system is urgently in need of reform, the optimum solution to the property tax dilemma may be the municipal income tax. Following an introductory discussion of the concept of taxation equity in terms of the &quot;benefit received&quot; and &quot;ability to pay&quot; principles, the discussion explores the relevance of these principles to the financing of public education. A summary description of the municipal income tax  recounts its history, describes its characteristics, and discusses its probable future. A list of findings and recommendations resulting from analysis of existing local income taxes, review of relevant literature, and consideration of the community needs and characteristics is provided.

It sets up a hypothetically ideal pattern for the investment portfolio of typical State pension fund on the basis of security and return criteria. From this model the implication is made that benefits of teacher pension funds might be increased (or contributions reduced) by as much as one third if the model were applied to the average fund. The study presents a compilation of information on the history of teacher pensions and improvements of and comparisons among State systems, and offers recommendations to those responsible for teacher pension  funds.

One means through which education can become more relevant and responsive to the demands of society and the local community is that of the Educational Cooperative. The Cooperative is a voluntary confederation among school districts, universities or colleges, and the State departments of education to increase local ability to improve education cooperatively. The Cooperative is designed to mobilize the capabilities of the education profession in resolving complex educational problems. Utilizing a problem solving approach, the process emphasizes identification of  needs, careful planning of solutions, and rigorous evaluation of results; and provides a new organization unhampered by tradition and institutionalized patterns of behavior. This document outlines the need for such an organization, its administrative system, and the factors and decisions affecting the installation of the Cooperative. (Author)",

Because in both Canada and in the United States the constitution assigns responsibility for education to the provincial and State governments, the author believes that accountability should begin at these levels.

Factual data were gathered in a series of interviews with central office personnel, and with the principals and counselors of numerous secondary schools. Related literature, including unpublished documents and working papers of the cooperating school systems, was reviewed; and a survey instrument was designed, tested, and implemented. Responses were received from the students and professional  staffs of 31 high schools from four Metropolitan Atlanta school systems.

This study represents activities conducted as the Phase I portion of the 4-phase voucher plan (February 15-May 15, 1971). The first section focuses on activities in the State of Washington relevant to the inception of the Seattle feasibility study. The bulk of the report covers a series of preplanning tasks or problem areas that will need to be resolved prior to any decision regarding the actual establishment of the demonstration project. In each of the areas studied, several alternatives are presented as an aid to the Seattle Board of Education as it deliberates the merits of the voucher plan. Related documents are ED 049 522 and EA 003 961.  (Author)",

        "description":"Special education, it is stated, must reform its modus operandi on many fronts to reach the goal of equal educational opportunity for all children. It is shown that our educational systems violate the dignity and personal integrity of many children, and that we must stop making economic advantage the primary criterion for judging the adequacy of educational efforts for all children. Several criticisms of special education point out where it has erred, such as in following a medical model too closely. Enumerated are eight factors which are fueling the slow movement away from the traditional categorical disease model approach. In assessing how special education is doing we are seen to be using inadequate criteria. To combat discouragement, the real achievements which have been made  for handicapped children since 1930 are reviewed. Suggestions of priority are advanced for improving service. The nine recommendations concern state role, cross categorical orientation, use of federal funds, program evaluation, and other program features. It is concluded that, if action is not taken, instructional practices of demonstrated inefficiency will be perpetuated and resources will be wasted. (KW)",

Guidelines for the planning and design of preschool day care facilities, especially for mentally retarded and other children with developmental disabilities, are established. The current status and trends in day care services are summarized and the background, learning characteristics, and curriculum objectives for retarded, culturally deprived, and normal children are described. Methods and activities used to achieve these objectives, and the implications they have for the supporting physical environment, are identified. Component parts of the physical environment (color, light, acoustics, climate control, interior surfaces, space, flexibility) are  discussed individually and in their relationship with each other and various psychological variables. Suggested detailed planning and design requirements for the preschool facility cover the education/training area, ancillary area, administrative area, storage, furniture, and safety. The planning and design process necessary for utilization of these guidelines is illustrated by four hypothetical case studies in which facilities are designed for different day care situations.

It was found that the majority of administrators were married men between the ages of 35 and 49 years. Administrative experience and preparation usually consisted of 10 to 19 years of professional experience as teacher, supervisor, or administrator, with an average of 1 to 3 years as a special education administrator; more than half the administrators had studied 1 year beyond the Master's degree. Conditions of employment were found to usually include a 12 month contract, a 45-hour work week, and an annual  salary average of $14,687. As administrators, many viewed themselves as leaders who performed important roles in policy development for the educational system and as supervisors, many viewed their roles as that of modifying and adapting curriculum of special education programs. Also examined were the organizational characteristics of the special education program, resources available for administration, community relations, and selective administrative opinions. (CB)",

The second paper, by D. C.

Although the ideas are developed from simple to complex, there is no attempt to correlate mathematical ideas with grade levels. The general stated philosophy is that the retarded child learns best by experiencing and finds satisfaction and reinforcement in successful endeavors. Guidelines for the instruction of fundamental operations in mathematics cover addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division. The use of a number line in addition and the teaching of multiplication after addition and before subtraction are advocated. The number line is also advocated in the teaching of subtraction and division. The section on the teaching of time includes many sample work sheets that may  be helpful in the sequential presentation of time-related concepts. The chapter on teaching of measurement emphasizes that the teaching of measurement will be augmented if many play activities requiring use of measurement techniques accompany the instruction. The last instructional section concerns money and emphasizes that children need to have many experiences handling real money under supervision. Suggested learning sequences, activities, and reinforcements accompany the sections on measurement, time, and money. (CB)",

Two two-word similarities tests were used to measure verbal abstraction in the pretest session. The first condition of stimulus enhancement consisted of two five-word similarities tasks, and the second stimulus enhancement condition consisted of two two-word similarities tasks. Four tests were used to measure verbal abstraction in the posttest period. Identical instructions were given for pretests and posttests. Research results indicated that apparent verbal abstracting deficit in cultural-familial retarded individuals resulted from a deficit of information  input. Verbal abstraction scores were raised by increasing the number of exemplars in a verbal abstraction task. It was found that concept training procedures designed to familiarize the subject with concept names and exemplary words aided future performance on tasks utilizing the same concepts with different exemplars. Results indicated that training did not aid performance on a task with different concepts.

Discussed are the referral procedure, the physical setting of the three Tennessee re-education centers, and the organization of a children's re-education center. Job descriptions and qualifications are noted for  teacher counselors, diagnostician, aides, supervisory personnel, and principal. The individual child's curriculum is then explained to be adapted to his specific needs with emphasis on group counseling.

        "description":"Reviewed on a layman's level was research on psychopharmacology with the emotionally and behaviorally disturbed. General conclusions drawn from the man y studies were that the effect of drugs on intellectual functioning had not been determined and that there was little evidence to indicate that the learning process was consistently and reliably affected in certain predictable ways. It was advised that the psychologist be informed when a subject was receiving drug medication, the drug name, and dosage. The review concerned stimulants, tranquilizers, and sedatives frequently used by pediatricians. Stimulants referred to in research included dextroamphetamine, D-amphetamine, methylphenidate, monoaminoxidase inhibitors, amitriptyline, proamitriptyline, and cholinergics;  methylphenidate was the drug used most often. Tranquilizers cited were thioridazine, chlorpromazine, reserpine, phenothiazines, diphenylmethanes, fluphenazine hydrochloride, chlorprothixene hydrochloride, primazine hydrochloride, and thiorpropazate; drugs were found to be an advisable treatment for behaviorally disordered children. Sedatives covered included diphenylhydantoin sodium and captodiamine hydrochloride. (CB)",

All E teachers were given inservice training in a specific teaching curriculum (Social Learning Curriculum) and method (inductive method), and provided with on-going assistance from program consultants. Tape recordings and observational rating scales were used to assess teacher use of the method and curriculum. Students' progress in intelligence, achievement, personality development, and cognitive style was evaluated by formal tests. It was found that E teachers used the social learning curriculum and inductive method more consistently and effectively than did C teachers; E  students were superior in personality development (striving for success) and aspects of divergent thinking; there was little correlation between teacher background characteristics and use of the curriculum and method. It was concluded that application of a socially oriented curriculum using an inductive teaching style achieves results consistent with needs of retardates at maturity (personality and cognitive characteristics consonant with critical thinking and independent behavior).

In addition, a sorting task preceded the list for half of the Ss. Ss were tested for recall after each of three trials. Responses were analyzed by two methods: one required responses of Ss organized into categories predetermined by the experimenter, and one used the organizational patterns of Ss. Contrary to predictions, the sorting task did not result in higher clustering or recall scores. However, organized list presentation resulted in significantly higher recall scores than did randomized presentation. Subjective organization scores could not be obtained due to the very low number of scoreable responses of this type. It was  suggested that subjective organization reflects a concept-formation process while associative clustering involves concept-usage. (Author/KW)",

Findings showed positive correlations between ability to read fingerspelled and computerspelled words (similar sequential tasks), and between ability to read words and identify letters. Deaf Ss were superior to hearing Ss in identifying words but  inferior in identifying letters. For highly experienced Ss performance on a word task was nearly independent of word length. More letters were identified when Ss wrote letters as they were sent rather than waiting unti l all letters were sent. Number of letters reported increased as length of letter group increased, but only if order was not considered. Performance for high imagery words was better than for low imagery words.

Main purpose of the first three studies was to investigate the controversy between developmental and defect theorists in mental retardation. Study 1 revealed no normal-retarded differences on conservation tasks of unequal difficulty and offered support for the developmental theorists. Studies 2 and 3 also revealed no normal-retarded differences on tasks of low complexity but differences did become apparent on more complex tasks. Normals were better able to eliminate irrelevant dimensions and respond to the relevant dimension in the learning tasks of Study 2 and showed more  efficient use of information for generating problem-solving strategies in Study 3. Interpretation of findings was difficult because appropriate equating for socio-economic backgrounds of subjects was possible only in Study 1. Study 4 showed that the personality variables Achievement Need and Locus of Control are significant determiners of probability learning performance. It was concluded that findings had value for any theory of intellectual and motivational systems, but did not resolve the developmental-defect controversy. (Author/KW)",

        "description":"In assessing the possibilities of using cable television to serve the needs of higher education, it is useful to examine the experience already accumulated by educational institutions in the use of cable channels. Two particularly interesting cases are those of Oregon State University (OSU) and the University of Oregon. OSU employs its cable channel nearly full-time during the day to televise course presentations (largely of scientific and engineering subjects) to students both on and off campus. Enrollments in these televised courses has grown to 8,500 students annually. The rationale for employing the cable channel is to save money and classroom space. The University of Oregon employs its channel, not to present course materials directly, but to supplement and enrich live  course presentations in the classroom by providing programming at the request of individual faculty members. In addition, the channel provides a daily message service, an information service as an integral part of the University's registration procedures, and local community programming. A possible explanation for the University of Oregon's lack of televised course presentations is that the school is largely a liberal arts school and neither the courses nor the faculty are amenable to the idea of new technology.

These techniques were put together in a comprehensive computerized model in order to estimate in detail the potential impact of cable on broadcasting. On the basis of these estimates, it i s predicted that cable will have the highest penetration in areas with two or fewer local signals; that large stations will likely gain and small stations lose audience as a result of cable growth; that strong positive relationships will exist between quantity and  quality of public service and local programming and station revenue; and that the overall revenue lost due to cable (estimated to be about 9 percent) is small enough so that it would be wiped out by one year's normal revenue growth.

Such equipment has been beneficial in revealing objectives that might otherwise be overlooked, developing a logical presentation without extraneous material, establishing definable objectives, and encouraging self-evaluation as an integral part of the learning process. During the development and validation stages, the equipment can be used for initial scripting, for editing and re-editing, for obtaining content approval, and for individual tryout by students. Finally, the techniques enable the  course writers to obtain a viewable end product before they have to commit themselves on the media to be used. The videotapes can then be used as the draft or shooting script for the development of the manual, motion picture, or prenarrated slide sequence. The major criterion is that the equipment be available so that systems designers can use it with a minimum of interruption of their creative endeavors. (Author/JK)",

        "description":"The traditional approach to teaching experimental psychology has emphasized laboratory instruction. But too often this means most time is spent on handling rats or wiring circuits. Students would better learn how psychologists think by designing their own, open-ended problems rather tahan duplicating classical experiments. Since this approach is certainly expensive and possibly not efficient, a partial solution is a computer-based simulation game, which lets a student make some of the kinds of decisions a psychologist would make in collecting data relevant to the problem under discussion. This system leaves out the task of data collection, which though valuable often takes up too much time in an introductory course and also should perhaps be taught separately. The particular task  in the DATACALL game is to determine which variables have effects on the outcome of a phenomenon and how big they are. Students play against the computer, and their results are posted so they can be discussed by other students. Advantages of this technique are: 1) rapid data acquisition allows many rounds of practice and more complex designs to be run than would be possible in the usual way, and 2) students are motivated to learn about statistical techniques because they see their relevance to their decision-making.

A computer automatically generated a simulated display. It then monitored and analyzed a student's work in the performance of assigned training tasks. Two major tasks were studied. The first, maintaining an aircraft in a holding pattern solely through instrument indicators, involved perceptual motor skills. A monitor system for this task was implemented and used with both new and experienced pilots. The second task area involved the acquisition of those perceptual skills essential to ship maneuvering and collision avoidance. A graduated sequence of course estimation problems presented on a screen permitted both the gradual acquisition of skills and isolation of conspicuous learning difficulties. On the basis of the latter studies, a framework was constructed for detecting those deeper underlying difficulties which show up in more complex and realistic maneuvering situations. Implications for the development of improved methods of behavior modification and their incorporation in training programs are discussed. (Author/JY)",

Subjects, who were 404 fourth through sixth grade girls, completed questionnaires on TV exposure, family attitudes toward violence, and social class.

The results for all four measures indicate that family attitudes toward aggression showed the most persistent  relationship to the child's aggressive attitudes. However, exposure to television violence also made a consistent, independent contribution to the child's notions about violence--the greater the level of exposure, the more the child was willing to use violence, to suggest it as a solution to conflict, and to perceive it as effective. There were no social class differences.

Results showed that there was relatively strong agreement on only three aspects of the child's television habits--the nonviolent shows he watched and his frequency of watching with either his parents or his friends. Also, there was more viewing of programs considered violent among children who did a significant amount of television watching with one or both of their parents present, and the child more often finds the use of violence justified when the parents watched a substantial frequency of violent programs.

About 1960 the educational community began to realize that instructional technology is different from audiovisual education, that the use of media should be an integral part of the instructional system, and that instructional technology will change the role of the teacher. Schools began to acquire hardware and software and to make efforts to retrain teachers in their use. Although most schools are still operating on the basis of the \"audiovisual aid\" definition of educational technology, a clear trend among a few \"leader schools\" toward a more  sophisticated application of technology can be discerned. Within the next ten to fifteen years major changes will have to be made in the training and retraining of teachers to give more emphasis on individualizing instruction, operating as a member of a team, assessing pupil achievement and diagnosing learning difficulties, providing a working knowledge of technology and selecting and/or producing instructional material and instructional systems. Several problems lie ahead in the re-education process, and steps must be taken to facilitate the role change of the teacher. (Author/JY)",

The next impact tends to be on the support systems and procedures associated with the man-machine relationships; and lastly the related goals and values of the total effort tend to change. The impact of technology on librarians and libraries has thus been first on devices and media, then on the role of the librarian, and lastly on the concept of a library. An example of the latter is the systematic attempt to apply information science in networking systems that are user oriented. The impact of information overload, changes in formats in which information is stored, changes in man-machine relationships, more emphasis on cost effectiveness, changes  in patterns of education organization, individualization of instruction, and changes in goals and roles of librarians can all be seen as the result of a developing technology which forces the re-examination of the goals and values of the library for the future (Author/JY)",

Experiences within Britain and North America have suggested that educational technology--film, television, sound tape, and satellite--can be an effective way for universities to share. Discussions at the University of Guyana and the University of the West Indies and correspondence and discussions with representatives of other Commonwealth universities have shown that exchanges of this kind would help meet the needs felt by the universities. Further discussions about the practical obstacles to  the exchange of teaching indicated that the technical difficulties will rapidly become easier to solve and that costs will go down. A five-year program of research and action with technology, education, comparative studies in the social sciences, and Afro-Asian studies should be undertaken to provide more information about the potential of links between universities.

It is unlikely, however, that this culture can or will dispense with technology. Instead, its characteristic will be a new form of humanism in which the rational and irrational sides of humanity will be fused into a harmonious whole. Such a fusion poses a challenge to scientists and their platform of rational objectivity. Engineers, by contrast, are mediators between science and humanity. They need to recognize the existence and value of the less rational components now coming into their own through the new culture. Engineers should turn towards humanism both in their professional and personal attitudes. Professionally, they should accept a role as a  responsible mediator, work through their organizations to make sure the organization works for the good of society, and obtain a broad rather than overspecialized education. Personally, they should take a broad interest in society, in the creation of art and literature, in history, and in life. (Author/JK)",

The solution to generalizing about ill-formedness of this type is by means of a derivational constraint which is formulated in such a way as to link certain features of remote structure to certain features of surface structure. The violation is not stated in terms of a restriction on transformations but rather as a static filter on the output of the syntactic component. This paper refines and formally states the requisite derivational constraint so that it is not too powerful. The author examines the consequences for  linguistic theor y of postulating such a derivational constraint. The argument for using such a constraint, details on its development, and references are presented. (Author/VM)",

The results, subjected to statistical analysis, illustrate error trends and tendencies toward syntactic confusion, i.e. the Japanese students are able to follow the transformational routine to some extent. If it is possible to map what one can do in English as a foreign language on the individualistic chronological scale of learning history, it might be possible  to use a developmental procedure in foreign language acquisition. A list of references is included. (Author/VM)",

This paper discusses some of the ambiguities arising from phonemic changes and provides examples of pronunciation variations in British and Australian English--mainly in vowels, but also in consonants and syllabification. Several American English forms are also mentioned. Since pronunciation ambiguities can cause problems for the student learning English as a second language, teachers must look at language sociologically and prescribe a norm for language instruction. There should be greater explicitness in the description of English as spoken by educated Australians, and similarities and differences with British English should be noted. (VM)",

The migrant child must be taught to learn how to learn, and learning experiences must be structured to promote education in school subjects and communication with peers. There is a problem of acculturation; migrant children must be taught to develop a differentiation mechanism to bridge two cultural systems and two language systems. There must be a systematic growth of cultural awareness, and the Australian community must also recognize and accept foreign cultures. The new concept of the pluralistic society should be adopted. Language-learning and teaching-research centers should be established to specialize in the study of problems in second language learning;  applied linguistics; evaluation and development of curriculum, tests, and teaching materials; and information coordination and dissemination.

Speech cues may belong to the class of human sign stimuli which, as in animal behavior, may be the product of an innate releasing mechanism. Prelinguistic speech for man may have functioned as a social-releaser system. Human language developed as a result of the intellect, which was capable of making a semantic representation of the world of experience and the phonetic social-releaser system. Linguistic capacity--the ability to learn the grammar of a language--was also necessary. Grammar evolved to interrelate the semantic product of the intellect and the phonetic product of the prelinguistic communication system. References are included. (Author/VM)",

The perceptual process may be divided into stages (auditory, phonetic, phonological, syntactic, and semantic), but it must also be supposed that there is feedback from higher to lower levels which may serve to correct or verify earlier decisions. Perceptual \"correction\" of an auditory or phonetic decision, in light of a higher linguistic decision, will presumably not occur if the lower decision is firm.

The anatomic basis of human speech production is the result of a long evolutionary process in which the Darwinian process of natural selection acted to retain mutations. For auditory perception, the listener operates in terms of the acoustic pattern of the entire syllable according to the \"motor theory of speech perception.\" According to the theory, human listeners perceive speech in terms of the constraints imposed by the speech-producing apparatus. It has recently been possible to reconstruct the supralaryngeal vocal tracts of extinct hominid species. Computer-implemented supralaryngeal vocal tract modelling indicates that these extinct species lacked the anatomic ability  necessary to produce the range of sounds necessary for human speech.

Changes were made, as necessary, in order to create additional symbols resembling the traditional grapheme as closely as possible. Pronunciation tests were administered following the initial period, and statistical results are discussed.

The expository framework (and the implicit framework of the research itself) is based upon that of Rosenbaum (1967). The aim of the paper is to arrive at a rough picture of the kinds of structures and syntactic devices evidenced by Hungarian complement (and other) constructions. The author seeks to justify the validity of the following notions in a grammar of Hungarian complementation: the existence, in the base component, of a particular phrase-structure rule concerning embedding in a complex sentence; and the presence of the syntactic transformations of extraposition, equi-noun-phrase deletion, and possible subject-raising. Before a  discussion of subject raising, the author demonstrates how the syntactic machinery he has described works in the derivation of a variety of surface constructions involving essentially the same underlying structure. A list of references is included. (Author/VM)",

In order to estimate and allocate the nation's supply of trained specialists, therefore, one must know not only the size of the college graduating class but also the percentages in various fields who go on to graduate school, the number who complete their degrees, and the length of time of degree work. This report attempts to provide some of this information as related to scientific fields concerned with medical and health-related manpower. The report is organized into four chapters that (1) analyze factors related to patterns of enrollment in graduate school; (2) analyze factors related to  the realization of plans for advanced study in the selected science fields; (3) examine the work experiences of those who did not realize their plans for advanced study; and (4) examine the relationship between graduate school experiences and career plans of science students.

RRPM has great potential as a planning tool that can improve resource management in higher education. Its cost computations represent an important first step in the difficult task of allocating costs back to degree winners, the ultimate outputs of the educational process. Used in a predictive mode, RRPM generates a large amount of information relevant to the planning of both support and capital budgets. Used in a simulation mode it provides a powerful tool for examining the consequences of alternative policy formulations.  Additionally, RRPM serves as a very suggestive starting point for the definition of a comprehensive data base on one hand and for the further investigation of phenomena that are not now included in the model itself on the other.

This personality difference could be due to student differences upon college entrance, or could be a result of the effects of the structural aspects of colleges and universities as social institutions. These 2 possibilities were explored by using the Social Maturity Scale of the Omnibus Personality Inventory, and results show that student change is related to the social structures of the colleges attended  as well as to student characteristics upon college entrance.

The various categories covered in the survey included freshman applications, freshman admissions, freshman head-count enrollment, total undergraduate head-count enrollment, total graduate head-count enrollment, total full-time equivalent undergraduate enrollment, and total full-time equivalent graduate enrollment. Findings generally show that enrollment has been decreasing in the last several years. Most of the participating institutions had predicted a rise in enrollment for 1970-71; however, a follow-up survey indicates that these  predictions were wrong and that yet another decrease actually occurred. This constant decrease in enrollment is not only affecting institutional size but also the financial situation of the colleges.

The opening session dealt with the present state of affairs in liberal arts education; the second was devoted to specific proposals for charting new courses involving a more creative usage of teachers of liberal arts; the third session was devoted to a discussion of some of the premises upon which the new liberal education can be based; the fourth session  focused on the function of the teaching of science and technology in the new liberal arts; the fifth session turned attention to the problem of the teaching of values in the liberal arts; the sixth session centered around the question of the function of liberal education for social responsibility; and the final session looked toward the future roles for liberal education.

The study deals with 10 representative member institutions of the Regional Council for International Education (RCIE). Data were gathered by means of a questionnaire and a 3-member research team that visited each campus for extensive interviews with students, faculty, and administrative personnel. Two conditions are found to be most important on campus for successful participation in interinstitutional cooperation for international development: (1) support from the top administrative leadership, and (2)  general receptivity among faculty. Three phases of RCIE operations are identified as the most important in assuring effectiveness: (1) adequate liaison between the campus and the central office; (2) greater involvement of campus personnel in the decisionmaking process; and (3) a broad-ranging communication and information dissemination program to assure that an adequate knowledge of the organization is available on campus.

The Act, a piece of model legislation in the area of collective negotiations, provides for the right of employees to organize and to be represented by an exclusive bargaining agent; provides for mediation, fact-finding, and arbitration services; and takes a position on the use of strikes by employees. A key provision of the Act is the defining of \"public employer\" to include the Commonwealth and its political subdivisions as well as any nonprofit organization or institution, and any institution that receives government appropriation or grants. Under this definition, both the public and private colleges and universities in Pennsylvania are covered. Thus far, there has been little activity  on the private campuses where a drive for representation is concerned. There has been a growing interest, however, in the state's institutions of higher education. The state colleges have a representative agent and actual bargaining has begun. Seven of the 14 community colleges have elected agents, and 3 of these already have agreements. Other public institutions in the state are involved in various stages of the entire process.

In the first phase the subjects learn a list of paired-associates to a certain performance level. In the second phase (interpolated learning) other sets of paired-associates are learned. Finally, phase three consists of recall of the list from the first learning phase. Here the experimenters were interested in how different kinds of interpolated learning affect recall. The first experiment varied the incentives offered during the interpolated phase. It was found that learning the interpolated list did interfere with recall of the first list (retroactive inhibition); however, the amount of interferences did not vary as a function of the  size of the incentive. The second experiment explored the effect of different incentives and different instructions about how to learn the work lists. Regardless of the type of instructions, more of the low-pay-off, interfered-with terms than high-pay-off, interfered-with terms from the original list were recalled. The third experiment increased the amount of interpolated learning to be done. In this case, a pay-off for learning interfering, interpolated items produced less interference for males than females.

The papers, in the main, emphasize student assessment of their colleges and universities and the assessment by society as a whole of its postsecondary educational institutions. Some of the papers review important historical concepts that make the present air of crisis more understandable. Some of them present evidence of past and present needs of ethnic minorities that can be of genuine help as we grope to find the way from conscious or unconscious racism toward a  truly open society.

The papers present information concerning programs and developments in some of the nation's newer colleges that have grown up as a result of the demand for fewer traditional programs in higher education and more innovation and experimentation. The papers, as a whole, seem to show that it is time for in-depth evaluation and reorganization of these new colleges, for goals seem not to have been clearly defined at the outset of their creation. Many of the colleges have had to retreat to traditional curricula to maintain their existence. Others are struggling along, facing the eminent danger of closing doors with the end of  each new semester. It is hoped that the efforts recorded here will encourage those colleges represented in this volume and others in similar situations to reflect deeply on their obligation to engage in evaluation, not only for the benefit of their own programs, but to provide concrete evidence upon which others may reach conclusions as to the desirability of commitment of more resources into these or other innovations.

It is the position of the American Association of Law Schools (AALS) that the NLRB should adopt a policy of preferring to place law faculty in a bargaining unit separate from other university faculty. This brief demonstrates that the law faculty's sense of identity and community of interests are separate and apart from that of the rest of the faculty. It shows that, in comparison with other faculty, the law teacher comes from a different kind of academic work experience background, conducts himself in a manner that reflects his special responsibilities to the legal  profession, is rewarded under separate promotional and salary criteria, teaches a very unique group of students, utilizes distinctive teaching methods, and operates within a different type of curriculum. In light of these and other circumstances, it is evident that the welfare of legal education and the legal profession are best served by finding that law faculty are in a separate voting unit.

        "description":"Higher education was perhaps the nation's largest growth industry during the period 1955-1970. Budgets for all higher education institutions rose more than seven-fold, from an estimated $4 billion in 1955 to an estimated total of $28 billion in 1970-71. Current fund income rose more than five-fold to $19 billion, an average annual increase of 13.5% for the period 1955-56 to 1965-66. Federal monies granted to higher education institutions increased from $500 million in 1955 to $4.4 billion in 1968. College and university administrators tended to gamble that funds from outside sources would continue to come in; however, the private institutions are not experiencing financial difficulties based on an actual decrease of funding. This paper explains some of the current aspects of the  financial crunch with regard to the manner in which it affects individual colleges and universities in the South. It also indicates some of the steps that colleges and universities are taking or must take in order to improve their short- and long-term financial condition, and underlines possible positive outcomes of financial adversity.

Efficiency for individual students was defined by five variables: (1) years required to complete degree requirements, (2) terms enrolled in to complete degree requirements, (3) upper-division terms enrolled in after achieving junior status, (4) total credit registered and paid for to complete degree requirements, and (5) accumulated grade point average upon completing degree requirements. The analysis was based on the assumption that excessive years, upper-division terms, and total credits registered and paid for to complete degree requirements were  costly to students, parents and tax payers. WMU graduates for 1970 were divided into three classifications: (1) native students; (2) transfer students; and (3) students not designated as native or transfer. Official school records were the data source for comparing native and transfer students on the five variables. Arithmetic means were analyzed using the t test statistic, and results tended to imply that it was not less costly for students to attend a junior college for their first two years. (AL)",

The general method was to compare scores obtained on each of the tests by a student with his GPA at the end of the term. Analysis included computing means, standard deviations, simple correlations, multiple correlations, and multiple stepwise regression for appropriate test scores, GPA's, and other variables for different programs. Results showed that no test was a good predictor of GPA. The second report  concerned itself with collecting socio-economic data for the student body. A family information form was designed for optional completion by parents of day students. Sixty-four percent of the total day enrollment returned the form.

The consequences of an administrator's initial selection of faculty can have lasting significance for a new institution, but there has been no single set of guidelines to help administrators set up procedures. This report reviews the literature and summarizes recommendations about all the stages of the employment process, from the initial decision about what kind of faculty members would be appropriate for the college to the actual hiring procedures. It stresses that the college begin by developing a document describing the basic college goals and philosophy. Secondly, the existing college staff should list minimum requirements and desirable characteristics of new faculty  such as level of education, geographic background, age and experience. Other topics discussed include traditional sources of community college faculty, methods of searches, limitations and obstacles to recruitment, and use of promotional materials. Recommendations to prospective faculty on how to write resumes and on the use and problems of interviews are included. (LP)",

The demonstration project was aimed at college administrators, boards, and other government officials. It was believed that increased education for minority peoples would result in greater income for them and subsequent local government betterment. A wide variety of programs and project activities affecting different aspects of community life were initiated. They were classified as operational, planning, and exploratory programs; and ancillary, demonstration, and  funding project activities. Four operational programs were reported on: (1) establishment of Community Learning Innovation Centers; (2) forming the Worcester Center for Community Studies; (3) beginning a community newspaper; and (4) implementing a remedial-tutorial program.

Services should be available in each of the following program areas: personal medical, mental health, and other direct health care, including community-oriented preventive services; environmental surveillance and control; and health education. In meeting this standard, however, it is not necessary for a community college to directly provide services in all these areas; it may be possible to create and maintain a comprehensive and effective health program through coordination of medical, environmental, and educational services which are available  throughout the community. The document reviews the procedures for setting up a comprehensive health program in a community college, describes in depth the various services and activities to be included, discusses the health personnel and physical plant necessary for a complete program, and reviews the business management procedures of a good health program.

Economic causes contributing to the crisis include inflation, rising enrollments, and such labor-intensive aspects as spiraling labor and security costs, and increasing demands for funds by such programs as those serving the disadvantaged and the community. At the same time agencies dealing with social security, ecological balance, environmental preservation, and recreational facilities among others have become powerful competitors for funds. The third major contributor to the crisis is the public who increasingly has been showing its disaffection with education by defeating public referendums and bond proposals. For these  reasons the author describes insolvency as a real threat for the first time since the depression, and stresses that the role of education is being questioned on all fronts by society as never before in American history.

Included are dropout statistics, reported reasons for leaving college, and personality characteristics of dropouts versus persisters. Comparisons between numbers of dropouts at junior and 4-year, public and private, large and small, and co-ed and single sex colleges were made. The conclusion is that small enrollment schools (250-750), whether 2- or 4-year, enjoy higher retention rates. The personality profiles of dropouts reported in the literature surveyed here are not consistent, although it is generally believed that high dropout rates in junior colleges are primarily attributable to the lower  level of motivation and poorer academic preparation of students. The value of special programs for potential dropouts and types of college environments which seem to foster higher dropout rates are also discussed. (LP)",

The major objectives specified for the first year of the program were to establish a national demonstration model and to demonstrate the effectiveness of (1) alternate semester, parallel and extended-day plans, (2) recruitment, development and coordination procedures, (3) disadvantaged student recruitment and maintenance, (4) technical, business and paraprofessional manpower recruitment  and training, and (5) &quot;outreach&quot; instruction and counseling. Within this framework, 24 lesser goals and objectives were specified for the exemplary program.

The results show that 1970 presidents, contrasted with presidents in 1960 and 1964 studies, will not stay as long in that position, are more likely to have come from a previous community college job, are more likely to have a doctoral degree and to have earned it in education. The 1970 survey revealed that presidents  viewed their previous experience in educational administration as the most important factor in their being hired and listed \"educational challenge\" as the foremost reason for accepting the job. Fifty percent did not aspire to another position, but of the 50% who did, half preferred another junior college presidency and half a university or 4-year college professorship.

The review of materials goes back to 1920, documenting the concern of the professoriate for achieving some form of participative governance in higher education generally, but junior college faculty are differentiated from higher education faculty as to attitudes toward school governance. It was noted that by 1965, new external forces entered the domain of higher education, modifying the heretofore relatively passive behavior of faculty toward their involvement in the decision making process, particularly in junior colleges. The new forces were characterized as unionization, collective bargaining, and strikes. To test the  effect of these new forces on the structure and status of the groups involved, a purposeful selection of six Michigan community colleges was conducted. Eight respondents from each school were selected representing varying views towards unionization and collective bargaining. Four major findings were reported: (1) changes in decision making related to faculty welfare have occurred since 1965, (2) few changes in decision making related to academic affairs have been taken place, (3) size or structure of an organization or group has little relationship to its internal political characteristics, and (4) in many instances, a more tightly structured bureaucracy has resulted from faculty pressures in collective negotiations.

The methods for selecting material from a document are not well defined. A search of the literature produced only thirteen documents which deal with manually produced extracts.

The value  of extracts as measured by how they lead the user to relevant documents was experimentally demonstrated. The purpose of the guidelines is to help the librarian and information specialist produce an informative extract. There was no substantial evidence that extracting is less costly than abstracting.

The following operational definition is proposed as a guide for the reorganization that will have to be undertaken within the next year. &quot;The library collections are to be viewed as a unit with their organization to be based on format and our use of universal classification system.&quot; (MM)",

Although the practices discussed were established for a museum library, what is said will apply equally to any other type of small library. The principles of organizing a library are presented in sequential order, with text kept to a minimum; this is, in effect, a manual of procedure. The rules, in most cases, have been greatly simplified; individuals without formal library training will still be able to establish a satisfactory library. The purpose of this simplification is the idea that time equals money. The  easier it is for the cataloger and typist to carry out their jobs, the more work will be done.

But this view has tended to overlook a third fundamental aspect: that of the \"works\" which are embodied in the materials and in turn embody the information. The paper discusses the meaning of this aspect and its implications in the control of information. (Author)",

To contribute to an understanding of these ends, the present study considers the role of the catalog in relation to the library's operations and services, the function of the catalog as it has evolved over the past century, and the specific objectives which the catalog has come to serve in view of its role and function in the library.

        "description":"Two specific approaches of how to evaluate an information retrieval system are explored. The first is a mathematical model for use in studying how to minimize operating costs. The model provides a method for comparative evaluation between systems. The cost model divides the costs of a retrieval system into two components: system costs and user costs. The second approach is the development of a simulation model as a preliminary step toward the creation of a tool for system design and evaluation. The simulation program creates a well specified collection of documents and analyzes the effect of changes in query file characteristics on system performance. Employing the thesaurus, pseudo-documents and pseudo-queries are compared to see the effect of various query file parameter  changes on the quantity of material retrieved. Evaluation of the simulation output indicates that there are small differences between the results of the experimental runs. It is concluded that one method for generating pseudo-queries is not clearly better than another. It is believed, however, that the simulation model as an approach to the evaluation of retrieval systems provides a limited but useful framework for the evaluation of information retrieval systems.

The metropolitan Atlanta area was selected because it includes in an accessible geographical area the entire range of types of institutions which provide reference services in a sufficiently large number to be significant. This report is a descriptive study of the reference services of selected libraries and of selected users of those services. The study attempted to: (1) identify current reference measurement and evaluation techniques; (2) elicit statements concerning the use of reference statistics; (3) determine the library interest in standards for reference  services; and (4) measure user satisfaction. The following recommendations are made to the Reference Standards Committee: (1) emphasize qualitative rather than quantitative measures of service, though minimum quantitative standards should be included; (2) users needs should be the most important consideration; (3) standards should initiate a self-evaluation; and (4) formulate uniform reference standards for all types of libraries.

The difficulties encountered in NTIS are symptomatic of problems in the entire government information system. Significant improvements in the system as a whole, or in NTIS as a part of that system, can only be accomplished by significant changes in the handling of government sponsored publications. It is proposed that all government research reports be processed and indexed by a network of information centers and that these centers feed their documents  and bibliographic tapes into NTIS. It is further proposed that NTIS become the national distribution center for all unrestricted research reports and that it be responsible for the printing and distribution of separate indexes to these reports. To accomplish this, NTIS must make major changes; its relationship to the rest of the Federal information community must be restructured; and it must act as the cohesive core of a network.

The third phase, reported here, had three goals: (1) study and define library operations susceptible to automation; (2) survey and describe in meaningful terms, the current techniques of automation which are potentially useful in library applications and (3) establish criteria for  making determinations as to feasibility, functions to be automated, types of hardware and software to be used, internal and external services, and extent of involvement with other systems. The three major tasks of this phase were: (1) a survey of the Federal library community, (2) preparation of a handbook to guide Federal librarians in automation feasibility and planning and (3) preparation of a report summarizing the survey results, and automation findings, and presenting recommendations for phase four.

The questionnaire invited comments concerning the student's reaction to his year or more in an American library school; what benefits did he derive, what were his satisfactions and frustrations, his handicaps and shortcomings, his expectations whether or not realized, his difficulties on and off campus, his disappointments, and his ability to apply his American education to his subsequent career. Though most of the respondents expressed general satisfaction, there were numerous criticisms and suggestions for change. Since many of the  criticisms echoed those of some American graduates who questioned the rationale of library education as typically offered, a chapter presents a conception of library education as an intellectual discipline, applicable to American and foreign students alike.

The Mini-Computer core cycle, instruction execution speeds, and disc operating speeds are quite similar to the much larger 360-30 and 40 while its magnetic tape speeds are somewhat slower. The most serious comparison discrepancy is the much reduced quantity of magnetic core in the Mini-Computer System. In a cost comparison, the Mini-Computer Processor is notably lower in hardware cost. Comparisons of computer costs and performance capability show that the Mini-Computer System performs every basic computer operation at a substantially lower cost. What is needed is a recognition of real application potential by  users and producers and a core efficient software system such as the &quot;Pyramid Interpreter System&quot; in which a compiler is used to generate a &quot;macro&quot; code rather than a machine code. Summarizing the results, not only can a Mini-Computer System perform comparably with present-day business computers, but it can do it at only 10% to 25% of the cost. A tabular comparison is shown which accounts for the core enhancing and speed reducing affects of the Pyramid Interpreter System. (Author/NH)",

In all, 704 pre- and post-tests were obtained. The purpose of the testing was to assess one of the goals of the Head Start Program: to enrich the experience of preschool children and to develop those cognitive and social skills which are regarded as essential to success in school. The results showed that, as measured by the Bettye Caldwell Test, Head Start for Los Angeles County was an effective program for developing those skills which are regarded as essential to success in school. The gains are clearly evident in the comparison of pre- and post-test means, in the shifting of the means to higher percentiles on the  lower and middle class norms, and on the steady increase in the means with increasing attendance in the program.

More specific objectives are to: substitute effective for ineffective behavior; increase the child's ability to function happily and well through an improved self-concept; improve interpersonal relationships between children, parents, and teachers by increasing communication skills; develop in children, teachers and parents skill in activating the problem-solving process; learn the relationship between feelings and behavior; involve children in decisions about their own behavior and learning; teach children to give accurate feedback as to their feelings and learning  process, so that they can be helped more effectively; and help teachers and parents function more effectively as facilitators of learning. The major thrust of the project during the first year was the initial outline and development of the behavioral science curriculum for children in kindergarten through the third grades. Other activities included the selection of the experimental school and controls; orientation meetings; and development of a summer workshop for project teachers and principals. A detailed plan for evaluating changes in the adjustment of the children involved was completed. (Author/DB)",

In studies of correlations between IE and intelligence test scores, results show that the scores increase regularly with age, from age 4 through 8, and there are fairly consistent, if low, correlations with intelligence, with Internal children showing higher intelligence test scores than External children. With pre-school age subjects, using the SDRCI measures, Internals learned a mirror-tracing task more rapidly than Externals. No straightforward relationship of IE to persistence on an intellectual task was found--it tended to be positively related for girls but negatively related for boys. In studies of  the socioeconomic and cultural determinants of early IE development, the first are studied was whether disadvantaged children show more External expectancies than middle class children as early as preschool age. Findings show that the IE problem of disadvantaged children is clear as early as beginning-Head Start age. Strong effects of economic status on IE was evidenced. In addition, strong cultural differences among economically disadvantaged groups were found. Some subtler and more complicated cultural effects were reversing sex differences and , in one case, a dependency of IE responses on interviewer ethnicity. (DB)",

Generally, a criterion performance on  reasoning tasks was achieved by retardates at a later mental age than that noted for normals; and (4) The sequence of task accomplishments established in this study is essentially the same as that reported in Swiss studies by the Geneva group.

No conversation was depicted in the cartoon sequences; the number of frames varied from 9 to 11. Included in the frames were nonverbal cues indicative of an appropriate emotion and behavior which was based on the emotion. The stories varied in the degree of sophistication required to interpret them. After each child viewed a cartoon sequence,  he was asked to tell the story twice, as the child saw it and as the other people in the story would tell it. After viewing all 12 sequences, each subject was given a Peabody Vocabulary Test. Results show that the technique permits assessment of individual developmental rates and sequences, as well as antecedents and consequents of emotional interpersonal insight. (DB)",

Results of the data analysis show: (1) the children showed significantly different preferences for the Optimal sound level in each of the four conditions, which  indicated a relatively high degree of precision as the loudness levels differed by only about 10dB; (2) the language-impaired children were not significantly different from the normals in their preference for the optimal loudness; (3) the language impaired children were significantly less attentive to the sight and sound stimuli than were the normals, and made significantly higher response durations at the higher loudness levels; and (4) the normal children sought the stimulus feedbacks in larger, more inclusive informational units than did the language impaired children.

        "description":"This study continued to replicate and extend research dealing with children's perceptions of vulnerability to health problems. Responses of 774 children, 8 to 17 years old, to 15 questions about the likelihood of encountering various health problems confirmed previous results indicating that perceived vulnerability is consistent across health problems. Perceptions of vulnerability were predictably less consistent in younger children than in older ones. Moreover, a consistent pattern of expectancies was found that was not affected by age, sex, or socioeconomic factors measured in terms of area of residence. These results have relevance for public health professionals concerned with the content and timing of educational programs. Evidence continues to suggest that health educators  interested in heightening children's perceptions of vulnerability, as a first step in shaping or inducing adaptive health behaviors, might find it appropriate to deal with a child's entire set of such perceptions rather than with the expectancies of one particular problem. There is some evidence that suggests that dental health education programs be included in a comprehensive health education program. (Author/DB)",

Research reveals that from the ages of two through four, and often through five also, the child's speech is primarily lacking in communicative message. It is found that the major difference in accounting for patterns of communication across ages is that the young child is egocentric. The adolescent is said to differ from the child in that reciprocity is denied through personal limitations. For the adult, like his adolescent counterpart, communication is seen as serving to enhance exclusive memperships and thus again reciprocity is denied through personal limitations. Research findings suggest that the three constituents of  communication that are critical to the free exchange of ideas and the development of functional linguistic ties are reciprocity, openness, and genuineness.

In Experiment I, three methods of dealing with the identified emotionally disturbed child were compared, simultaneously testing the hypothesis that community personnel can be taught to work effectively with these children. Under the three treatments, the identified child was either: (1) removed from his classroom and bussed to a special site, (2) retained in the regular classroom but taken into a special room each day to spend 20-30 minutes with a trained therapist, and (3) retained in the classroom, but with the constant support of a paraprofessional aide. In Treatment 1, these referrals had been made without consulting the research staff. For Treatment 2 and Treatment 3, stratified random assignment was made to either treatment from  a large number of children identified and observed by the psychologist and the therapists. There were a total of 68 children in the combined treatment and control groups. Experiment II compared the preschool population of two clinic schools using a similar psychodynamic approach. One aspect of the investigation was designed to determine whether there were any basic differences in the type of emotional problems which characterized children from different socioeconomic backgrounds. In Experiment I, the success attained showed that community personnel can help slightly disturbed children. Although the second Experiment was never fully implemented, there seems to be sufficient basic to conclude that the problem behaviors of young children are very similar, regardless of backgrounds.

Twelve subjects were trained in trios for six sessions on tasks requiring complete description of a design for a listener to reproduce, and tasks requiring communication of critical information for a listener to discriminate the same design from a set. Roles of speaker, listener, and observer were alternated, followed by peer discussion. Compared to 12 control subjects, trained subjects at posttesting had significantly greater useful information and overall evaluation of messages, and showed a moderate transfer of skills. (Author)",

A specific question researched is \"How do children use their hands as perceptual tools for exploring objects in order to acquire information about them?\" It was assumed that a pre-school child would have evolved a form of eye-hand cooperation, and given a shape recognition problem, would show how he has produced a division of labor between the work done by his hands and the work done by his eyes. A procedure was formulated that would allow comparison of what hand exploration is like under haptic perception, with what hand exploration is like when the S may perceive shape through the combined use of haptic plus visual exploration. Two sets of materials were used--a set of  wooden shapes and a set of 10 free-form solid shapes. Sixty children between 4 and 5 years were studied in connection with both sets of materials. It was found that the children used their hands as pedestals more than as perceptual tools; the dominant approach was to use the hands to position the object for visual inspection. The quality of hand use was almost fully subordinated to the function of visual inspection. The children showed minimal haptic exploration of the objects.

The program is currently being implemented in four communities embraces a philosophy of cognitive transactionalism, a philosophy molded by the work of Jean Piaget and others. This philosophy states that &quot;the child is born with a set of sensory motor operations (or responses) to perform on his environment in order to know it himself.&quot; The major foundation upon which the program rests is the parent's presentation of materials which engage the child in learning activity. Tasks should have the following qualities: (1) The learner does a lot of talking; (2) The learner has fun doing the task; (3) The directions are clear enough that it can be taught by the mothering one; (4)  Teacher and learner understand why they are performing the task; (5) The task encourages the teacher to use a lot of ways to teach; (6) Home materials are used; (7) The learner knows he has learned something; and (8) The learner is encouraged to think up new activities or things to do which grow out of the task. The broad objectives of the Parent Educator program are to develop educational competence in the child, enhance the cognitive development of the child, and help to generate a home atmosphere which will allow the child to be resilient to the demands which schools make on him. The program is more focused on the process employed by mothering ones when teaching their children than on the specific product outcome associated with any given task. (CK)",

The program reported on the Tucson Early Education Model, a comprehensive educational program which encompasses all of the criterial attributes of the open classroom as specified in the introduction to this paper. Specifically, this paper specifies how certain psychological principles may be used to provide an effective learning environment for young children. In the natural environment children acquire many complex skills, largely through observational learning. The teacher who is aware of the ways in which modeling influences children, and of the conditions which facilitate the effects of modeling, is in a position to influence the growth of  children in a very positive and natural way. Another way in which the environment can teach is by providing cues, i.e., objects or events in the environment which, as the child learns to discriminate them, signal appropriate behavior. A third characteristic of an effective learning environment is that it reinforces children for their purposeful and constructive behavior. An important assumption in the program is that responsibility for learning must in the final analysis rest with the student. (CK)",

        "description":"Sporadically, across the country, experimental day care centers for the very young child (eight weeks to three years of age) are coming into existence. Some authorities in the child development and child welfare field advocate this move because they believe that infant day care is the head start deprived children need; and that the present head start programs begin too late. Other people in the field think that day care for the young child can only be destructive to babies, because they will be given only \"institutional care.\" They do not believe that small group care of young children can provide the baby with individual, consistent, warm mothering care that he needs for normal development. The pros and cons of day care for the young child are based on: a review of recent child  development research; the evaluation and discussion of experimental day care programs in the United States; and, the author's experience in planning an infant day care center. This is followed with a discussion of various roles for social workers in the policy formation, funding and licensing area, as well as their vital function in the actual operation of a day care center for young children.

The Southern Regional Education Board has responsibility for coordinating the project, providing training and assistance, and evaluating the program over the three-year period. Specifically, this report is one of a series of bulletins around a variety of topics related to day care. The point is made that the need to expand day care services nationally has focused attention on some of the problems and inconsistencies associated with application of existing day care licensing regulations. Concurrent with another study, the Southeastern Day Care Project (SDCP) has reviewed current practices in family day care licensing in the eight states of the Project. The reasons for this review include: (1) Expanding day care  services need to have their standards reviewed; (2) Children need to be protected from placement in situations that present possible danger to their health, safety, and development; and (3) Numerous problems have arisen in the SDCP states when securing of family day care licenses was attempted in connection with federally funded programs. The general difficulty encountered in obtaining licensing has been a deterrent to the development of family day care and a factor in preventing residents of housing projects in the region to proceed with service. Current day care standards were reviewed to resolve some of these problems. This review has revealed that rigid provisions in licensing may impede the provision of a needed service. It is proposed that day care homes receiving government funds  be registered instead of licensed. (CK)",

Research revealed that middle class children tended to respond in classification tasks to objects and pictures as equivalents, whereas low class black children tended not to do so. The reason for this was investigated. This investigation of the course of development of representational thinking is of import for theoretical and practical reasons: (1) to enhance understanding of a crucial cognitive phenomena, and (2) to provide diagnostic and remediational procedures to insure continued growth and mastery of symoblic activities. Examination of the literature and of parent child data suggested that the children from impoverished environments had less experience in utilizing those processes that  are inherent in representational thought, i.e., anticipation, planning, articulation of events in linguistic terms, etc. The basic hypothesis emerged that exposing children to distancing behavior should enhance the development of representational skills. The decision was made to work with two-year-olds in a nursery-school-type setting to give them a chance to engage in representational thought. It became clear very early in the program that the children could and did engage in group-type behaviors and were increasingly involved in a small group setting. (CK)",

Two aspects of this development are concentrated on. These are (1) phonological accomodation of English and Gujarati in a changing and increasing system, and (2) concentration of English lexemes in specific semantic domains within a basically Gujarati-oriented grammar. It is clear that the child' comprehension of English is greater than either her grammatical competence or her ability to produce novel utterances. In Gujarati grammar, the child is beginning to acquire several inflectional patterns and is fully capable of appropriately constructing several types of Gujarati sentences. Gujarati and English are distantly related as  Indo-European languages, and their phonological systems have many points of similarity. Though the child uses very few English verbs as yet, she responds appropriately to a considerable number in questions, imperatives, and requests. If she gives the Gujarati term for any object and is asked for the English, she will often supply it. There are some parallels between first and second language learning in this young child. Two strong complementary forces in her learning would seem to be the urge to collect more and more data, or perhaps the nearly complete receptivity to incoming information, along with the increasing need to simplify handling it by means of systematization.

Project objectives are: (1) To develop a set of handbooks that describe the features common to good child development and education programs for use in day care, and include effective curriculum models from current practice; (2) To develop a set of principles that can serve as a useful guideline to the operation of day care programs; (3) To develop an additional set of handbooks that deal with Day Care Administration, Parent Involvement, Health Services, and Training, and (4) To modify current resources in child development, early education, and day care in order to improve existing programs. The project operated under the joint efforts of two organizations. Under the leadership of the Project Director, an  Advisory Committee helped to lay the groundwork for the attainment of project objectives through a series of preworkshop, summer workshop, and postworkshop activities. Results of the project include the preparation of a series of handbooks for various facets of day care operation, the collation of information about current program models, and the development of 65 resource materials. Operational recommendations include: (1) Budget adequately; (2)Develop a comprehensive master plan; (3) Manage the components carefully; (4) Have a multidisciplinary approach; and (5) Integrate the components into a whole. Action recommendations include: (1) Provide adequate funds for the development of high-quality school age day care programs; and (2) Provide the necessary funds for developing materials  that deal with ethnic identify and cultural heritage.

Seventy-two first-grade children served as Ss. Two sets of stimuli were used: line drawings of cats and line drawings of children's faces. Although none of the pretraining conditions had a facilitating effect for Ss seeing the faces, there were significant facilitative effects for Ss seeing cats. Specifically, the three pretraining conditions involving same-different judgments facilitated both learning  and reversal, whereas the effect of \"observing response alone\" pretraining had no such facilitative effect.

Fifty-five kindergarten children, who were shown by pretesting to possess negligible double classification skills, were trained over a period of two months on matrix tasks involving color and shape dimensions. The subjects were divided into four groups and were either: (a) trained on three matrix tasks in the hypothesized optimal sequence (simplest to most complex); (b)  trained on the same three tasks in the reverse sequence; (c) given overtraining on the simplest task followed immediately by training on the most complex task. The results strongly supported the existence of a hierarchical relationship among the three tasks. More subjects learned the most complex task, and they learned it in fewer trials, when taught in the optimal order. No subject learned a higher-level task without also having learned the lower-level one. High, though not complete, positive transfer to a different double classification task was also demonstrated for those subjects who learned the most complex task in the hierarchy. (Author)",

        "description":"This document reports on recent research in the United States in the field of early childhood education. The point is made that this research is characterized by conflicting ideologies and rapid change. This conflict revolves around such issues as the relative importance of direct instruction and incidental learning, the emphasis on cognitive learning as opposed to a more broadly based curriculum, and the emphasis on education for the future versus education more presently oriented. Researchers have been concerned with the effect of early childhood education on later school achievement. A decided factor in the results appears to be the degree of continuity or discontinuity between the early childhood and the later school program. A great deal of research supports the importance  of the model which the parent sets for the child. In addition, the role assumed by the teacher makes a big difference. Teachers who are more resourceful stimulate more student cooperation, involvement, and activity. Early childhood education has also been widely accepted among its advocates as a contributor to better human relations. The growth of new early childhod education programs seems to be on the upsurge in the United States. Much of this growth is described as chaotic. However, it is concluded, education must contribute to the young child's self-fulfillment in the broadest sense, and early childhood education is a challenge to our best creative thinking. (CK)",

        "description":"The central purpose of this research was to provide vocational educators in general, and agricultural educators in particular, with insights into the occupational aspirations, expectations, and interests of rural male seniors. Specific objectives of the research were (1) to compare occupational aspirations, expectations, and interests of seniors who had 1 or more years of vocational agriculture (vo-ag) instruction to those who had no such instruction and (2) to study factors relating to occupational aspiration/expectation differentials among and between vo-ag and non-vo-ag seniors. Data were gathered from 517 seniors principally from classroom questionnaires administered during April and May of 1967 by vo-ag instructors or counselors. Two groups formed the basis for analysis. The  first group was composed of 117 non-vo-ag seniors, and the second group was composed of 400 vo-ag seniors. Analysis was conducted by employing the chi-square statistical technique in 3 major phases. The first phase consisted of analyzing the occupational interests of seniors. In the second phase, the occupational aspirations and expectations of seniors were analyzed. In the final phase, factors related to occupational aspiration/expectation differentials among and between vo-ag and non-vo-ag seniors were analyzed. Some of the findings were that seniors in the vo-ag group indicated highest degrees of interest in being employed in the agricultural, construction, manufacturing, and transportation and utilities industries and that seniors in the non-vo-ag group indicated highest degrees of  interest in being employed in the construction, government, and manufacturing industries.

Of the reported 65,000 migrant students who attended Texas schools, approximately half attended 45 specially funded project schools. These 45 project schools and 45 non-project schools were visited by staff from the Southwest Laboratory and professional consultant-observers who spent more than 2,000 hours of direct on-site visitation time and conducted interviews with some 1,300 respondents--including administrators, teachers, migrant parents, migrant students, and various support personnel. Although the study indicated that the project schools were more adequately meeting the educational and  social needs of the migrant child than were non-project schools, the following needs and problems common to any migrant population were identified: mobility, retardation in age-grade placement and achievement, language barriers, poverty, dysfunctional information transfer system, community non-involvement, dysfunctional personality characteristics, high dropout rate, and dysfunctional school responses to migrants. Some of the important implications of the study included the need for parent and community involvement in school affairs, capable staffing, curriculum adjusted to the special needs of the migrant child, programs to help the secondary school attract and retain the migrant student, primary-grade language development, and community services such as health, medical, dental, and  nutritional care.

The project was designed to expand career exploration and availability of occupational information to the lower and middle grades, to increase opportunities for work experience and cooperative education, to provide for specialized skill training of students prior to leaving school, and to initiate a placement service integrated with the counseling function within the school system. An attitude scale administered to teachers, administrators, and students in grades 9 through 12 yielded high group means indicating positive attitudes toward vocational education. Preliminary analyses of an attitudes toward self and others scale, administered to students in grades 9 throgh  12, showed reliability coefficients to be .865 and .655 for items measuring attitude toward self and others, respectively. Baseline data (by grade level) with which to measure changes at a later date were obtained by a 3-item instrument asking students in grades 1 through 5 to list as many occupations as they could, the occupations of members of the immediate family, and as many good work habits as they could; students in grades 6 through 12 responded to the latter 2 items. Baseline and/or historical data are also presented for the number of high school course offerings in vocational areas and the percentages of students applying for postsecondary education, students requesting career guidance services, parental conferences with guidance personnel, students using the occupational  information centers, dropouts, average daily attendance, and grade failures.

The staff consisted of a director, 3 instructors, and various unpaid volunteers. A continuation of the program through 2 years following the summer session had 4 functions: to maintain contact with the students and their  parents; to help the students improve their grades by providing tutoring; to assist students in applying for college admission and financial aid; and to inform selected colleges about the program and the students who have participated. A follow-up study of the 21 students who entered the program in 1969 showed that 12 began college in the fall of 1971 and 1 entered a professional school.

Program changes for the second year included more teacher and counselor involvement in student selection; an increase in the number of students participating (from 21 to 26); payment of the program director's salary by the Denver Public Schools; and administration of various vocational interest tests administered to the students. The  4-week summer session consisted of discussion groups, lectures, and laboratories on such topics as astronomy, social protest, Hispano history, physics, and psychology. The winter follow-up program consisted of social events and a tutoring program. The document contains a program description and responses of 25 students to an evaluation questionnaire.

        "description":"The Office of Economic Opportunity funded a program to train administrators for schools serving large numbers of Indian children. The program, which called for the support and training of 20 American Indians in programs leading to degrees and certification in school administration, was aimed at alleviating the shortage of school administrators having Indian ancestry. Graduates of the program were to have the training needed to provide leadership in Indian education for local districts, state departments of education, and Federal agencies. Through these educational and leadership opportunities, program graduates would be able to play a more active role in self-determination and improved socioeconomic opportunity through education in Indian communities. During the summer of 1970,  20 program applicants (17 candidates for master's degrees and 3 candidates for doctor's degrees) were selected for admission to graduate school and participation in the fellowship program at the University of Minnesota. Achievement and progress toward degree objectives were encouraged through intensive advising and program planning. Effectiveness of the program was evaluated in terms of its primary goal: training administrators for Indian education. Based on this criterion, the program was deemed successful. The components of the evaluation were student retention, academic achievement, attainment of degree objectives, participant evaluation, and post-program plans. (JH)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine whether there were identifiable differences in the characteristics of 3 groups of youths: (1) those who remained in the same or adjoining counties (nonmigrants), (2) those who migrated to other areas of the South, and (3) those who migrated to areas outside the South. Included in the sample were 700 youths who left 1,000 sample households in the northeast coastal plains area of South Carolina within a 10-year period prior to a 1966 survey of these households. The 299 white youths and 401 Negro youths were not contacted directly. Instead, heads of sample households were asked a series of questions about the youth who left the households in the 1956-66 period. Household heads were also asked questions relating to their aspirations and  expectations for all their children, whether they were already gone or were still at home. Household income and age, sex, education, and occupation of the household head were also ascertained. Analysis of questionnaire data employed the chi-square technique. It was found that migration was highly selective with respect to both race and education. Negroes were more prone to migrate than whites and, when they migrated, were more likely to move outside the South. Migrant whites and Negroes had more education and training than nonmigrants of the same race. Only half of the white youths migrated from the area compared to more than 3/4 of the Negroes. A strong positive relationship existed between education and outmigration for girls of both races. A significant relationship between education  and outmigration was also found for Negro boys but not for white boys. (LS)",

Also central to the meeting of camp goals was the life-style itself, which consisted of family-style meals, community living and bathing facilities, and competitive endeavors such as team sports and cabin competition. Evaluation of the program included the administration of the Coppersmith Self-Esteem Inventory, the All About  Myself Scale, the Children's Form of the Manifest Anxiety Scale, and pre- and post-questionnaires relating directly to the camp experience.

        "description":"The objective of this study was to explore the feasibility of analyzing educational and cultural factors associated with the vocational success of graduates of a large boarding school for Navajo Indians (i.e., the 1964 graduates of Intermountain School in Utah). In order to locate these graduates, letters were sent to the parents or guardian. When this brought no response, an interviewer was sent to the reservation to speak to parents, other family members, or the local trader to obtain current addresses for the graduates. An interview schedule was developed, tested on Navajos living on or near the reservation, and revised. Information obtained from Intermountain School included the student's total amount of schooling, age when he started school, age when he graduated,  information concerning courses he had taken, grade point averages, test data for achievement and aptitude tests, evaluation which had been made by counselors and teachers on various aspects of the student's life and behavior, and information on the summer placement program. Included in the sample were 80 graduates, each of whom was personally interviewed. The data, analyzed by stepwise regression, indicated that the best variable for predicting total productive activity was teacher evaluation of the student's respect for property; the next best prediction variable was knowing the traditional Navajo stories. However, \"these results are only suggestive because of the smallness of the sample, but it appears that among the variables used in the study are those which can be meaningfully  combined to give an explanation of and be useful for predicting a reasonable percentage of relative vocational success among Navajo males.\" (LS)",

Individuals from the study area who were selected most consistently formed the final interviewing sample--a total of 84 non-Indians and 31 Indians.

Whether the 3 institutes brought about positive attitude change in the participants was selected as the basis of the evaluation, which used a non-equivalent control group design. There were 3 measures of teacher attitude: an adaptation of a semantic differential, a 50-item Likert-type scale, and a test devised for this study consisting of a series of paragraphs on a given topic representing a continuum of viewpoints. Participants' experiences during the workshops were monitored through use of post-meeting reaction sheets. Findings from the pre- and post-measures of attitude revealed (1) a significant gain for participants on the attitude scale and the paragraph test using analysis  of covariance on the data and (2) changes in attitudes on the semantic differential using a modified Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test on the data. Although an insufficient number of complete sets of post-meeting reaction sheets was received, limiting the nature of the recommendations that could be made, the sheets indicated generally positive reactions to events of the institutes. Also, continuation of the basic format of the institutes was encouraged; this included considerable use of consultants, the experience of working with migrant children in a special summer school, and the use of discussions throughout the institutes. Other recommendations included specifying more precisely what dimensions of attitude change are to be achieved by the institutes and planning some  experiences to achieve the changes. (Author/NQ)",

Statistics show that medical and social services provided by the program reached more migrant workers than in previous years; however, extension of program services to reach a still larger percentage of the migrant population will require more bilingual field personnel, more  clinic facilities, and transportation to bring patients to the necessary services. Efforts have been consistently applied to the implementation of project-supported sanitation; the potable water program and the installation of a water-borne sewage-disposal system evidence positive results. Community family counseling agencies increased assistance to migrant families in 1970, and areas of previously unmet need served better in 1970 included eye treatment and dental care.

The CEP's immediate objective is to retain students in college. Long-range goals are to increase the proportion of disadvantaged students at the university, to help them complete their education, to increase their rate of entry into the professions, to aid the university in examining the manner in which it acts upon young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, and to aid in the development of human skills and to promote the application of those skills  to real needs. Retention rate is the key measure used in the evaluation of the CEP. In addition, grade point average, development of reading skills, and development of study attitudes and study habits are examined. Evaluative research findings indicate that the CEP has had significant influence on the retention of disadvantaged students and has provided major impetus in motivating participating students to attain a college degree.

Also used in the study were results of a pilot project conducted with Mexican American pupils to compare the Semantic Differential Technique and the Self-Esteem Inventory in measurement of self-concept. Two dependent variables were studied: (1) total academic achievement on the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills and subtest scores in reading, language, and arithmetic and (2) total self-concept measured by the Semantic Differential Technique and the feelings toward nationality subtest. Independent variables were (1) comparison of the Bicultural  Group Counseling Treatment, designed to develop pupil pride in ethnic background, and the Traditional Group Counseling Treatment, which placed emphasis on school adjustment and improvement in academic achievement; (2) treatment effects on the school attended; (3) male and female effects produced by treatments; and (4) comparison of treatment effects on foreign-born and native-born pupils. This latter comparison was possible in only 1 school because of its almost equal proportion of foreign- and native-born students. Pre- and post-test scores were analyzed using analysis of covariance. Findings indicated that none of the variances for the treatments variable proved significant although significant interactions were found in several control variables. The pilot study reported a fairly  positive correlation between the Semantic Differential Technique and the Self-Esteem Inventory for measurement of self-concept. (Author/NQ)",

Results are described for the 10-week study (summer 1969) that consisted of observations of community reactions to proposals for changed conditions and in-depth interviews with the community political and educational leaders. According to the paper, Santa Clara has progressed much further toward controlling its schools than San Juan. It is noted that the primary factor probably responsible for the difference in degree of receptivity to local control over formal education between the 2 communities is that San Juan has maintained a theocratic government while  Santa Clara has instituted a political system in which secular and religious roles are separate. Other major factors include (1) a communication gap between San Juan's traditional governing body and the more progressive citizenry, (2) the absence of consolidated leadership among the general citizenry in San Juan to generate consensus over major issues, and (3) the allocation of final decisions to those San Juan community leaders who are least aware of modern demands. Conclusions concerning the Indian role in formal education are presented. (PS)",

The development proceeds from undifferentiation to differentiation, from unintentional to intentional, from unintelligent to intelligent, and includes cognitive processes beyond concrete experience that enables the child to master the ability to think symbolically. The symbolic functions are acquired through specialized development in accommodation and assimilation. The understanding of some of the principal characteristics of the child's cognitive orientation during the first 2 years in school could further success in reading and avoid possible reading failure. During this  period, the sensory-motor ancestry still dominates the child's cognitive life with all the attributes postulated by Piaget: concreteness, centration, irreversibility, egocentrism, and transductive reasoning. All these attributes may more or less interfere with the child's learning in general and reading in particular, and may therefore disrupt his developmental process which concerns the totality of his structures of knowledge.

Part of the reason for the seeming contradition may be that spelling requires precise knowledge of individual letter combinations whereas often as much meaning in reading can be obtained from context as from the makeup of individual words. Spelling is made more difficult by the inconsistencies of English pronunciation, by the discrepancies in numbers of letters and combinations of letters used to represent English sounds. Teachers and parents can be aware of several common types of spelling errors so that these can be corrected early in the learning of words. Good spelling habits are invaluable in learning to read.

Five approaches for teaching reading are described. (1) The developmental guided basal approach uses a systematized series of basal books, workbooks, tests, and reading aids. Different basal series may stress different methods: sight word method, intensive phonics program, balanced phonics, or the linguistics approach. (2) The highly individualized language experience approach emphasizes the child's own language and experience while reading is taught as one part of the total communication process. (3)  Individualized reading programs encourage children to read widely according to their own interests and levels. (4) Independent learning activities expose children to programed instruction, often mechanized, to learn reading independently at their own pace, and (5) The initial teaching alphabet provides 44 symbols to represent English sounds.

Visual difficulties are classified into two major categories: (1) refractive errors which include nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, and aniseikonia and (2) binocular errors which include the problems of adjusting the two eyes in relation to each other and color blindness. It is recommended (1) that every child's eyes be checked before he starts school to see that he will be able to read and undertake other reading-related activities without excessive strain and (2) that when a  child encounters trouble with reading, visual problems should be checked out as a possible factor.

It is recommended that, first of all, parents should develop a reading habit in themselves and fill the home with a sense of reading excitement and interest. Also, parents should look for situations which could lead to reading interest, listen to the children, correct the children's pronunciation, speak clearly to them, and show enthusiasm in the children's studying. The physical and emotional fitness of the children are emphasized. Recommendations are made of simple ways to make the children independent in reading, with a stress on the  parents' setting an example themselves.

Critical evaluation of 948 research studies was made using the Gephart model. Of these, 244 studies were judged acceptable. It was concluded that most teachers combined and adapted many methods and much equipment to their particular needs. The existence of so many methods and materials for teaching beginning reading, based on the assumption that if beginning reading instruction is successful all subsequent instruction will also be successful, led investigators to conclude that a change of focus is needed and that more studies need to be done on the effectiveness of specific methods with various groups of older  students. It was also concluded (1) that the rush to produce and acquire new materials should be replaced by more careful field tests of new materials before sale and more insistence on effectiveness before purchase; (2) that research on effectiveness of materials and methods should include adequate data on population studied, materials and methods used, and other information which can benefit teachers; and (3) that the present state of research leaves teachers with no evidence around which to design effective instructional methods.

The primary focus of the program is to serve second-grade children who are virtually nonreaders. An evaluation of the program was carried out through analysis of official records of the children in the program and a selected control group and through observations by qualified observers. Analysis of test results on 107 center children and 54 control children indicated an average gain in reading of 7 months for the center group versus an average gain of 2  months for the control group. Data gathered through observations and interviews also favored the program.

It was found (1) that fewer children sampled books as a result of the report requirement, but those who did tended to stick with one book and read it more thoroughly and (2) that the reward reinforcement system had a significant effect on encouraging reading and reporting. The second case study investigated a second-grade boy's extremely disruptive behavior in the classroom. Recorded data showed that when the teacher used positive social reinforcement and a token system to  encourage good behaviors, frequency of the disruptive behavior dropped immensely, but it climbed up again when the token system was discontinued.

Both, for example, believe in the necessity for careful early instruction, and both believe in the importance of reading as a skill. Differences exist in attitudes toward learning to read. The author characterizes the Americans as being more curriculum-centered--concerned with what has to be done and with reading as an academic discipline. On the other hand, he characterizes the British as being more child-centered--concerned with instruction and with the development of reading as a learning tool. (MS)",

Subjects were 40 first graders in suburban Pittsburgh who had attended kindergarten together. A group of 16 of the 40 children were judged not ready (NR) for reading. They were divided randomly into experimental (E) and control (C) groups and distributed equally in two classrooms with other children (R). Experimental group children received 37 auditory perception sessions for 15 to 20 minutes daily until all had mastered requisite skills. The AAT was administered to all 40 children, and comparisons were made between R and NR groups and between  E anc C groups. Post-test results indicated significant differences between R and NR groups, between E and C groups, and between R and C groups, but not between R and E groups. Training apparently was effective in teaching phonic analysis skills necessary for successful performance on the AAT, and phonic skills were related to readiness. Tables and references are included.

It proposed to help teachers at every grade level to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to be successful in teaching word attack skills, but was mainly designed for elementary teachers. An evaluation of the program's effectiveness was carried out by sending questionnaires to teachers in the evaluation sample after the completion of their training. Data received from 148 elementary teachers and 55 junior high school teachers were analyzed. It was concluded that (1) the Croft approach to teaching word attack skills had value for both elementary and junior high teachers; (2) the children taught by the Croft approach improved their word  attack skills significantly; (3) the Croft diagnostic tests helped to diagnose student weaknesses quickly and accurately and provided an effective method of grouping according to skill needs; and (4) the Croft program can be used with junior high students, and the materials and methods are relevant. It was recommended that the Croft program be continued. Tables and appendixes are included. (AW)",

Intensive effort was made to provide teachers with special skills in classroom organization, teaching methodology, and the use of current materials and programs. Content reading skills were highlighted through establishment of curriculum laboratories in mathematics, social studies, and science. Teachers were introduced to language experience, linguistics, and individualized reading instruction techniques. The first days of the Institute were spent in establishing interpersonal relationships to emphasize effects of personal  interactions in the teaching-learning situation. An evaluation instrument was designed and administered to the participants to seek background information and to assess individual attitudes and expectations.

In the A-T approach, a tape-guided discussion is integrated with various student activities such as laboratory work, viewing film-loops, observing and conducting demonstrations, and solving problems. Self-pacing, integration of activities, concentration of effort, lessons which are tested presentations, variety of approaches, and immediate feedback are aspects of A-T which are stated as being very attractive. An outline of the development of A-T materials is given as starting with a trial effort in 1969-1970 and a larger trial in 1970-1971 including changes in  response to feedback. A description of the course and facilities are provided. The methods of evaluation are bi-weekly quizzes and oral presentations and discussion of laboratory reports. (Author/TS)",

The first part contains the major sections of the author's doctoral dissertation comparing the effects of two instructional problem-solving programs. The fifth grade students in six classes (three schools) were randomly assigned to the two programs: The Productive Thinking Program, a commercially-available sequence which develops general problem-solving skills and contains no mathematics; and the Modified Wanted-Given Program, an experimental sequence which emphasizes the structure of arithmetical problems. Both sequences were presented in programmed form and took 16 consecutive school days. Fifth grade students in two classes in a fourth school acted as a control group. Every student received a pretest, posttest and a follow-up test seven  weeks later. Each test battery measured several other skills besides problem solving. On an analysis of covariance, no significant differences were found between the two methods of instruction and the control, nor was any significant sex difference found. The second part of this report reviews the variables used in previous studies of problem solving using teletype terminals, and then applies the same regression techniques to verbal problems selected from the dissertation study described in the first part.

The system describes, rather than evaluates, teacher behaviors in the order in which they occur, in any subject at any level. It does not, however, include nonverbal behaviors and student-student interaction. A review of ten studies using the system in science classes provides evidence that the technique is useful for identifying some aspects of science teacher effectiveness. But, because of the limitations of the research design and the Flanders system, contradictory and inconsistent results, and inadequate descriptions of the design in many studies, no clear relationship between teaching style and teacher  effectiveness can be shown. Recommendations concerning appropriate criterion measures, modifications of Flanders' system, research design and reporting, and further questions for analysis, arise from the review. (AL)",

The evaluation covered four aspects: curriculum adequacy, material effectiveness, cost effectiveness, and learning effectiveness. The means used included the following: reports by Joseph Scandura and Robert Gagne on the IMS structure and methods (reprinted in full); teacher surveys at training workshops and three times during the year; reports and meetings of evaluation coordinators (one in each of the 23 participating schools); and  standardized student achievement tests. Estimates of pupil progress in IMS are extrapolated from the overall test results, and results in four selected schools are analyzed in more detail. Observations on the implementation and usage of the IMS materials are drawn from the verbal reports. The evaluation shows that IMS is meeting most of its goals, but several recommendations for specific improvements and extensions are derived. (MM)",

Findings included the following: the laboratory-theory sequence method was a better way to teach science concepts in the fourth grade; the theory-laboratory sequence method was a better way to teach science concepts in the sixth  grade; the concepts taught were too difficult for most fourth grade students but not too difficult for sixth grade students; concept retention after three months was extremely high for most of the students; sixth grade boys in the theory-laboratory sequence method scored significantly higher than girls; and there was no significant interaction between the treatment groups and IQ ability groupings.

Both experimental and control groups made significant gains from pre- to posttest on science achievement (Metropolitan Science Test, Advanced Level), but did not differ significantly from each other. The experimental group, however, attained higher levels of intellectual development; the experimental materials facilitated movement from the concrete to formal operations level.

Identity is viewed as the relationship between a person's self-role and other socio-political roles learned and valued by him in the course of his psychological development. A rationale section points up the relationship of the concepts identity and self to a war/peace curriculum, the objective of such a curriculum being to identify for the child those roles that seem most relevant to an understanding of conflict and order, and to do so in a way that encourages the child to place these roles high in the hierarchy of his own role-structure. A number of affective and cognitive objectives for a study of the concept of identity are enumerated, and a method of testing  for shifts in attitudes is suggested. A general discussion of role-theory follows, indicating how some of the research findings may be adapted to classroom use. A short, suggestive listing of social and political roles appropriate to the war/peace field is given, divided according to appropriate grade levels. Methods for helping the student grasp the place and prospect of these roles in his own life are indicated. Two subconcepts, position and personality, are also provided, with a definition, rationale, and objectives for each. An accompanying draft document summarizes the instructional objectives and idea outline for the concept identity. Related documents are: SO 001 511, SO 001 513, and SO 002 078. (Author/JLB)",

        "description":"Questions of identity, and the encounter with the draft, are central issues for teenagers, and secondary schools should be capitalizing upon such concerns to facilitate the general education and development of their students. The relationship between each student and the biggest problem of our times--war and peace--should be a thoroughly incorporated feature of the secondary curriculum. To talk about war and peace in the secondary school is to talk about the world. The realities for facilitating self identification with the world are fragmentary and undeveloped, but there are some psychological processes which may be used to suggest ways of relating the individual's self or ego with those few realities of the world community. These concepts are: a) identification,  b)socialization, and, c) role learning. If the theories of psychological identification are to be applied, we need to find and talk about world heroes and world leaders with whom they can identify. If the processes of political socialization are to be employed educationally, we need to identify and put the student in touch with agencies of world political socialization, even though in some instances, these are barely coming into being. If role theory is the conceptual perspective to be used, world roles that can be acquired or sought after by the teenager need to be specified and related to him as an individual. (Author/JLB)",

It focuses on the bargaining, citizen reaction, and possible side payments. Designed as a heuristic devise, the game focuses upon a number of issues: 1) inequities in the location of noxious public facilities; 2) the effect of citizen organization on governmental decision-making processes; 3) potential influence of money power on politics; 4) civil disobedience as an instrument of power; 5) the pressure of time on decision making; and, 6) the overall nature of group interaction with regard to locational decisions. The total number of players must be  at least fifteen, and an ideal number would fall between thirty and sixty. The three major sections of the paper are: 1) the game materials in their entirety; 2) instruction and comments on the organization of the game, illustrating possible outcomes and points to be highlighted in class discussions; and, 3) a commentary on one play of the game. The game has been played primarily with undergraduate students, but it is equally instructive for individuals more directly involved in locational decisions. (Author/JLB)",

The concept of conflict provides a rich tool for teachers to analyze much of human behavior. When applied intelligently, it can bridge the gap between very personal conflict situations and those remote conflicts occurring between nation states. Its study can also help teachers to manage the conflicts lying just beneath the surface of his classes. There are hundreds of ideas about conflict which can be examined in thousands of human events. Knowing that the reader will think of the many applications, the chief focus here is on the ideas. First, a definitional statement about conflict is  presented; one which encompasses a wide range of human behavior. Suggested also are several cognitive objectives, and some desirable attitudes toward conflict which you may want to develop in your students. A tentative model of the process of conflict and its resolution is offered, and ways of using this model as a basis for student activities are suggested. Finally, some other student activities are described which can provide some practical experience in recognizing and resolving conflicts. SO 001 509, SO 001 511, and SO 001 513 are related.

This is defined as a structured learning activity in which the learner is encouraged to learn for himself that which is to be learned or discovered. The discovery learning process was both the technique of his lesson and the object for discovery. The 26 students in the methods course were presented with an unidentified fable and given the task of identifying as much about it as possible. The report includes a transcript of much of the class interaction and the author's interpretations. A final section discusses student reaction to the lesson and to their additional task of designing and teaching  an original social studies discovery lesson in a local public school. Student attitudes toward discovery teaching were mostly negative after the author's lesson and did not change after their own teaching experience. The author notes, however, that many of those students who disapproved of discovery asked for the author's lesson for use in their own student teaching during the following semester. (Author/DJB)",

Development of the COD objectives involved five years of preparation. The difficulties of defining terms, determining the scope of the objectives, phrasing the statements of objectives, and the methods of research undertaken by each contractor are described in the report. The final version of the objectives was accepted by National Assessment in July of 1970. COD is unique in that the objectives of the area are not the educational goals of any one school subject; they do  not belong to a single discipline. The area includes many of the general achievements that result from general education and from guidance and counseling. The five major objectives are: 1) to prepare for making career decisions; 2) to improve career and occupational capabilities; 3) to possess skills that are generally useful in the world of work; 4) to practice effective work habits; and, 5) to have positive attitudes about work. The major objectives are followed by subobjectives and further defined in terms of those objectives which should be attained by age 9, age 13, age 17, and (young) adult. The objectives will serve as the basis of exercises that will be administered at four age levels in 1972-73.

To emphasize the unity and the diversity of Latin American this bibliography is divided into two sections: one dealing with aspects of Latin America as a whole, and the second covering individual countries or geographical areas. Part one, arranged by subject, deals with general works, geography, history, culture, literature, ideas, economics, politics, hemisphere relations, sociology, and the dynamics  of social change. Part two, arranged by geographic area, covers the countries from Mexico and the Caribbean southward to Chile and Argentina.

The first three chapters provide background discussion on the problems of teaching and testing these skills and offer some general suggestions. A chapter follows giving suggestions on the use of the bulletin. Here, teachers are urged to use the exercises and suggestions as a starting point in directing the learning and development of more efficient study skills rather than as an end point to measure the relative mastery of particular skills or abilities. The exercises are not intended to be used as a final examination, but rather to stimulate pupils to further learning tin the  field of endeavor from which the items are drawn. The remainder of the bulletin is devoted to the actual selection of test items. It includes exercises on: acquiring information; reading and interpreting graphs, charts, and tables; identifying the central issues; distinguishing between fact and opinion, between fact and motive, open-mindedness recognizing biased statements; drawing inferences, recognizing statements which support generalizations; and, determining the relative significance of questions.

        "description":"The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between political education and social studies curriculum and the political orientations of students in the United States, Italy, Sweden, Germany, and England. A review of psychological research indicates that conventional, or comformist moral and legal orientations develop early in life, are universally modal, and typically persist. Traditional schooling does not attempt to facilitate development of a more autonomous orientation. Three dimensions of political orientation are presented as being parallel to moral and legal orientations and their developmental stages: efficacy, legitamacy, and dissent. The study is based on 1968-69 test results of an average of 355 9-20 year old students in each country. Exposure to formal  political education and social studies subjects are the independent variables. It is tentatively concluded that the courses, in general, have a meager effect on political orientation. And, the course content is redundant because it does not present the student with stimuli sufficiently different from what he has received earlier in life. (Author/DJB)",

To make a rational decision, the social actor must use concepts, generalizations and theories from the social sciences, knowledge which has high predictive value, and knowledge which constitutes the structures of the social science disciplines. He must also identify, form and clarify his values, as well as consider alternative values and their consequences. When a social actor acts intelligently to influence public policy, he has mastered knowledge related to the issue, clarified his values regarding it, and is acutely aware of the possible consequences of his actions and is willing to accept them. Action which does not satisfy these criteria is irrational. Thus, to keep our highly divided society from  destructive polarization and total dehumaniziation, we must train students to act rationally to shape public policy. Since the school is a social institution with problems which mirror those of the larger society, students can be provided much practice in shaping public policy by working to eliminate problems in their classroom, school or school system.

        "author":["Patrick, John J."],
        "description":"Democracy entails the concept of orderly liberty, a concept that implies both obedience and constructive skepticism. Since teaching youngsters to be democratic citizens is a central concern of civic education, we must be concerned about whether our youth acquire this concept of orderly liberty. Studies indicate that American youth tend to value law and order, however, they tend to be unable to indicate a profound knowledge of the functions of law. The beliefs of American youth about the functions of law vary with age. In the 10-14 year age group, they stress the negative, coercive function of law and the value of single-minded obedience to law. Older youth, the 14-18 year age group hold more complex beliefs and are more likely to think critically about particular laws and  authorities. However, they still display tendencies toward intolerance of particular types of dissent. These findings raise important questions about instructional priorities. How can civic educators more effectively: 1) teach students that civil liberties are necessary to a democratic approach to law and order; 2) teach students that equality before the law is necessary to justice; 3) design instruction which helps students to acquire more profound knowledge about law and order and human rights; and 4) tak e advantage of the age when the greatest increase in political learning and ability to deal in abstractions takes place, 11-13?

People living in a rapidly changing society have many expectations for education, among which are the teaching of moral and ethical values, basic skills, affective objectives, the existence of a force for social action, and relevance and accountability. One problem in achieving excellence is that diverse groups fail to communicate properly and do not become effectively involved in setting goals for quality in education. Excellence in education occurs when quality becomes a primary goal; when flexible attitudes prevail toward procedures in schools and school systems; when high  standards are observed in the home, school and community; when priorities permit resources to support excellence; when the learning needs of all are included; and, when continuous, cooperative, comprehensive long range planning is implemented. Public education is the responsibility of each state, which must provide the needed leadership through a state coordinating agency. The local educational board must accept responsibility for improving schools. In all cases, wide involvement of lay, professional, and governmental elements of society is necessary.

The questionnaire sought information regarding: 1) specific state laws dealing with the conduct of field trips by teachers with groups of children; 2) recent and earlier court decisions regarding teacher responsibility and liability; and, 3)  comments regarding the issue in general. Responses are tabulated, summarized, and quoted in four tables and interpreted as follows: 1) relevant state laws and court decisions are few, if any, in number; 2) the teacher conducting a field trip is no more liable to tort liability for negligence than he would be in his own classroom; and , 3) liability insurance is available to teachers either through government agencies and/or member ship in professional organizations in many states.

It attempts to provide some solutions to questions about what to teach, how to teach it, and, of course, where to find materials. Both disciplines and topics appropriate to social studies courses are represented by books of fiction and nonfiction, articles, films, simulations, and case studies. The first of three sections is comprised of entries on the nature and causes of war, from the perspectives of history, anthropology, psychology, weaponry, nationalism, conflict, aggression, violence, and international system, and population growth. A second section, War Prevention: Approaches and Techniques contains items on such topics as U.S. foreign policy; arms control  and disarmament; ethics, religion, and war; world order; futurism; and nonviolence. Each item is coded as appropriate for the average, above average, or superior student, and/or for the teacher. Most entries include price and availability information. The third and last section lists resource organizations in the war/peace field. Addresses and brief descriptions of activities and services are provided. (JLB)",

Oral history is defined as primary source material in the form of tape and/or transcript resulting from recorded interviews with persons deemed likely to harbor recollections of interest to scholars. The topical range of the 230 indexed collections is wide, including terms of interest to the political scientist, art historian, medical scholar, student of the civil rights movement, musicologist, labor expert, economist, science writer, urbanist, and many others. In public affairs the range runs from country courthouses to Presidential administrations. Archives of recorded sound,  collections which consist primarily of speeches, folk music, radio interviews, and the like, are not considered within the scope of oral history. Collection entries include institution address, major topic, memoirs of note, purpose, age and funding of the project, and extent of holdings. Lists of institutional collections intended for internal use and other institutions planning collections are appended. (Author/DJB)",

        "description":"I intend to identify some of the important propositions which issue from fourteen empirical studies on political socialization, and to point to implications for schools and especially civic education programs. I define political socialization as the process of acquiring and changing the culture of one's own political environment. Among the propositions are: 1) statements of goals on citizenship objectives for schools are not consistent with social and political realities; 2) the major influence that the school has is to reinforce notions of allegiance and responsibility to the government; 3) schools do not provide political skills needed to participate effectively in political life; 4) the impact of the civics curriculum on political socialization is appreciable when social  issues are focal and when they are discussed in the spirit of inquiry. (The paper discusses additional propositions.) Several needed changes emerge: 1) participation in decision making by faculty and students needs to be promoted at the levels of school governance and in formal instruction; 2) pressing social issues need to be dealt with explicitly and honestly; 3) programs in civics and history need to be drastically revamped to stress the skills of inquiry.

        "description":"The Meiji Restoration of 1868 ended six centuries of feudal military rule by establishing a divine Emperor and clam oligarchy. Compulsory schooling and military service soon followed. Until WWII both institutions engaged in moral training that was both Confucian and nationalistic in its emphasis on absolute loyalty to the state and Emperor. The ethical instruction in the school was taught in required &quot;shuushin&quot; courses. By the 1930's a new dimension was added to these courses: the suitability of Japan's national character for less well-endowed races. Military personnel received spiritual training in every facet of their preparation for Japan's defense and cosmopolitan destiny; their social role included modeling of the Japanese character. Post WWII schooling and military  organization and training are markedly different. External intervention and national re-evaluation have resulted in democratic educational objectives and practices. Although constitutionally demilitarized in 1947, the military was re-established between 1950 and 1954. It is relatively small in size and budget, civilian controlled, staffed by volunteers, and is limited by statute and public opinion to a self-defense role. In conclusion, the dominant values of Japanese society, the mission and capabilities of the military forces, and the relationships between the armed forces and society today bear little surface resemblance to prewar Japan.

These systems include the university system, the field of education as a system, and the societal system in general. The first part of the model is an input-structure-output matrix; the second is a similar matrix which focuses on goals and evaluation methods and criteria. The second matrix is designed to facilitate examination of the systems in question according to certain criteria for a type of intersystemic relationship call \"synergy.\" Synergy is considered a desirable phenomenon since it results from similar subsystems functioning so closely that the total effect is greater  than sum of the subsystem effects. Sample data is provided for each matrix based on a study of the literature. It is suggested that the model would be most useful in specific research performed within a given region or national subsystem. (RT)",

Although a comprehensive evaluation should include all professional personnel, the emphasis is on beginning teachers (those in their initial year in the system) and those who, according to the principal, clearly need assistance. The procedural steps are discussed under the following headings: orientation, initial assessment, teachers in continuing service, possible exemption from interim evaluation, coordination and continued supervision, and interim evaluation. Eight assumptions are listed 1) educational goals should be expressed in student-behavior terms, 2) objectives should be established in the affective domain, 3) the psychomotor domain should  be given attention at the early childhood levels, 4) the teacher's behavior is modified to involve the learners in setting objectives and determining levels of participation, 5) the approach to student evaluation is behavioral, 6) the teacher must be evaluated in behavioral terms, 7) the supervisor must be aware of the behavioral modifications expected, and 8) teachers should be freed from guilt feelings concerning their performance. The evaluation instruments and forms used in evaluating individual teacher tasks are included. (MBM)",

The changed societal and professional needs of teachers must be realized. A course for creativity was proposed for senior graduate students in the Department of Education of a State University College. The procedure was a study gathering information from many relevant sources to either reject or establish a need for such a course. The sources were: 1) organization of a course outline, 2) survey of local faculty thinking, 3) writing to researchers and teachers in this area, 4) administration of need assessment questionnaire to classroom teachers in schools, and 6) results of inservice creativity workshops.  Analysis of evidence overwhelmingly established the need for such a course. It is suggested that the above six steps can be used as procedures for assessment of need for a course. (JLF)",

Some rationales for role prediction studies are considered. The reports researched indicate that relatively little interest has been shown in the teacher's role within an individualized system. The predictions and expectations identified are summarized to make possible an empirical check against six studies which use direct observations of teacher activities in the classroom as a source of data collection. There are reasonable grounds for predicting an extended use of  individualized instruction aided by educational technology, and it therefore seems advisable to introduce student teachers into the fundamentals of this type of instruction. Other predictions are that the teacher will spend more of his time interacting with individual students and small groups and that team arrangements for common planning and execution of instruction will become more widespread. Empirical evaluation which is a basic feature of educational technology should include continuous checks on the teacher role so that modifications can be made in the system arrangements and appropriate teacher training programs can be designed.

This investigation set out to examine selected aspects of teacher education programs as a basis for establishing the future direction of the total teacher education program of the Department of Curriculum and Instruction. The problems investigated were 1) What is the nature of the components of the program, 2) What is the perceived value of selected subcomponents, and 3) What is the nature of the students. The general design was to obtain data concerning programs through instructor interviews and logs, student questionnaires and interviews, and cooperating teacher questionnaires, and student data through questionnaires,  examinations, and other instruments. The results for programs are examined in detail in four sections: description by instructors, by present students, by graduated students, and by cooperating teachers, followed by details of the results concerning students. Many conclusions and implications resulted from the study, but the overall conclusion is that although the programs appear to prepare technically competent teachers for existing schools, they do not have a vigorous urban thrust, a future orientation emphasis, or a strong experimental posture.

The second part of the paper describes the portal schools in operation at the University of Georgia as of July 1, 1971. Twelve schools have been set up, each with a university faculty member to serve as center coordinator. Each student spends four quarters in these schools, one each  at sophomore and junior level and two at senior level. In the first quarter the assignments are generally non-instructional in the public school classroom and involve assisting individual children on small groups in practice activities. In the second quarter students are encouraged to observe, record, and react to individual pupil behaviors, classroom interaction, and the learning climate of the classroom. In the third quarter students are given opportunities to develop a variety of classroom strategies, and in the fourth they work as student teachers under the supervision of a master teacher and the university coordinator.

Each is focused on the problem of determining the likely demand for overseas personnel for staffing secondary level institutions through 1975, and each attempts to analyze the problem of teacher supply within the context of the social and economic conditions of the country. The experience in Kenya is unique in several respects and is particularly influenced by the rapid development of self-help or harambee schools which have led to the very rapid growth of the educational system in the past decade. The staffing needs of these schools will influence the need for further expatriate assistance. Another unique feature is the recognition  through newly-approved salary scales of the specialized nature of the task of the teacher educator, and a third is the high priority which the government has given to the staffing of all secondary level institutions. Other topics examined include the projected expansion of other types of secondary level education, programs for the preparation of teachers, major factors in their recruitment and retention, projected gaps in the teaching force, priorities in the provision and use of expatriate teachers, and recommendations of primary concern to Kenyan authorities.

The McCollum-Davis Model is designed to develop understanding of and skill in relating a structure of learning process to a structure of knowledge. It consists of the teaching model, relationship of process to knowledge, and teaching mode. The Duvall Model is intended for teachers or administrators who take the training so that they can teach others and for teachers who wish to apply the higher level thinking ability strategies in their classrooms. There are no specific prerequisites for program participants in either model. The  rationale for the evaluation design is explained and the efficiency and effectiveness criteria are discussed. Data collection instruments and methods are described for measuring both workshop and program effectiveness, and results are examined which indicate workshop efficiency and program effectiveness, with details of the various systems used in analyzing the data. Results indicated that individual application of the thinking tasks of concept formation, interpretation of data, and application was more successful than the use of all three in concert.

Each abstract contains a description of the subject matter, the time period covered, the objectives, the evaluation strategy used, results, conclusions, and recommendations, as well as data on the number of people and schools involved and the approximate cost. Results in the elementary schools indicated that the significant reading and arithmetic gains  made in the first year of the program were not easy to duplicate in the second year because of the high achievement base established during the previous year, but results in some schools showed that gains can be achieved by a concentration of resources averaging $300 per pupil over the resources used in the regular program. Parent involvement and activities in intergroup relations and staff development had a supportive effect throughout the year. Junior high school pupils consistenly exceeded their previous year's gains and uniformly surpassed their non-ESEA school mates. Notable increases in the number of staff conferences with pupils and parents and with other staff members were reported. (MBM)",

The rationale for Phase III was to see if the model could be successfully transferred to an area other than teaching teachers to teach elementary science, and so permit acceptance of the hypothesis that the IN-STEP approach was successful. A vehicle for field testing the model was developed during Phase III, through a course in Management of Instructional Systems, and the model was then implemented to teach this course. Approximately 85 teachers in Palm Beach County took part in this field test. Instruction was individulized to a much greater extent  by pre-assessing participants. Results showed that approximately 93 percent of the participants in Phase III developed an instructional system of their own, 100 percent completed at least one of the modules with a mastery of its content, and approximately 98 percent indicated that they had changed their behavior in the classroom and that they would implement skills, materials, and new techniques which they had acquired. The course is regarded as a vital step in teaching teachers to humanize their curricula offerings while still maintaining some structure within their program. (MBM)",

Informal evaluation was supplemented by a specially designed instrument, \"In-service Inventory\" (also included), which measured teacher attitude towards the Triple I Project and other in-service  projects. While the Triple I Project was considered a success, one of the most significant findings was that teacher attitude appeared to be the greatest determinant of success or failure of this project, as judged from the teacher's own perception.

Research and development tasks which would be likely to increase the feasibility of each model were identified. Analysis indicated  that most of the program specifications are fairly conservative. Several models had incomplete or weak conceptions of the teacher with consequent lack of program focus and questionable program power. Some programs had exceptionally strong elements which could be used to improve others, for example simulation laboratories, systems for integrating program elements, and ways of ensuring program integrity. The most powerful common element is the management technology which permits individualization, integration of program support systems with instructional systems, and continuous program redevelopment and monitoring.

        "description":"The author contends that the openness of a program can be determined by the opportunities which are provided for certain behaviors, activities, and events to occur. Even though the specific content of the open education programs may vary, the degrees of freedom for behaving or the relative presence of opportunity for diverse involvement do not. The paper describes procedures and research undertaken to measure this facet of openness by means of a program structure index and a specific version of the procedure, the Open Program Structure Index (OPSI). The concern of the general procedure is to characterize the extent to which it is possible for a specified behavior, activity, or event to occur in a program setting, and illustrations of the use of this procedure are included. In the  Open Program Structure Index, 15 specific items are used as the behavior and activity criteria, and the program is specified as it occurs on a typical day. Ratings are made for each criterion used and for each time period described. The procedure has been used to index openness in several school and early childhood programs and appears to be metrically adequate. Indications are that OPSI can be used to index a full range of programs reliably and validly, and that it is also adaptable for rating the components of a program. (MBM)",

The program focused on the special educational needs of Mexican-American and black children living in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Corps members worked with individuals or small groups of children who had language difficulties, disciplinary problems, or were slow learners. Some regular teachers adopted corps members' techniques but others believed that the innovations were not of particular benefit. Corps members were instrumental in the development and operation of learning centers which provided elementary school children with materials for  developing their knowledge of mathematics, science, and social studies, and which continued operating after the end of the program. Members also organized or participated in community activities. Eighty-two percent of the interns continued in teaching, most in areas serving low-income families. The university developed two teacher preparation programs modeled in some respects on the Teacher Corps program. The General Accounting Office believes the effectiveness of the programs could be increased by the wider dissemination of information on successful experiments and teaching techniques.

This is the first attempt to apply economic input/output methodology to compensatory education. Personnel in 42 projects in 37 California school districts were interviewed to obtain detailed data on teaching strategies, individual instruction time per pupil, intensity of instruction, patterns of coordination of project personnel, and other variables. Variables were related to pupils' monthly gain in grade equivalents via multiregression techniques, holding program length and beginning score constant. Results contradict reports that compensatory education is ineffective.  Individual instruction by trained reading specialists was consistently related to gains. Less strongly related were staff planning time and individual instruction by classroom aides. The six best projects averaged at least 1.25 months' learning per month of instruction. None were large or urban, all had small group instruction by specialists, high ratio of managers to pupils, and planning coordination. (MBM)",

The American school system has grown amazingly since 1920, when only 20 percent of 17 -year-olds attended public schools, compared with nearly 80 percent today. Nearly one third of the entire population is enrolled in public and private institutions, and there has been a striking increase in the number of black students. Educational research has also greatly increased. The need for finance reform is receiving increasing attention and new ways of financing public education are being examined. Some of the questions to be considered in developing a fair and adequate educational finance system are 1) How and  to what extent should we seek to diminish the wealth-based disparities among school districts within a state? 2) Assuming that such equalization among districts should be sought, should educational finance reform also seek to equalize expenditures among the states? 3) If intrastate equalization is desired, will local supplementation of resources be permitted? and 4) How can urban districts obtain the extra resources they need to deal with their special problems?

To do this, he has prepared a grid in which the six elements of the human condition from developmental psychology intersect with the four elements of the operational goals. The operational goals of teaching are defined as fluency, manipulation, confidence/value, and persistence. The psychological categories are intellectual, emotional, social, aesthetic, spiritual, and physical, The grid indicates that we have projected a monstrous version of the human condition by our failure to examine seriously 22 out of 24 elements that belong in  comprehensive curriculum design and evaluation. We know little about the aesthetic, spiritual, and physical aspects of growth, and current evaluation schemes tend to leave out the areas of confidence/value and persistence.

Examples are given of the treatment of teachers in New Jersey where 40 percent do not have tenure. A 1965 statement of the NEA Commission on Professional Rights and Responsibilities is quoted on the purpose of tenure in ensuring competent and efficient school systems.

The Bureau of School Studies is a consortium of public school districts, intermediate districts, and universities which is devoted  to research and services in the areas of school management. The Office of Collective Negotiations was established as an integral part of the Bureau in April 1970, and the program has developed in two phases, the first consisting primarily of an on-going progress report of collective negotiations with teacher units. Phase two included workshops for management negotiators, reports on legal aspects of negotiations, master-management contract language, and progress reports on negotiations with non-certified units and administrative units.

A 2 x 4 factorial design was employed with four levels of the lecturer's gaze at the eyes of the students (gaze, preferred gaze, excluded gaze, and no gaze). The students evaluated the lecturer and lecture and took a short test on content. Results showed that the lecturer's gaze had an effect on audience retention and on their perception of the lecturer. Experiment 2 used two levels of gaze and two levels of movement, with methodology  and dependent variables similar to the first experiment but with large groups of male students in a classroom setting. No significant differences were found in the results. Experiment 3 investigated the effects of a videotaped lecturer's gaze and most subjects, regardless of experimental condition, indicated a positive change in attitude. Experiment 4 used similar procedure to the first experiment but with more subtle manipulations and greater control of the lecturer's gaze. No significant results were found. Future research should involve experimentation in actual classrooms to explore the nonverbal behavior of effective and ineffective teachers. (MBM)",

Four instruments were administered to 121 practice teachers specializing in elementary education and to their cooperating teachers (N=69) in the fall and spring of 1970-71 academic year. The instruments were the \"Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory\"; Wrightman's \"Philosophy of Human Nature\"; Harvey's \"This I Believe\"; and a questionnaire, developed for the study, which surveyed opinions about the nature of the practice teaching environment. A separate-sample, pretest-posttest design was used; data were analyzed with analysis of variance and Chi-square  techniques. Findings indicate that the micro-team teachers and interns were more openminded as a result of their experience than were student teachers. There was no significant change in the self-concept of any of the practice teachers. Since the interns were selected on the basis of higher academic achievement and personal interviews, the findings suggest that micro-team teaching provides a superior environment.

Rhetoric is defined as the art of making choices among available means of expression. The major implication of the definition is said to be that rhetoric, as the art of selection, is primarily concerned with anticipating effects. It is suggested that all that the teacher can do honestly is to try to give students the kind of information that will help them anticipate effects and therefore choose usage intelligently. To promote understanding rather than dictation, it is suggested that writing be looked at as a flow or continuity. To understand the experience of writing, it is stated that teachers of writing should write. (DB)",

An analysis of the different words misspelled and the number of times each word was misspelled shows that most of the words were misspelled only rarely, while a comparatively few words were misspelled much more frequently. Five major groups of errors were noted: (1) misspelling of endings of words, (2) misspelling of vowels, (3) misspelling of homonyms or near homonyms, (4) misspelling of consonants,and (5) misspelling of prefixes and combining forms. An outline of the  kinds of spelling errors made in grades 9-12 is included for reference. (CK)",

This color-coded system is based on two assumptions: that color will appeal to the students and that there are three principal reasons for misspelling. Two groups were chosen for the experiments. A basic list of spelling demons was drawn up to examine whether particular rules were responsible for words on the list. A total of 116 words was color-coded. Three colors - red, green, and yellow - were used as meaningful for car-conscious high school students. Transparancies were made with five words on each transparency. Three days a week, a new transparency of five words was projected and an explanation of the five given. Two days a week previous transparencies were  used to keep a steady review in progress. Unannounced periodic tests were administered. Statistics clearly show that the color-coded method was superior to the traditional spelling-list announced-test techniques. It is concluded that the use of visual presentations, especially those connected with technology, is meaningful to present-day high school students. It is recommended that teachers of language become more sensitive to the visual stress in popular culture. (CK)",

        "description":"Language acquisition in children, ages 6 to 10 years, and their linguistic competence with respect to complex aspects of English syntax, are studied. The nature of specific disparities between adult and child grammar are discussed, and the gradual reduction of these disparities as the children's knowledge of language increases is traced. In all, 36 children are tested by means of psycholinguistic experiments for knowledge of 8 complex syntactic structures; 5 of the structures prove to be acquired in sequence, revealing 5 developmental stages in syntax acquisition. Of particular interest is the regular order of acquisition of structures, accompanied by considerable variation in rate of acquisition. The range of ages at each linguistic stage is considerable. The children's exposure  to written language as complex language inputs is examined in relation to linguistic development rate. Reading background and current reading activity are surveyed through interviews with both children and parents and through daily records of the children's reading (and listening) over a one-week period. Information is given on amount and complexity of independent reading and listening, background in children's literature, and recall and recognition of books. Lists of books read and named are included. A formula was developed and applied to 150 books and magazines reported to judge reading complexity levels. Methods are assesed, and relationships discussed. Results show a strong correlation between reading-exposure measures and language development. (Author/CK)",

The technique involved is one in which the student is shown just those meanings which he can spontaneously relate to his emotions and interests. This synthesis can be made by using the lyrics of popular songs. The student can see the images, mood and dramatic situation of the speaker-singer, sense the ironies and tensions in the statements, watch how the ending of the song grew out of beginning--become aware in other words, of all those poetic elements and functions which the beginning student might one day see brought to perfection in the great poetry of our heritage. In addition to foreshadowing in song lyrics this kind of formal significance in poetry, the teacher might ask his students to express and  bring into awareness their feelings about what the lyrics say. At the right point in the course of study, the teacher may make the transition from popular lyrics to the poetry of a poet such as E.E. Cummings or Dylan Thomas. (CK)",

        "description":"The basic scope of this document is a study of the emergence of a linguistic standard for England. It is stated that this was essentially an unconscious process, a recognition of an existing social situation, which took place during the 15th century. A differentiation is made between speech characterized as standard and that characterized as model. The former is simply a statement of fact, whereas the latter is regarded as having acquired such prestige that it is considered as essential to professional performance and to social and economic advancement. A dialect usually achieves the status of a standard before it becomes accepted as a model. This is defined as a transition from the realm of unconscious acceptance to that of conscious prescription. It is pointed out that at no  period in the development of English was the linguistic standard as absolute and monolithic as is often assumed. The Londoner, living during the reign of the first Elizabeth, had certain choices not available to his twentieth-century counterpart in the time of Elizabeth II, and vice versa. Standard English, it is emphasized, can only be understood in the perspective of its long development and the forces which shaped it. Social utility was the dominant force which shaped the standard at the outset, and the language has continued to be responsive to the demands of a constantly changing social situation. (Author/CK)",

The question is posed: What are teachers of English doing to help bring about a day when there will be no more politically motivated arson, no more riots, nor more young people shot in the streets or on the campuses? The point is made that there is scarcely a major English author in the 19th century who does not speak in some profound way to one or more 20th century problems. These problems are described as those of living in the modern world, in a rapidly growing industrial, scientific, technological, materialistic, urbanized society. It is claimed that today's most gifted writers tend to ignore these problems because they have given up on the modern world. It is further claimed that the best 19th century writers resemble the  best of our youth in their refusal to come to terms with this new age. The document is concluded with a quote from Carlyle to the effect that there are values even in a materialistic world that lead us to live purposeful and aware lives. (Author/CK)",

The main objective of these discussions was to facilitate a deeper understanding of human communication through interaction of conference participants with colleagues in other disciplines. Topics discussed included speech production, feedback, speech perception, and development of language and language skills. Five levels of discourse were dealt with--the acoustical, the neurologic, the articulatory, the psychologic or behavioral, and various model languages. A concept of the speech-production system discussed was a system that has an output of phonemes and an input of control instructions. The discussion of the concept of feedback revealed that, depending upon the level of complexity of the speech response that  was under discussion, the conference participants had a difficult time settling on how many and how extensive had to be the feedback loops that would be involved. In the consideration of speech perception, conference participants again had difficulty in reaching a decision on the definition of the stimulus for speech perception. A review is given of the schedule of development of certain kinds of speech and language behaviors. Conclusions include: (1) Speech production is a general kind of complicated motor behavior; and (2) Time-variant characteristics of speech signals are less identifiable anatomically than are spectral characteristics.

The program introduces adolescents to literary, linguistic, and rhetorical traditions and forms; it also caters to students' interests, and uses, as much as possible, contemporary materials and ideas. The program encourages student involvement in all its  aspects and emphasizes learning through all the senses so that learning is total rather than merely verbal. The program presents major units for each grade, 7-9. There are a variety of types of units in each grade, e.g., at least one unit that emphasizes a particular literary genre, one that is thematically organized, and another that emphasizes the continuity of a particular literary tradition or motif.

The first semester of the course in English literature is taught as a survey course, which is presented chronologically; thus the students' first experience with 19th century poetry is with the Romantics. It appears that there is some value in teaching some of the really bad poems of the writers of this period (Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelly, and Keats), as this seems to increase the students' empathy with the poets. One of the most effective techniques for teaching poetry is said to be that of comparison and contrast. In the course discussed, the student who develops a special interest in one or more of the poets can choose to study this poet in  depth with as little or as much guidance from the teacher as he desires. One way of accomplishing this is through the use of a long critical paper, which every senior writes, based on the reading of at least two works or authors. (DB)",

        "description":"This essay discusses the place of the nineteenth-century novel in our secondary schools. Although this paper deals essentially with British novels, much of what is said pertains to American novels also. The point is made that the place of these novels in the secondary schools has changed as previously most student in high school accepted the curriculum presented without question, whereas the reverse is true today. Three factors are given as responsible for this change in the student body: (1) Jobs formerly open to a student without a high school education are seldom available now; (2) Minimum age for terminating school is higher; and (3) More people are convinced that staying in school is the correct thing to do. Two other complicating factors in the teaching of the secondary  school English class is a reluctance on the part of the schools to change both curricula and teaching methods. It is suggested that there are three types of situations in which the nineteenth century novel could be successfully taught at the secondary level: (1) an elective course entitled, \"British Literature,\" (2) an elective course for study of the novel, and (3) an elective course entitled \"The Nineteenth Century Novel.\" (CK)",

        "description":"This article describes a project-oriented approach to teaching language awareness at the college freshman level. It is emphasized that it is important for students to realize that language is dynamic and that it changes because people change. The study of slang can make the student aware of the changeableness of a living language. Students were asked to be attentive to the use of slang terms in the university community in particular and then to fill out 3x5 data collection cards, with one card for each word or term. Once these cards were submitted, they were edited, and repetitions and obvious and non-slang terms were eliminated. A 19-page dictionary with space for redefining and a method of indicating the frequency of usage of the terms was then compiled. It was found that for  the students, the group nature of the work they were doing and the naturalness and practicality of their assignments were impressive features of the project. They understood the necessity of investigating the data that they compiled and they found themselves actually working with the dynamics of the language, its etymologies, word-formation techniques, and the mechanisms of language.

The teacher is offered one short poem, written by a fifth grade student, which can be used as an exercise in poem analysis. It is believed that the poem analyzed, \"The Ball,\" which is comprised of 11 words, is effective as an introduction to poetry at various levels; is an illustration of Joyce's notion of epiphany; and is a practical example of Coleridge's definition of a legitimate poem. Through use of such an analysis, it is believed that the student is more easily introduced to what he is looking for when he reads a poem, what kind of pleasure the poem might give him, and how he can compound that pleasure.

The recommended procedure is centered around T-unit analysis. The following sequence is one possible way the T-unit analysis procedure might be used by an elementary school teacher: (1) Divide all the sentences of a pupil's composition into T-units; (2) Divide the total number of words in the composition by the total number of T-units, which will reveal the average length of the pupil's T units; (3) Analyze each sentence in the composition in terms of the number of T-units, number of words per T-unit, ways in which subordination and coordination are indicated, means for the development of characterization, nominals, adverbials and any other measures  which affect T-unit length; (4) Prepare a summary outline based on the analysis of sentences including T-unit measures, features of the pupil's syntax, methods utilized for developing characterizations, plot structure analysis, and story interpretation; and (5) Write an evaluation based on the data obtained in steps 1 to 4. This method is illustrated with dictated oral compositions of two grade 1 students. The chief benefit of this procedure is the insights it gives the teacher as to the syntactic performance of his pupils. (Author/DB)",

A respondent group was selected from University faculty families to complete a questionnaire based upon the Eisner Art Attitude Inventory. Five hypotheses were tested: (1) A significant positive correlation exists between parents and their children's attitudes toward the fine arts; (2) The older children's attitudes will have a lower correlation with their parents' attitudes than the younger children; The parents in the physical science category are more conservative in their art attitudes than those in the social sciences; (4) Mothers' and daughters' attitudes will be more liberal than those of fathers and sons; and (5) Children's attitudes will be more liberal than those of their parents.  The following areas were included in the questionnaire: satisfaction and voluntary activity in art, self estimate of ability in art, and attitude toward art and artists. The t test was used to determine significance of correlations. Findings include: (1) Parents and children correlated insignificantly at all levels; (2) The age level of children does not significantly affect correlations; (3) More liberal art attitudes exist among professors and their families in the social sciences; (4) Mothers and daughters had more favorable art attitudes than fathers and sons; and (5) Parents in the social sciences had more favorable attitudes than their children, but children in the physical sciences had more favorable attitudes than their parents.

The objective frequency of the first stimulus considered in the SME task is not related to a subject's overall accuracy in predicting objective frequency, but accuracy is related to the subject's tendency to perceive frequency ratios as relatively large. Subjective estimates measure something slightly different from what is indexed by currently available objective counts, and may be more valid measures of true  word probability. (Author/CK)",

        "description":"The preliminary plan for the proposed National Institute of Education (NIE) is outlined. The author discusses a conflict of interests and pressure between Congress and the educational community which seriously hampered confidence in the Office of Education's R&amp;D program, and suggests that the NIE, to avoid this problem, must establish priorities to deal with multiple demands and policy to deal with conflicting ones. Because the pluralistic nature of educational goals will keep the Institute's efforts in the political limelight, the author recommends that the NIE should respond to Congressional concerns about education, but that it should not react to every political whim. Finally, the pluralism of theory and methodology, of conception and approach, in the independent research  community and academia is discussed. The author feels that the NIE must seek a middle ground with an R&amp;Dprogram that is &quot;targeted&quot; in its delineation of problem areas but not so &quot;directed&quot; that it impedes prospective contractors in their development of innovative and adaptive approaches to problems.

Two operative scoring systems are described. The first employs a \"dictionary\" of 4366 weignted response words to yield 25 scores from a 90-item OWSC form. The second system utilizes a complex word-root data reduction procedure and a bank of 892 generic roots to produce scores for 40 variables.

        "description":"Dichotomous poverty is defined by taking an arbitrary standard of consumption capability as a dividing line between rich and poor. An investigation into dichotomous poverty below the 2000 dollar level will be worthwhile, since, in 1953, the Planning Board announced as a goal the attempt to lift all families above this margin. In 1953, 78 percent of the families had an income below the 2000 dollar dichotomous poverty threshold. Forty-six percent did not reach it in 1963, and 39 percent did not reach it in 1969. The reduction in the percentage of dichotomous poor from 1963 to 1969 was not sufficient to keep up with the population. Between 1963 and 1969, population grew faster than economic progress. Continuous poverty classifies as poor those who fall in a specified bottom  percentage of the population in terms of capability to consume. In terms of the distribution of income, the greater the inequality, the greater the amount of continuous poverty. While between 1953 and 1963 the poor earned more, the rest of the society earned even more than proportionately more. Agricultural workers, slum dwellers, families with unemployed or subemployed heads, and recipients of welfare are the groups who have progressed at the lowest rates--the lowest groups have progressed at the slowest rate.

        "description":"A primary reason for increased government involvement in health care delivery resides in the acknowledged difficulty of the poor in obtaining adequate care. However, in the absence of knowledge about how health, health care, socio-economic status, race, ethnicity, and geographic location are related, policies aimed at implementing right to health care concepts threaten to squander resources without achieving any benefit for the poor. The approach taken here revolves around the specification of a model relating the health status of a population to its demand for care, and the various ways in which this demand can be satisfied or left unsatisfied. With the aid of the model, an attempt is made to differentiate between the medical professional's concept of need and the economist's  concept of demand. This leads to examining the variables influencing the decisions of individuals to seek care, to accept care, and to follow through with care as well as the efficacy of care. Several research projects bearing on these relationships have been done. These include a model relating health status to demand for health care, analyses of urban physician office distribution, the efficacy of comprehensive care, the effects of air pollution and radiation on health, and the role of paramedics in the delivery of primary care.

Ten teachers of first grade classes in inner-city schools in Indianapolis volunteered to participate. Five teachers agreed to continue using a modification of the programs advocated by the authors of the basal series they were currently using. Five teachers volunteered to use the language experience approach. An observation scale was used to guide the monthly observation of each teacher. A log sheet was developed and completed by each teacher in order to control the reading time variable. The Otis-Lennon Mental Abilities Test was administered in January 1970. An adaptation of the  Primary Pupil Reading Attitude Inventory was administered in March 1970, in order to assess attitude differences. In May 1970, the California Reading Test was administered. The results of all statistical analyses suggest that there were no significant differences in attitude toward reading between the two groups. The results of this study corroborate those of the majority of the First Grade Studies, in which the language experience approach was not found to be significantly superior in terms of reading achievement.

The team identified four goals for its work in the Dearborn annex: (1) improving the physical appearance of the Dearborn school; (2) involving more parents in the school; (3) instituting a more relevant curriculum for the students; and, (4) improving the morale of the school staff and the students. The team decided that the creation of a resource room which would totally involve the school, its students and teachers, and the community, would effectively address all four goals at once. A tutorial program was coordinated by a team member, involving the services of ten students from MIT's Black  Student Union. A project was conceived by the Elementary Science Study Program to encourage students to develop units in which science and mathematics were interrelated. A ten-week workshop was run in the Fall of 1970 for the 18 member teaching staff of the Annex, the seventh and eighth grades of the Dearborn School. The workshop introduced various reading methods and ways of relating these to the different subject areas and assisted teachers in developing curriculum materials. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"After a school district is desegregated, what factors determine whether the individual school becomes a harmonious entity with full acceptance of both races, or simply another resegregated school where blacks and whites coexist uneasily? This study attempts to demonstrate that in a school's alteration from segregation to desegregation, the administrative position most centrally involved in the institionalization of this social change is its chief administrative officer--the public school principal. From an exploratory pilot study of 17 principals and assistant principals conducted in York County, Va., in the spring and summer of 1969, a questionnaire was developed to probe three dimensions of the principal's role in desegregation. During the winter of 1970, a statewide  questionnaire survey of all principals of Virginia high schools, junior highs, and combined schools was conducted. Of the 481 questionnaires mailed, 312 were returned in a manner acceptable for survey data. Findings are grouped in three areas: the principal's influence in the community, the principal as change agent in the school, and the principal's power status in the school system. These findings lead to the conclusion that desegregation is redefining the role of the principal. (Author/JM)",

This project began at a time when these institutions, as with all predominately Negro colleges, were being pushed into a state of change by demands from students, some faculty members, and some leaders outside the institutions. The two major demands were (1) the introduction of  new and extensive black studies programs, and (2) the development of curriculums more relevant to the communities surrounding the colleges and to the Negro community in general. This consortium gave to some faculty members the means to deal with these demands in a rational and academic manner by doing research on the problems and suggesting the direction of change. At least 14 of the research projects conducted under the consertium were related to the demands for change.

        "description":"The Street Academy is a program designed to meet the dropout as an individual--to assist, help and support him continually in his daily life. The academies operate from store-fronts located in neighborhoods where there are large concentrations of school dropouts. They are staffed, at the minimum, by a project director, a street worker, and a full-time teacher. Other street workers establish and maintain relationships with youth on street corners and other hangouts. The stated objectives of the program are: (1) establishing rapport with youth who drop out of Benjamin Franklin High School, as well as with those currently in school there but experiencing problems of adjustment and learning; (2) diagnosing and remedying the educational and related deficiencies of those referred, and  helping them to return to school or to continue their education in other ways; (3) helping these students to build leadership qualities, and to raise their aspiration levels so they can become more effective in meeting life's problems in the community; and, (4) providing improved teaching techniques, curriculum, and enriched educational services, in addition to a host of other services crucial to survival in the ghetto. Institutional change in the high school and in the central administration was also a broad goal. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Five major themes mark the development of public education in New York City from its early nineteenth century beginning to the mid-twentieth century: (1) the effort to provide free education for all children through the twelfth grade; (2) the development of special schools and programs for gifted youth; (3) the development of programs for children with special difficulties; (4) the elaboration of a highly standardized grade structure, curriculum, and procedures for the mass of children; and, (5) a contrasting theme of experimentation and innovation. A strong impetus to innovation came in the mid-1960's with the passage of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which brought 60 to 85 million dollars a year for four years in to the system targeted explicitly for innovative  programs in schools in poverty areas. Although the rate of success was not high, Federal aid did trigger a search for alternatives to the traditional school and stimulated the development of bi-lingual education in a number of schools, the introduction of the Open Door approach, and revised methods for teaching reading and mathematics in the elementary schools. Decentralization offers the potential for improvement in schools through the involvement of local residents as teacher aides and the effort to modify curriculum to fit the needs of the particular student body.

In the &quot;Rooms of 20&quot; program, elementary school students attend school in ungraded classrooms of no more than 20 students. One teacher works with each class, and students and teachers concentrate on reading, language, and arithmetic. The Remedial Teachers program serves Title I students having the most severe reading problems. The Work-Study High School program provides an opportunity for vocational training and work experience to students who are otherwise prone to drop out of school altogether. Lincoln Opportunity High School is for students suspended from their regular high school for behavior which disrupted regular classroom  proceedings, or their inability to succeed academically because of inadequate learning skills or motivation. The Mini-Grant component provides small grants to individual Title I schools to aid faculties in solving their instructional problems and to provide demonstrations for other schools with similar problems. Two distinct inservice training programs were conducted under the Title I inservice component. One was a massive program of workshops called Springboard, while the other consisted of three district wide and six school level programs. (Author/JM)",

It offers three types of services: information services, materials preparation services, and circulation of audiovisual media. The purpose of this evaluation is to: (a) examine the existing services offered by the Stevenson Curriculum Laboratory to Title I, E.S.E.A. schools in the Detroit Public School System; and, (b) examine the effectiveness of the laboratory in providing services to the teacher and administrator by providing those media and materials which are either too specialized  or too costly to be widely available in individual buildings. To obtain the necessary data for drawing conclusions relative to the evaluation of the Project, two survey instruments were administered: one to 200 teachers, student teachers, and paraprofessionals, and the other to 60 regional administrators, principals, and assistant principals. The emphasis of the evaluation is upon an assessment by the participants of the various aspects of their curriculum laboratory use and training. (Author/JM)",

Its primary function is to coordinate in a school setting educational, psychological, health, and social services for girls under 16 years of age who are pregnant. The project endeavors, whenever possible, to include girls over 16 who wish to continue their education. This is a ten- month project with eight weeks summer school session. Girls were carefully  selected for admission, so that those given this opportunity were the ones judged most likely to take advantage of the program. During the school year ending August 1971, 233 girls were enrolled in the program. The center accomodates about 110 girls at one time at maximum. Fourteen percent completed their graduation requirements while in the project and received high school diplomas, while 56 percent left the program planning to return to regular school. Fourteen percent dropped from the program. (Author/JM)",

While the services provided by the volunteers may on occasion include non-instruction related duties, the principal role performed by the volunteer is that of a tutor. Thus, the purpose of the program is to provide additional instructional assistance, for students performing far below normal in basic academic skills, in the form of volunteer tutors. The goal of the program as well as of the individual tutor is to help the tutorial students increase their academic achievement levels. Its attainment is supported by the testimoni- als of the volunteers, but not by test score data. However, since pretest data  were not available, a true assessment of the program's effectiveness in this area was precluded. Assessment of the program's effectiveness in achieving secondary level objectives, i.e., decreasing the amount of absence and tardiness on the part of the enrolled students and improving the relationships of these students with fellow students and significant adults, was limited solely to evidence reported by the volunteers in the questionnaires they completed.

The evaluation design focuses on three sources of information: (1) student activities, including tutorial services; (2) student scores from the Title I testing program of May 1971; and, (3) parent activities. Only about half of the agents were successful in providing information on their effects relating to activities and services provided the students and the  students' parents in the target groups. The changes in achievement level of the target group students could not be assessed because of the lack of pre- and posttest scores, at the elementary level. Almost two-thirds of the parents of Target Group students participated in one or more activities. Over three-fourths of the students, in 18 schools, participated in one or more activities not directly a part of their classroom instruction. (Author/JM)",

This document represents an attempt to formulate some aspects of this experience in a form useful for project directors. The content of this report is based on the recorded experiences of one school district during the summer of 1970 in running remedial reading and mathematics programs. An analysis of the results of the New York State mathematics and reading tests in grades three and six and the Iowa Test of Basic Skills in grades four and five indicated that problem solving is an area of major difficulty. Conferences with classroom teachers and remedial personnel confirmed the need for attacking problem solving techniques in conjunction with reading difficulties. This  recommendation was made to the Superintendent and the Board of Education who concurred with the professional findings. The decision was made to concentrate on this problem by implementing a special pilot program during the summer which would serve as a launching platform for further district action in the fall.

In the spring term of 1966 some 22 primary schools with large numbers of immigrants were visited and long discussions held with head teachers and staff. It was then decided to collect written information from all the Authority's schools containing juniors and with more than one third of their total roll, immigrants. The 52 schools surveyed included 21 junior mixed schools, 30 junior mixed and infants' schools and one junior girls and infants' school. The sample had a higher proportion of West Indian pupils than the Authority's primary schools in general. Indians, Pakistanis, and Cypriots were represented in fairly typical proportions, but the &quot;other&quot; immigrants were under-represented. About a third of these latter groups in the  sample schools were Europeans, one-third Africans, one-fifth Guyanese and the rest from various countries. Data was obtained on year of entry to education in the United Kingdom for all immigrant pupils in the sample who were due to transfer to secondary schools in 1966. An attempt was made to see whether the data on year of entry for individual pupils show any relationship with other information about them in the &quot;leavers schedule,&quot; and especially with attainment and verbal reasoning groups in the secondary transfer profile.

An analysis of the district proposals, supplemented by field investigation, indicated that 21 of the local school districts had, in fact, provided for some degree of non-public school participation in the decentralized projects for which requests for funding had been submitted. Moreover, such participation was noted in one district in one program in which non-public school involvement had not been envisaged. The three demonstration districts made no provision for non-public school participation in their decentralized projects. In all, the 21 school districts  cited a total of 67 projects that entailed some measure of non-public school participation. There were the following types of projects: after school study centers, guidance programs, remedial reading programs, paraprofessional assistance, homework helper programs, in addition to bilingual, trip, and creative arts programs.

The two major objectives of the program were: (1) to improve the academic functioning of children in kindergarten, grade one, and grade two, with special emphasis on the removal of obstacles to learning; and, (2) to involve parents, in a meaningful way, in the education of their children. The objectives were to be achieved by the allocation of additional professional and paraprofessional personnel to those elementary schools designated as poverty area schools by the Council Against Poverty. The  kindergarten program provided for more individual instruction for each pupil. A multi-media approach was instituted. Teachers, under the direction of the school principal and the Early Childhood Supervisor, planned meetings and workshops for parents. The program in grades one and two stressed methods of teaching reading and diagnosis of reading difficulty. The paraprofessional, where assigned, was to work in a close relationship with the teacher, assisting in developing improved attitudes and skills. (Author/JM)",

The report is in five sections: (1) a definition of equal educational opportunity; (2) a description of patterns of fiscal disparities that exist among and within school districts; (3) a discussion of the reasons for these disparities, examining the role of local, State and Federal programs; (4) an analysis of recent court cases resulting in the declaring  unconstitutional systems of school finance in California and Minnesota; and, (5) suggestions for reform. The second part consists of a paper presented at the 1971 annual convention of the American Academy for the Advancement of Science based upon a study of the legal and fiscal dimensions of inequalities of educational opportunity; and, an analysis of the 1970 Census data on financial and demographic trends in the largest metropolitan areas of the nation.

This paper analyzes twelve schools, all of which in varying degrees have proved successful, and chosen because they indicate the broad range of free and directed school programs now being developed for disadvantaged children of all ages. The schools, analyzed in terms of a scale from the most directed classroom situation to the freest, include: the Amidon Elementary School; the Bereiter-Engelmann Preschool; the Institute for Developmental Studies; the Perry Preschool Project; the African Free School Program; the Montessori Program for the Disadvantaged; the English in Every Classroom Program of the W.J. Maxey Boys Training School; the Free Schools of  Prince Edward County; Harlem Prep; the CAM Academy; the Pennsylvania Advancement School; and, the First Street School. What can be usefully said about free and directed schools and the needs of the disadvantaged is not so much a matter of comparing systems of education but of pointing out what freedom and directedness mean in successful educational practice.

In general, the CADA System will broaden the range of assignment alternatives for each man and billet; expand the number of decision criteria considered; and be more responsive to changes in the personnel and operational situation. Although the CADA System design outlined in this report is, from an operational standpoint, oriented toward  application in the Pacific Fleet Enlisted Personnel Distribution Office, the basic conceptual and functional framework of the design has general application throughout the distribution and assignment system and to the Atlantic Fleet in particular.

After the course, an evaluation was made of the content-learning gain and also of the attitudinal changes in training. The programed instruction in medical interviewing was found to be as effective as two alternative instructional methods in meeting its teaching goals, and the evidence  suggested that it was more effective.

A 70  percent gain in teacher supply is shown for a 6 year period, with 1,700 persons qualified for teaching vocational agriculture in the United States in 1970. The study concludes that a goal of qualifying 1,800 persons each year is a realistic one. This study should be useful to agricultural supervisors and teachers for preparing recruitment programs.

These general objectives are based on an extensive enumeration and analysis of important pedogogical performance requirements for teachers of conventional vocational programs. Although not tested in actual program operation, the objectives have been reviewed by teacher educators, and subsequently refined. The objectives are presented for each of the 10 categories of duties or functions found to be required of teachers. Finally, the development of specific instructional objectives from the general objectives is illustrated by examples. Appendixes include a glossary of terms and a master list of  performance elements referenced to the related general objectives in the main text.

During this phase, 237 performance elements were identified through application of occupational analysis techniques, and common, mixed, and unique pedagogical performance elements were identified by a task force representing seven vocational services. An additional 30 performance elements were identified and 147 performance elements were verified through a national critical incident study, and 226 performance-oriented general objectives were developed. The conclusions of the study indicated that most pedagogical performance requirements  for teachers were common to all vocational services, and that meaningful specific objectives could not be developed without consideration for a particular institutional setting. It was recommended that core offerings be considered for a majority of the curricula to be developed and that performance-oriented general objectives be prepared as guidelines for writing specific objectives.

During this phase, some emphasis was also given to recruiting and training the center's nursery assistants, and their experiences are described in this publication. To insure close staff working relationships, all staff members are involved in the interviewing, selection, and training of new nursery assistants. Once hired, the new assistant begins a week of orientation consisting of discussions with the professional and paraprofessional staff, and observations and assistance in each of the five children's groups. Further training occurs on the  job, and both the new and established assistants are encouraged to improve themselves through formal and informal means. Some opportunities for development and improvement include: (1) casual conversations between staff, (2) planned meetings, (3) observation in other infant centers, (4) experiences in keeping written observations of the children, and (5) consultation with the pediatrician, nutritionist, social worker, and psychologist.

The 35 items on the OVI consist of three statements or phrases representing three different values. The individual is forced to select the phrase or statement most important to him in selecting a job as well as the least important. Though restricted, investigations thus far indicate that the OVI reliably measures selected affective traits that uniquely contribute to distinctions between boys and girls,  academic and vocational-technical students, and successful and unsuccessful students, and is a potentially useful guidance instrument. Measures of internal consistency, stability, and concurrent validities were utilized to establish reliability and validity of the OVI, and plans for predictive and construct validity studies have been made. Norms based on a sample of 548 ninth grade boys and 531 ninth grade girls are included, and a sample instrument and directions for administering and scoring the OVI are appended. (SB)",

It is important for Greece to promote economic progress in the different regions so as to avoid an exaggerated concentration in the already over-congested present centers and the emigration abroad of the most dynamic elements of the young generation. Also in this context, proper manpower policies will be of importance so as to promote the improvement and necessary adjustment of human resources. The following is of particular importance: (1) a reorganized Employment Service with better information about the labour  market for employers and employees, (2) vocational guidance and counseling, (3) vocational training facilities for young and adults, and (4) appropriate aids to economically desirable mobility. This would also include positive measures to promote the return and reintegration in the Greek economy of workers having acquired new skills and experiences abroad. Activities in all these fields should be part of any program for economic and technical assistance to Greece. (Author)",

Elementary school emphasis was on field trips, curriculums geared to occupational choice, and development of realistic attitudes toward work. Middle school emphasis was on curriculum dealing with occupational information and guidance, and included semi-skilled training for coveraged and dropout-prone students to enable them to obtain part-time after-school and summer jobs. Instruction at senior high school level combined on-the-job training or realistic simulated employment experience with vocational guidance and job placement services. Adults, including out-of-school youth, were taught marketable skills. The program was very successful on the elementary level as measured by pretest and  posttest measures of attitude toward work. Other levels were more difficult to evaluate at this stage, although vocational counseling was very well received at the senior level and enrollment in adult courses indicated community interest. Recommendations included: (1) greater efforts to enlist community support, (2) inservice training in vocational information for teachers, and (3) objective questionnaires to measure the influence of the program.

(2) What is the appropriate composition of post-secondary vocational-technical education curriculums? and (3) How much time should be spent in the teaching of theory compared to that devoted to practice or application of theory? It was found that an average of 5 percent of the post-secondary curriculums reviewed were composed of general education components, and 15 percent of the curriculums were made up of courses related to job skills.  Conclusions were that general and related instruction must be included along with skills instruction in post-secondary curriculums, and that a compromise is needed between programs with rigorous engineering type curriculums and those with short term job skills curriculums.

Pilot programs at both the baccalaureate and associate degree levels have been established under a training grant from the Bureau of Radiological Health. Individuals going through the 2-year program are called Nuclear Medicine Technicians and those earning a baccalaureate degree are termed Nuclear Medicine Technologists. Twelve presentations were made and discussed, followed by four workshops devoted to preassigned questions involving such problems as (1) estimating the  present and future needs for additional technologic personnel in nuclear medicine, (2) the content of the academic work in associate and baccalaureate programs, (3) methods of recruitment, and (4) future involvement of government agencies in sponsoring training programs.

Included in the guide are sections on the need for driver and traffic safety education, curriculum rationale, teaching-learning interaction, and a 107-item bibliography. The curriculum contains objectives, content and learning activities divided into these major sections: (1) Introduction, giving an overall picture of the highway transportation system, (2) On Highway Tasks, (3) Readiness Tasks, and (4) Improvement  Tasks. Human functions--identify, predict, decide, and execute--involved in performing traffic-related tasks serve as reference points throughout. Behavioral objectives emphasize student-environment interaction. Fundamental concepts are repeatedly stressed, but the material attempts to lead the student through an enquiry process which results in the student discovering these concepts for himself. (CD)",

This report deals with the nature of industrial arts in the elementary school, different approaches and requirements for implementation, and some ways of meeting and solving some of the problems. Philosophically, industrial arts helps the elementary school child build an understanding of his world. Within the dimensions of physical setting and organizational mode, effective learning takes place through interaction, exploration, experimentation, problem solving, and concrete experiences that satisfy aesthetic and utilitarian needs. Approaches include programs using the: (1) limited classroom, (2)  comprehensive classroom, (3) laboratory, (4) traveling teacher, (5) mobile laboratory, (6) central laboratory, and (7) summer school. Discussions of essential components of effective leadership, and of preservice and inservice teacher education programs are included. (GEB)",

The survey revealed that a diversity of programs were taking place on a broad base with varying degrees  of success. However, it is unclear who should properly be identified as having a behavior disorder. A review of the issues in counseling approaches suggests that the traditional approach is based upon underlying assumptions of questionable validity, and criticisms have been leveled against inappropriate use of the medical model, diagnostics, and middle-class conceptions of counseling. In terms of training needed by counselors, aides, supervisors, and administrators, several techniques based on experiences of the study group are presented. (SB)",

After the data were tabulated and the percentage time distribution had been completed, a committee for each specialty reviewed the results and agreed on those activities for which an assistant should be trained. In all five specialties the most time-consuming activity was related to the  gathering and organizing of data and information incident to history taking and physical examination. On the basis of functional job analyses, course outlines, training objectives, and goals for training physician's assistants were developed. These development activities are described in this report.

The exercises were designed so as to be independent of the students' previous knowledge of grammar. Chapter 1 examines recent studies in language and writing. The first part of chapter 2 demonstrates that normal growth in syntactic maturity can be measured in quantifiable terms. The second part of the chapter describes and suggests a rationale for sentence-combining practice. Chapter 3 discusses the design and procedures of the study. The results of the study, discussed in chapter 4, indicate that the students practicing sentence-combining achieved a significant degree of syntactic maturity, and their compositions were judged to be significantly better in  quality than those written by students who did not have such practice. The conclusions and implications of the study are discussed in chapter 5: the fact that seventh graders' writing can be improved within eight months suggests that sentence-combining practice could be a valuable contribution to a composition program. Appendixes provide sample lessons and exercises as well as composition evaluation assignments. (Author/DI)",

Results were analyzed according to three error types: extralist, intralist, and omissions. No main effect of arousal or interaction with retention interval was obtained. The extralist error analysis revealed that high-arousal words significantly facilitated performance  in a forward direction and inhibited or impaired it in a backward direction relative to the effects of the low-arousal words, which inhibited or impaired performance in a forward direction and facilitated it in a backward direction. The direction of this interaction was the same, though not significant, for the omission errors. Intralist errors were so low as to make consideration of them of dubious value. (Author/DI)",

Relating the enthymeme to the Burkean concepts of acceptance, rejection, casuistics stretching, and gang morality, the function of the enthymeme in stable periods and during periods of social upheaval is compared. A movement is viewed as a public drama--an extended rhetorical transaction occurs between competing systems of order and a mass, public audience. The essential nature of a social movement, from this perspective, is rhetorical. A movement involves the redefinition, creation, and reordering of key terms which are code words for  whole complexes of value, attitude, belief, and devotion. The author suggests that the study of social change might most appropriately be the study of changing symbol systems through rhetorical analysis. (Author/LG)",

        "description":"One hundred and ten college students, placed in 22 problem solving discussion groups, interacted for three fifty minute periods each. Three trained observers systematically recorded the interaction. Group members were classified as being task or socio-emotionally oriented and the functional leader in each group was identified by role category. Following the final discussion period each group member was instructed to write a 150 word essay dealing with the members' perceptions of what constituted the group solution to the discussion and their affective relationships with other group members. These essays were subjected to cloze procedure construction and analysis. The results tended to support the conception that groups develop a language syntax and that differential syntactical  comprehension by group members serves to elucidate their respective roles within that context. However, the experimenter's earlier contention that an analysis of a group's language will differentiate the two dimensions of leadership (task and socio-emotional) along with their respective followers remains undemonstrated.

A consensus model approach to the basic course provides for a reduction in entropy regarding objectives, activities, and progress in the classroom. Applying the theories of interpersonal communication taught in the classroom to actual classroom operation, decisions in the classroom would be based on consensus between student and instructor. Consequently, the author suggests that the basic course would provide an opportunity for sharing information and values about the broad field of communication. This approach would provide an opportunity for greater understanding of the historical, critical, experimental, and social ramifications of  communication; a potential for a deeper level of understanding between students and instructor; and a worthwhile educational experience. In line with this position, the author suggests that the subject matter of communication courses should include a wide range of communication related subjects as materials for student performance.

For research purposes, simulations can be used for increasing coherence within and among theories and for consolidating knowledge. As operational models for the study of interpersonal communication, simulations enable and facilitate the study of certain communication variables under dynamic development. The author cites the variables--commitment, concession, deterrence, threat, promise, and brinkmanship--which benefit most from investigation under dynamic development. In the classroom, simulations can be used to clarify cause-effect relationships. The direct consequence and almost instantaneous feedback characteristics of simulation techniques have great potential for  demonstrating concepts which require actual experience. The author cautions against indiscriminate use of \"packaged\" games and simulations for instructional purposes. Many of the available \"packages\" unfortunately lack any relation to theory and are for all practical purposes useless. (LG)",

They were also asked to make ratings that measured four other attitudes: the degree of the group consensus, the leader's maintenance of his status, perceptions of the leader's credibility, and the members' satisfaction with the group outcome. Results of the study show that: (1) both unopinionated and moderately opinionated leadership appear to be related to achievement of group consensus; (2) varying degrees of opinionated leadership seem to relate consistently to member impressions of the leader's credibility;  (3) the level of leader opinionatedness does not seem to relate directly to leadership maintenance or member impressions of dynamism; and (4) there seems to be no direct relationship between level of leader opinionatedness and members' satisfaction with the process.

The author examined responses from 52 schools (out of a total of 82 to whom questionnaires had been sent) on such factors as institute dates, financing, events included, staffing, and recruitment. Although 20 different events were listed as being part of at least one institute, debate was the most frequently included event. The institutes were considered self-supporting by 69 percent of the schools, while the remaining 31 percent partially subsidized the institutes. Depending on the length of the institute, most respondents charged between $26 and $75 for tuition. The author concluded that high school summer speech institutes at colleges and universities  can prove to be a valuable method for providing speech training for high school students and, at the same time, for attracting students to the institution and to the field of speech communication.

Groups of students first interacted in information-sharing discussions under varying conditions of noise and then responded to an objective test over the shared information and to a series of semantic differential scales designed to measure their subjective responses to noise. Four groups of five subjects each were assigned to each of three experimental conditions and one control condition. Measures were obtained of group task performance and of subjective perceptions of noise under conditions that included 50, 60, and 70 dBC levels. Results showed that performance on information-sharing tasks by small groups was unaffected by moderate levels of outside noise,  although there were differences in the subjects' perceptions of the noise.

        "description":"The countermovement to the women's liberation movement has been varied both in origin and organization and has been slow in making its impact. Presented in this paper is an analysis of several countermovement strategies which focus upon the issues of opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment, abortion law reform, and arguments about the nature of woman. The rhetoric of countermovement organizations such as Pussycats, Females Opposed to Equality, and Happiness of Womanhood is examined and discussed in relation to these issues. The issues of argument validity, the extent to which the rhetors of the countermovement understand and refute the arguments advanced by the movement women, identifying the dominant strategies for gaining publicity, and converting potential members to the  ideals of the countermovement are analyzed by the author. It is concluded that by attacking superficial failures of the movement, exaggerating and misinterpreting movement issues, and misunderstanding what American women want and think, the countermovement has failed to come to grips with the essence of the movement.

Twenty subjects were asked to perform two tasks, each involving four short oral responses, one of which was a lie. The responses were subjected to spectrographic analysis, and the task of the experimenter was to predict which of the four responses in each set was the lie. When minimum duration of response was used as the criterion, the lie responses were accurately identified with a high degree of reliability. The second part of the study involved twenty additional subjects, who were asked to replicate the lie identifications on the same responses simply on the basis of what they heard on a tape. They were unable to make  accurate identifications of lie responses, regardless of whether or not they were informed of the duration cue. The author views this study as an initial attempt to reveal certain interrelationships between components of the encoding process. (RN)",

Fifty-six pretested subjects classified as either anomic (14 males, 14 females) or normal (14 males, 14 females) were placed in one of two interview conditions: personal space invasion or no invasion. Half of the anomics and half of the normals were placed in each interview condition. Immediately following the individual five minute interviews, state and trait anxiety scales, written essays upon which a nonperson orientation ratio was based, and source credibility scales were completed by the interviewees. A 2x2 factorial design, with high and low anomia as one factor and personal space invasion or no  invasion as the other, was used. Analysis of the data did not result in confirmation of the major hypothesis, although several subordinate hypotheses were supported. A thorough discussion of the total results is included.

Prior to 1968 the Irish Republican Army movement faced problems of apathy among its followers and neglect by governments of both Northern Ireland and England. Leaders then decided that dramatic action was required to give the movement more necessary television exposure. In 1968, therefore, they embarked on strategies of agitation and confrontation, which attracted the attention of the media, especially when the Northern Ireland government overreacted to the situations. With their expanded visibility I.R.A. activists began to exercise some degree of sophistication in their use of the media  to exploit the government reactions and win international sympathy for their cause.

Judgments of aspirants to the presidency of the United States were specifically studied. Ten stimulus-persons, varying in sex, political affiliation, and (apparent) ideology, were selected from the set of known aspirants to the presidency as of February 1972. Seventy undergraduates at the University of Illinois at Urbana participated in the study. It was found that credibility data for the group were best represented by a three-dimensional space with factors reflecting (1) the honesty of an aspirant as a function of his political ideology, (2) the seriousness of a candidate's aspirations, and (3) the  candidate's television image. The competency of aspirants did not appear to be a factor in assessment. Four viewpoint factors were extracted from the subjects by a credibility ratings matrix, and credibility configurations were obtained for subjects loading highly on each viewpoint. The configurations for the subject clusters were found to vary in nature and number of dimensions. (Author/LG)",

The degree of interdependence between the speech education program and the college of education appears to be influenced by institution size, i.e., the smaller the institution the closer the relationship between the speech department and the college of education.

In support of the position that a far broader and more complex pattern of communication must be embraced if any contemporary theorizing about communication is to explain any meaningful portion of the communication process, the author suggests a social system approach. Under this approach the classroom is viewed as dependent upon its external environment for its existence and function and as part of an organized system of activity. This system is termed social and includes many different persons in interaction who perform many different functions interdependently and whose actions are  socially promulgated and enforced. Emphasis is placed upon teacher behavior and the faculty peer group as a determinant of teacher communication in the classroom. The author calls for the development of speech communication courses for prospective teachers which recognize the teacher as part of this social system. (LG)",

The study indicates that only in a small percentage of these districts were the effects of the phaseout sufficient to cause financial problems. Furthermore, most of these districts experienced only slight problems of short duration. The report notes that, in a study of those 45 districts most affected by phaseouts, few had severe financial problems.

        "description":"P.L. 874 and 815 have operated to help relieve the burdens imposed on public school districts. These burdens reflect the tax-exempt nature of federal property. In 54 districts examined in this regard, it was found that the payments under P.L. 874 exceeded or fell short of meeting the burden by more than 10 percent in 80 percent of the districts. The payments missed the mark by 50 percent in 30 percent of the districts. The use of minimum rates has permitted districts that have low expenditures on education and/or who receive a large share of revenue from the State to receive large bonuses under P.L. 874. Mainly for this reason, total entitlements under P.L. 874 appear to exceed those needed to just meet the burden. Local option, permitting a district to be paid at a rate per  pupil equal to that of a selected set of comparable districts, does not appear to have resulted in a close relationship between the burden and the entitlements. Local fiscal ability and effort were found definitely to be adversely affected by federal connection. Some States are entitled to offset part of the federal entitlements received by districts. Only a small number of districts are presently receiving support for school construction under P.L. 815. A related document is EA 004 833. (Author)",

If estimates are to be used as adequate cost indicators, their probabilistic nature must be recognized and they must be expressed not as absolute numbers but in terms of a number with some indication of the magnitude of the risk that that number may be expected to change by some stated amount. In order to develop this new type of estimate, a model is constructed that assigns a probability distribution to each cost component of the project and ends up with a probability distribution of the total cost of the project rather than a single answer. This bracketing of the cost provides a better in-depth look at the current knowledge of the project cost  than does the traditional estimate. (Author)",

The authors argue against considering decentralization and participative management as panaceas that will solve all the problems in a school or a district. However, they contend, these components can provide a structure that stimulates creative participation. The authors also consider decentralization and participative management to be tools that can be utilized to move the schools into the \"seventies and the  eighties\"; tools that can be used to bridge the gap between teachers and management, between management and the board, and between the board and the people. In short, the writers feel that these are tools that can be used effectively to build accountability into education. (Author)",

        "description":"This project, using the previous year's experience in identifying and classifying course-level goals as desired student learning outcomes, developed course goals in six more subject matter areas. Under the supervision of tricounty curriculum and evaluation specialists, 68 highly qualified teachers wrote course goals for art, health education, mathematics, music, physical education, and social science. Teachers in career education coded the course goals to career education program goals. The computer storage and retrieval system was programmed and the key-word dictionary for language arts goals is being prepared for a field test of the program. Conferences and workshops throughout the Portland Metropolitan area provided information and assistance to teachers in using course goals  as tools for classroom instruction. A major effort in the project was to identify the type and level of learning required for the achievement of each goal. Prototype measurement items are being developed to assess each type of goal. Success in the project has encouraged its continuation to complete the storage and retrieval system, to develop items to measure achievement of goals at the course level, and to disseminate them and facilitate their use for goal definition, curriculum planning and development, instruction, evaluation, and accountability.

Should this proposal, or some modification of it, be adopted by a school district, a detailed accounting system can be designed that meets its own needs, with the assurance that (except for unforeseen future requirements mandated by the Congress) this system will also meet the needs of the  Office of Education. Since the financial information needs of school districts differ, no attempt has been made to present an overall, unified financial accounting system applicable to all school districts. (Author/DN)",

        "description":"In this landmark educational finance opinion (presented here in full) the U.S. Supreme Court held that the Texas case was not a proper case in which to examine a State's laws under standards of strict judicial scrutiny. That test, according to the Court, is reserved for cases involving laws that operate to the disadvantage of suspect classes or interfere with the exercise of fundamental rights and liberties explicitly or implicitly protected by the Constitution. In particular, the Court held that (1) the Texas system does not discriminate against any definable class of &quot;poor&quot; people or occasion discrimination based on the relative wealth of families in a district; (2) although education is one of the most important services performed by the State, it is not within the limited  category of rights recognized by the Court as guaranteed by the Constitution; and (3) this was an inappropriate case in which to invoke strict scrutiny since it involved the most delicate and difficult questions of local taxation, fiscal planning, educational policy, and federalism. The Court concluded that, although concededly imperfect, the system bears a rational relationship to a legitimate State purpose and is not, therefore, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.

        "description":"The followup study reported here is a supplement to the process evaluation of the 1971-72 multiunit school organization/individually guided education (MUSE/IGE) nationwide installation effort by the Wisconsin Research and Development Center. The major purpose of the followup study was to determine basic implementation status in a number of schools -- at about the midpoint of the second year of the overall installation program -- using selected criteria related to both MUSE and IGE programing. In all, 98 schools were chosen for the followup phase, including (a) the sample of 68 which had been selected for detailed reporting in Spring 1972, (b) 13 schools which had reported initiating MUSE/IGE in late Spring 1972, and (c) 17 schools which had indicated plans for 1972-73  installation. Evidence shows that the MUSE/IGE organizational and instructional changes have taken hold in the majority of schools responding to the followup. Apparently attrition has been slight if existent at all, and many schools have come closer to institutionalizing the two areas of innovation. Related documents are ED 066 623 and ED 066 624.

        "description":"The purpose of this theoretical paper is to describe a set of models for the instructional organization of the multiunit secondary school. The school's instructional organization is viewed as a mechanism for structuring resources to influence learning outcomes. The multiunit elementary school (MUS-E) models served as the point of departure for extending individually guided education (IGE) to the secondary levels. The major variables that influenced the design of the IGE/multiunit secondary school (MUS-S) were characteristics of the individual learner, insights into human abilities and learning, and the structure of the learning environment. A &quot;multiunit component crosswalk&quot; was created to identify MUS-E components (such as nongrading, staff hierarchies, and continuous progress)  that could be applied to middle and senior high school levels. A modular instructional organization was generated for the IGE/MUS-S. The basic components were the &quot;Individually Guided Inter-Disciplinary&quot; Module, which includes all required experiences, and the &quot;Enrichment&quot; Module, which includes all elective experiences. Each module was comprised of a learner unit, instructional unit, curriculum unit, and decision unit. Variations of IGE/MUS-S models were developed for junior high, middle, and senior high schools of various sizes. (Author/DN)",

        "description":"This report summarizes the conclusions and insights of several hundred people who have been directly involved in the 45-15 Plan for its first two years of operation. The 45-15 Plan divides the neighborhood served by a school into four sections. Each section attends 45 school days and then takes a vacation, 15 days long. The attendance dates of the four sections are staggered so that only three-fourths of the pupils are in school at any one time. This report begins by describing how the 45-15 Plan originated and how the evaluation design was prepared. The major data collected for the evaluation included student achievement, student attitudes, community reactions, reactions of professionals, and internal administrative adjustments. Attitudes were surveyed by questionnaires and  interviews. Standardized achievement tests, administered by trained testers, were used with students. The report includes conclusions and recommendations coming from the evaluation. The appendixes include samples of the forms used for evaluation and a suggested plan of action for school districts embarking on a 45-15 Plan.

Major types of data requests by the Bureau of Education for the Handicapped are briefly considered in the third chapter.  The final chapter on educational trends suggests that the emphasis on planning and evaluation has arisen out of research such as the J.S.

Teachers observations and peer evaluation are also thought to be useful means of identifying gifted children. It is recommended that strategies for motivating gifted children include helping the child plan his occupational goal, finding individuals in the community who could assist teachers in developing their student's occupational model, developing communications with parents, and providing concrete  experiences that allow students to explore their talents and discover their potential. Teachers are encouraged to create an environment in which community situations are the basis for learning and to develop students' leadership potential, especially at junior and senior high school levels.

It was reported that a total performance increment of 131 level achievements was attained, that these level achievements required a total teaching time of 51  hours and 24 minutes, and that a total number of 12,817 interactions between student-trainees and Ss were used to establish the achievement levels. All instruction was accomplished by 34 trainees (20 staff members of institutions for the MR, six nursery school teachers, and eight mothers of retarded children) who had previously participated in a 45 hour training program on operant conditioning tactics. The achievement levels and their consequential arrangement were described in detail. (GW)",

The authors maintain that, by using the processes of recognition, interaction, and mobility as criteria for the developmental levels of awareness, manipulation, and posture, it becomes possible to assess reception of sensory stimuli and development of recognition processes separately from the assessment of fine and gross motor skills and mobility skills. Described are items of the Awareness Scale which elicit defensive reactions to aversive stimuli, entice the child to draw closer to pleasurable sensations, and evaluate the child's ability to combine  memory of past events with the stimulus of the moment. The Manipulation Scale is designed to appraise a child's inclination to handle objects spontaneously, to respond to gestured and spoken commands, and to communicate needs and desires through language (with or without words). The Posture Scale is said to evaluate ability to maintain a secure position in space in both stationary and movement states. It is noted that the test is without statistical validation, but that it has been helpful in identifying children who are alert but lack the motor capacity to express that alertness. (GW)",

A more intensive study was made of 192 aggressive-disruptive and 192 prosocial children. Data included interviews, individual tests (such as the Kvaraceus Delinquency Proneness Scale), family rating by means of the Glueck Family Interaction factors and data on intelligence and academic achievement as reported in school records. Among the findings after 8 years were that 48% of the aggressive-disruptive group were found to have police records as compared to 22% of the prosocial group. Family factors found more commonly in the aggressive-disruptive children included  inappropriate paternal discipline and inadequate maternal supervision. In school the aggressive-disruptive children were characterized by lower IQs and increasing gaps between achievement levels and expected performances. The Glueck measure was found to be a more effective predictive instrument than the Kvaraceus scale. Rank in high school graduating class was predicted by a multiple correlation of .88, while social adjustment was reported to be predicted with a multiple correlation of .82. Incidence of police contacts was predicted with 69% accuracy and juvenile court appearances with 76% accuracy. (DB)",

Offered is a model of educational planning which would include more mechanized schools and a higher ratio of pupils per teacher. Dr. Clayton Morgan explores aspects of human potential and suggests that limiting the expected achievements of the handicapped does them a great disservice. Dr. Frank Hewitt considers the dilemma of special versus regular classroom placement. He describes  the Madison Plan which groups children having learning difficulties together in a progressive preacademic and academic program of classroom skills. Dr. Carolyn Vash stresses the necessity for a conceptual view of man and offers her own philosophy as a basis for rehabilitation programs.

Four instructional sequences consider assessment of interfering behaviors, eliciting attending behaviors, using teacher-attention to modify behavior, and devising and implementing a reinforcement system, respectively. Evaluation is by pre- and post-course videotapes of typical 15 minute classroom segments. The first instructional sequence provides theory and practice in the development of observational skills for assessing student attending problems. The second sequence further develops teacher skills through the discussion of attending behavior, student examples, and  the establishment of rules for attending behavior. Considered during the third instructional sequence is the use of teacher attention to modify behavior with specific attention to means of using approval responses, of relating approval to student responses, and of redistributing teacher attention. The final instructional sequence develops a reinforcement strategy and gives guidance in establishing and enforcing contingencies. Considerable space is provided in the handbook for responses by the teacher. See EC 051 387 for the project report. (DB)",

Observable classroom behaviors associated with various perceptual motor and psychomotor disabilities (visual-motor channel disability, auditory-vocal channel disability, decoding process disability, association process disability, endcoding process disability, auditory-vocal automatic disability, and sequencing disability) are identified, along with suggested individual and group teaching techniques. Discussed are remedial and developmental activities designed to improve auditory reception, visual reception, visual sequential memory, auditory association, auditory sequential memory, visual-motor  association, verbal expressions or encoding, manual expressions, motor coordination and perception, visual closure, and grammatic closure. Activities such as the following are recommended: associating directional movements with drawing of a line on chalkboard or paper (visual reception), tracing dot-to-dot pictures (visual sequential memory), asking cause and effect questions related to noise making activities (auditory association), making scrapbooks on a certain theme such as facial expressions, furniture, or toys (visual-motor association), and role playing with homemade costumes, situations or puppets (verbal expressions). Records, tapes, and books related to the above disability areas are listed in the appendixes. (GW)",

The Youth Services Bureau in Texas is said to focus on the problems of Mexican-American youth and to emphasize the use of existing service agencies to assist youth with problems. The Indiana Youth Advocacy program is described in terms of its adult and youth participants, including a doctoral candidate in counseling psychology, a young lawyer, and a student at the program's Street  Academy. It is explained that the Community Services Project in California involved a small town with a large Mexican-American ancestry which was catapulted from an agricultural center to a community predominantly dependent upon the aerospace industry. Efforts of the Community Services Project are said to be reflected in the SMILE Project (Something Meaningful in Local Effort) which has established a community information referral service, has fostered cooperation among existing service agencies, and has helped to establish new projects when necessary.

Project LIFE is said to employ a series of visual perceptual filmstrips and a thinking activities series to teach the pre-skills necessary for a child to experience success in the language/reading program. The language/reading program is designed to teach vocabulary, sentence structure, and more sophisticated language structures in units focusing on general topical themes (self, animals, food, playthings, activities, clothing, shelter, history, travel, and pollution control). All instructional areas of the  LIFE system are said to be accompanied by stated purposes and behavioral objectives, and to provide the conceptual base and framework on which the major pedagogic concepts for subsequent lessons are based. Programed filmstrips in visual perception, thinking activities, and language/reading are identified as the core program components, while supplemental components are said to include software such as story booklets, single concept flash cards, picture dictionaries, transparencies, and teacher guides. It is explained that evaluation and validation data are drawn from 52 field test centers each academic year, and that the program is disseminated by a commercial distributor. (GW)",

Early strategy decisions are said to have involved obtaining a teaching machine which would be equipped with a four button response mode for discrimination frames and which would be capable of presenting programed language to hearing impaired children visually and auditorily. In the program's second stage, specialists in language, deaf education, and systems design are reported to have developed new strategy decisions in response to observations showing that hearing impaired children react favorably to programed instruction and colored art; that  some children could not associate experience and symbols; and that some of the initial programs had no predetermined objectives or set levels of difficulty and complexity. Present programing is said to include behavioral analysis of objectives, planning for student responses, designing frames that challenge but do not overwhelm the child, and structuring materials to students' emotional and cognitive developmental levels. It is explained that program revisions are now made on data obtained from an average of 10 students per program, that the Program Master provides immediate confirmation and reinforcement for each correct response, that the programs are geared to individual differences, and that the programs are being validated at many field test centers.

Ss' sorting responses were coded according to the following categories: syncretic strategies (level one), perceptual strategies (level two), low associative strategies (level three), and superordinate and categorical strategies (level four). In the third sort of the SORTS test, 13% of the EMR Ss sorted the items into groupings  classified as associative or better. By contrast, 55% of the nonretarded sample produced groupings at the same level. Recall scores of the two groups showed the NR sample to have remembered an average of nearly four items more than the EMR sample. EMR children who had grouped associatively showed significant correlations between recall and clustering. A similar significant correlation was not observed for the NR sample. Training activities designed to teach children to seek better relations among stimuli in learning tasks were recommended. (GW)",

Explained are the different court systems (federal courts, state courts, district courts, appeals courts, and supreme courts) and the abstention doctrine which enables federal court judges to refuse to hear cases which are thought to be the responsibility of state courts. Preparation for the trial is discussed in terms of complaints, pleadings, answers, defenses, replies, amendments, motions, discovery, expert witnesses, and the roles that experts may serve in the litigation process. Also explained are trial by jury, the actual steps of a trial, conditions creating the necessity for an appeal, the nature of the appeal, legal precedent, and determinants of the merit of court decisions.

The hypotheses developed were that the subjects with high expectancy would perform better and require less instruction, set higher performance criteria for themselves, and have higher expectancy on a transfer task than subjects with low expectancies. The results of the experiment rejected all three hypotheses; the author suspected that dissonance feedback was the cause. Further investigation, however, revealed that the dissonance was not related to a significant difference in performance changes in the same subject. The author concluded that the study demonstrated that dissonance is more likely to lead to changes in expectancies than to  changes in performance. (MC)",

From these four elements it is possible to derive optimal instructional strategies. A theory of instruction is, in fact, a special case of what has come to be known in mathematical and engineering literature as optimal control theory. Precisely the same problems are posed in the area of instruction except that the system to be controlled is the human learner. To the extent that the above four  criteria can be formulated explicitly, methods of the control theory can be used to derive optimal instructional strategies. Two examples involving the derivation of such strategies are considered in this paper: a computer-assisted instruction program for early reading and an individualized program for learning a foreign language vocabulary. Both are analyzed on control theoretic principles. (Author/MC)",

The hypotheses, methodology, and conclusions of the overall program are briefly discussed as they pertain to the feedback aspect. (The CAI program dealt with the effects of choice situations upon the students' engagement in learning. Subjects were chosen from Grade 4 and 5 classes in a low income area elementary school.) Since the experiment depended on evaluation by observation, the researchers felt it necessary to have a good operational rapport with the school personnel. The teachers provided information that verified some of the researchers' expectations concerning the effect of social determinants on choice behavior. This report was compiled from information  collected by questionnaire and discussion. (MC)",

Using a three part written questionnaire, the investigators polled 99 school districts throughout the United States and examined the responses of 55. Two major hypotheses were tested: 1) the difference in the frequency with which the benefits resulted from various applications; and 2) the various benefits which resulted from different means of development. The study reported several conclusions: 1) the most frequent computer uses were for financial accounting applications with personnel applications second; 2) contractor staffs are used less often than inhouse personnel; 3) most of the applications in use were designed for first or second  generation computers; and 4) the financial applications were the most operable and successful of all the applications. The report noted that it is quite apparent that school districts are not reaping the rewards of third generation computers. (MC)",

        "description":"Reminiscence, or an increase in retention scores from a short-to-long-term retention test, has been shown in some previous work to be a significant function of arousal. Previous studies of the effects of color versus black-and-white audiovisual presentations have generally used film or television and have found no facilitating effect of color on learning or achievement. No such studies, however, have specifically studied reminiscence, although there is reason to believe that color would be more arousing than black-and-white and thus should facilitate reminiscence. The present experiment examined reminiscence over one week as a function of color versus black-and-white slide-tape presentations. It was found that the proportion of subjects reminiscing in the color condition was  significantly greater (p.05, one-tailed test) than the proportion reminiscing in the black-and-white condition. No contribution of a measure of individual differences in arousal or stimulation seeking was obtained. The relative lack of strength of the color effect was noted, and some design considerations for further research on learning and memory effects of color were outlined. (Author/MC)",

The combined hardware and manuals allowed the researcher to interact with the material being developed with a minimum of interference from photo-electronic operations. This project demonstrated that it is practical for writers to use sophisticated and complex half-inch video systems to facilitate the development of instructional materials. The usability, reliability, and maintainability is adequate to enable a researcher who is not a trained electronic or photographic technician to use the  equipment without undue curtailment or restrictions imposed by the electronics and media production techniques involved. This maximizes the attention to content and instructional methodology and facilitates revision based on initial tryout of prototypic instructional sequences.

Student teachers' performance in the classroom was recorded by videotape technicians once or twice during their student teaching experience, and the tapes were delivered to supervisors as a supplement to in-person visits. Student teachers allowed to view recording of their teaching displayed favorable attitudes towards this use of VTR, while those not allowed to see tapes of their performance exhibited more negative attitudes. Supervisors' failure to give any feedback at all on a teacher's recorded performances resulted in even more negative student teacher attitudes toward this use of  VTR. The student teachers wanted to know ahead of time that their performance would be recorded. Supervisors were moderately favorable towards this use of VTR, but they felt it was inferior to and more time-consuming than live observation. The costs for 17 all-day recording sessions and 12 videotapes totaled $512.69. This use of VTR appears helpful and feasible. Several recommendations for its use are made. (JK)",

A total of 600 eleventh grade history students was surveyed. Results showed that mass media was the primary source used by all groups: in particular television newscasts, newspapers, and documentary films were influential. Both Canadian groups used these media more than Americans did. The second most important source was the school, although this was a minor source for both Canadian groups. In all groups, the teacher has the dominant individual role, while textbooks are next in importance. Films and educational television have only a minor role in school information. Third in importance  was influence of the peer group, and least important was religion. This study negates earlier studies by showing that the home has changed from an information-poor environment to an information-rich one, due to television. The schools are falling behind in their role as an agent of socialization. Schools should utilize the mass media far more than they do presently. (JK)",

Discrimination between concept classes can be illustrated by use of a Venn diagram. Examples of concepts and concept classes are either convergent (their irrelevant attributes are as similar as possible) or divergent (their irrelevant attributes are as different as possible). The most  effective relationship between examples and nonexamples of a concept is matched: that is, an example and a nonexample have similar irrelevant attributes. In that case, the only difference between them is the critical attributes of the concept. Examples of concepts can also be discriminated between on the grounds of whether they are easy or hard.

The competence of the native speaker includes the skill to manipulate and vary pronouns through discourse. It is suggested that an objective of Thai language instruction should be to duplicate the behavior represented by that skill and to discover and teach the rules governing  manipulations such as pronoun deletion and noun switching in sentence sequences.

(3) 94% of all college students who were married and were living with their spouse lived in their own households. (4) Only 56% of the students enrolled in college in October 1971 were  living with their parents during the preceding summer. (5) There was some net movement back to the county of residence of parents following college graduation. (Author/HS)",

        "description":"A model for community services that stresses the necessity and value of community involvement in the planning of community service activities is presented. The role of the community service sector of the educational institution is to establish a center which will provide leadership in uniting and coordinating community efforts to meet individual and community needs. Community input into the identification of community needs and resources must be sought after by maintaining constant communication with community leaders, members of organizations which comprise the local bureaucratic understructure, key informants, and the general population. Community members must be led into playing an active role in the planning of community services. Once needs and resources are identified,  community members must become the mobilizers of the resources, the initiators of action, and ultimately, the determinant of the success or failure of community service programs. To provide a structural component which demands active community involvement, the use of advisory committees made up of community members is recommended. The effective use of these committees results in the advantageous shifting of the responsibility for community services from the educational institution to groups of individual citizens.

Options available were lecture, small group, programmed instruction, directed study and community involvement, and students were encouraged to try a variety of approaches. Six questions relating to achievement and retention rate were explored using both univariate and multivariate methods. Results indicated no significant differences between the experimental group and the control section. It was further pointed out retention rate was higher for the control section.

        "description":"The development of a pre-service training program over a three-year period for faculty at Burlington County College, New Jersey is discussed. Burlington County College, which began operation in the Fall of 1969, emphasizes various modes of instruction, with the long-range goal of facilitating individualized instruction. Summaries of six revisions made to the pre-service program are presented. The objectives, procedures, and evaluations of the 1969, 70, and 71 programs are provided, and a field test made at Ocean County College is described. Following the field test, final revision was made of the pre-service program. The program not only influenced basic attitudes, but provided new faculty with knowledge and skills needed. The major contributions of the project were as follows:  (1) a collection of validated learning objectives for a faculty pre-service program, sequenced in a rational fashion, and keyed to materials available to any institution; (2) some very useful instruments--a validated pre-service attitude questionnaire; a validated quiz on those aspects essential to understanding the students in the community college; an annotated bibliography on pre-service and in-service training of community college faculty; and a checklist of items to send to new faculty members prior to their arrival on campus; and (3) a chronological record of the program development. Appendixes provide 1969, 1970, 1971 Pre-Service Program Outlines; Final Version of Burlington County College Pre-Service Program; Checklist of Materials Sent to New Faculty Prior to Arriving on Campus;  Evaluation Summaries for 1969, 1970, 1971 Pre-Service Programs; Evaluation Summary of Field Test; and Annotated Bibliography.

        "description":"Phases two and three of an evaluation of an innovative approach to English Composition instruction at Long Beach City College are reported. In the innovative approach, each class was divided into two groups of 15 students each, which met twice each week to discuss topics for writing, to read and revise first drafts of papers, and to discuss basic writing problems as they arose. In addition, the students were to spend one hour each week working on writing problems with teachers and teacher aides. In Phase Two, a comparison was made of 136 final essays of 150 students (67 TBA, i.e., experimental, and 69 traditional). All of the essays were written under controlled conditions. The results were tabulated on an essay score sheet which allowed tabulation of 7 rhetorical variables and  14 non-standard features; in addition a tabulation was made of total errors, error-word ratios, and error-sentence ratios. Analysis of the data is provided. The results of the analysis show that the non-TBA students were more successful in eliminating errors than were the TBA students. In Phase Three, performance in transfer-level English Composition (English 1A) was studied. Criterion variables used were: the tendency to enroll in transfer English Composition; the tendency to complete or persist in English 1A; the ratio of achievement grades earned; and the ratio of penalty grades earned. Results of the study showed that the traditional population demonstrated a greater tendency to enroll in the transfer composition course, the difference being at the .05 level of significance. It is  concluded that both types of courses equally prepare students for transfer Freshman English. The Essay Score Sheet and tables are provided. (DB)",

Summaries of the replies are provided in seven tables. Observations resulting from the survey data include the following: (1) 87% of the colleges indicated they &quot;screen,&quot; select, or use some procedure which attempts to place students at an appropriate level of English Composition; (2) 13% allowed students to enroll in a course of their choosing or indicated that English 1A did not have prerequisites; (3) colleges with less than 10 contract instructors in the English Department were more likely to allow students to choose their course; (4) 89% of the  colleges that screen their students incorporate an objective examination, such as the American College Testing Program English Test and the Cooperative English Tests, English Expression, in their placement procedure. For grade 13 or entering Freshman students, the median minimum score reported for placement in transfer level English Composition is the 60th percentile; (5) only 52% reported at least some degree of satisfaction with the test(s) they were using; (6) 7% of those colleges that place students into defined levels use a sample of the students' writing ability only; 43% use both essay and objective test; (7) 81% ask entering students for entrance or placement test data for admission to the college; (8) 65% administered a standardized reading test; and (9) 30% require students who  score below average on reading tests to enroll in a reading class.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the utility of a structural-developmental approach as a basis for a philosophy of education for the public community college of the Midwestern United States. The structural-developmental approach was explored within the broader cognitive studies of the Piagetian tradition in America. The method of research employed was a combination of analysis of relevant literature and empirical investigation at a community college. A research instrument was used to assess the cognitive stage of development of critical groups of students. The drop, course withdrawal, grade point average, and cognitive stage data of lower ability vocational-technical, lower ability transfer, and upper ability students were compared and analyzed, with a .05 level of  significance as the criterion for differences. The following conclusions were drawn from the findings and the results of the analyzed information: (1) there is a need for a broadly based psychology of education in the community college movement; (2) vocational/technical programs provided no unique solution to the breadth of the educational task; (3) diversity in student capability demanded a more universal basis for a philosophy of education; (4) the myth that the Piagetian tradition was age-bound at a level below community college functions was destroyed; (5) Piagetian tradition provided a universal kind of basis for a philosophy of education; (6) natural diversity of the college was conducive to a broadly based psychology of the individual student; (7) cognitive stages were found to be  relevant to the educational process of the college; and (8) a cognitive-developmental approach in grades 13 and 14 would provide continuity.

A random sample of 763 graduates was sent a questionnaire, and approximately 48.7% responded. Of the 372 who responded, 200 had transferred to senior colleges. The questionnaire data are tabulated. These data show a high correlation between the educational programs chosen by the graduates in the city college and in senior institutions. Of the graduates who were working, 49% were employed in a job that was related to their city  college program, and 68% felt that the city college courses had given them specific skills that were job related; 68.9% indicated that they had either taken additional courses or that they planned to do so. In comparing the 1965 graduate with the 1972 graduate of the City Colleges of Chicago, it was found that the 1972 class graduated in a shorter period of time. The breakdown as to baccalaureate-oriented program and occupational program showed that there was a high degree of comparability between 1965 and 1972 graduates. There was an increase in the number of graduates entering public senior institutions in 1972. Full-time students in senior colleges increased from 75% in 1965 to 85% in 1972; 61% of the 1972 full-time students were gainfully employed compared with 50% of the 1965  graduates. (DB)",

At the beginning of the spring semester of 1970-71, freshmen who did not return were compared with those who returned on a number of variables, including high school average, high school curriculum, reading score, type of high school attended, and admissions classification (would have been rejected in 1969 for inadequate high school  average, would have been rejected for subject-matter insufficiencies, or would have met 1969 requirements). The most important finding is the apparent absence of clear or strong relationships between the entry variables and the tendency to drop out after one semester. This is indicated despite the relationships linking high school mathematics (amount and proficiency) and the type of high school to the dropout rate. The open-admissions student does not show a significantly higher dropout rate than the \"fully qualified\" student. A replication of this study covering an entire academic year is recommended, as well as studies of the influence of non-scholastic factors on the tendency to drop out. (KM)",

A region's needs can be surveyed and met best by junior and four-year schools that are close enough together so that the two-year colleges can specify their needs and the four-year colleges can meet them. Before the start of Western Washington State College's M.A. program for junior college English teachers, 25 junior college English teachers from the area were invited to comment on the program. They recommended two internships--one early in the program and one at the end--to center on composition, one on transfer writing and one on developmental writing. On these teachers' recommendation that a junior college English teacher needed to learn  student-centered techniques for teaching writing, the Macrorie approach to composition, \"Telling Writing,\" was taught to the interns. The premises of this approach are that students are the best commentators on their peers' writing and that they can best learn to write if they write first about their own experience. Students worked as aides at Western before their internship. The program and the Macrorie approach were considered quite successful, especially in building self-confidence about writing. (KM)",

Since the struggles of the two groups for liberation are not separate, the needs of women students at community colleges should be important to faculty. It is maintained that at Manhattan Community College students' needs are not being met as far as physical environment, curriculum, vocational training, or faculty and administration attitudes are concerned. About 2/3 of the women students are black and Puerto Rican; about 1/3 are white working class. Women students as a group are less motivated than men, have lower aspirations, and are tracked into limited female service occupations. One of the results of a long period of student militance  at MCC was a demand for women's studies courses. In designing the course Images of Women in Literature, it was discovered that little writing about third world women, or working class women in general, exists. Consequently, the course was designed both to give women the knowledge about themselves that will help to liberate them and to motivate them to write about themselves. The women in the course have produced poems, plays, autobiographies, films, children's stories, and research papers. The increased consciousness led to the formation in 1971 of The Women's Union to improve education and working conditions for all women--teachers, students and secretaries--at the school. (KM)",

        "description":"Junior and community colleges must explode many traditional notions about education in order to fulfill their promises to poor and disadvantaged students. The number of junior and community colleges and the number of students attending them have increased rapidly in the past few years. But many communities think that community colleges didn't keep their promises. Most community college students are poor, and college costs are frequently high. Students frequently cannot get into the job training programs they want because of staff, space and money shortages. To work toward fulfilling community college ideals, ideas about student and teacher roles and about ways of measuring success must be changed. Teachers must help students improve their self concept and gain self confidence,  processes which teachers with Ph.D.'s may damage because of a condescending attitude. Good community colleges have stopped using standards based on exclusiveness, a major shift in attitude and procedures, both in curriculum design and in course grading. The CCCC Guidelines recognize the broadened definition of junior college education and the necessity of adapting the training of two-year college English teachers to it. The Guidelines take a stand against racism in training programs but not sexism. Junior colleges are one of the best places to change racist and sexist attitudes because students come there with great faith in education. (KM)",

There is an increasing awareness among culturally different (disadvantaged) groups that they have not had the same opportunity to compete in the contest for upward mobility as other Americans. Public two-year colleges, if they serve these groups, provide such opportunities and prevent the threat to the social order these groups can present. A study was conducted to explore the extent to which two-year colleges are committed to open admissions policies, comprehensive curricula, and compensatory education programs. A sample of public two-year  colleges were surveyed via questionnaire. Results showed that: (1) almost all two-year colleges have personal, academic, vocational-occupational, and job placement counseling; (2) only about half have the curricular offerings and admissions policies expected of public community colleges; (3) 12 percent have special courses in ethnic studies; and (4) about half have special programs for the academically disadvantaged. It is recommended that colleges recruit in the ghettos, devote more resources to training faculty to deal with disadvantaged minority group students, and develop more courses in ethnic studies.

It is a varied, challenging and rewarding responsibility, for the hospital medical librarian can provide a very dynamic and useful information service to her institution's community of health professionals.

The focus is on the period from 1975 to 1980, a time close enough to the present that some projections and predictions may be based on more than guesswork, yet far enough away that there is still time to plan and implement plans. After a brief introductory section, this essay deals in turn with economic trends, technology trends, and social trends, as each is likely to influence information needs. Some suggestions for meeting the needs indicated by these trends are interspersed throughout. The concluding section highlights the major questions concerning national information policy that are raised by the  trends discussed. (Author/NH)",

        "description":"Search for an integrated, comprehensive theory of information science (IS) has so far been unsuccessful. Appearance of a theory has been retarded by one central constraint, the large number of disciplines concerned with human communication. Crossdisciplinary interdependence occurs in two ways: theoretical relation of IS phenomena to a given science, and practical relation of the science to IS dissemination of its contributions. We are concerned here with the first. The main difficulty in making IS models is the above mentioned interaction of many sciences of communication. Prominent among these are physics, biology, psychology, library science, computer science, several social sciences, applied logic and mathematics, and not least, cybernetics. That cybernetics should apply to IS  is not a new idea. But more precision has emerged recently. Cybernetics is now seen to underlie nearly all IS phenomena through two central concepts: variety, and the law of requisite variety. The last provides a quantitative approach to system regulation and control. IS concerns regulatory activity in typically large, goal-seeking systems. That is, propagation of meaningful human messages between sender and recipient on an &quot;IS path&quot; is a goal-seeking process. (Author)",

Data were collected by the interview method from a total of eighteen employees; each of whom were actively involved in one of the ILL/TWX offices of the five institutions visited. The TWX network is operating reasonably well for the four state university libraries. There was no indication that a major ILL/TWX crisis existed between or among the respective institutions. However, this is not to say that everyone has a clear picture of the current objectives, eventual direction, and outcome of the TWX network and its operation at the university level. In any case,  past action among the four state university libraries indicates that as ILL/TWX problems arose, steps were taken to arrive at a satisfactory solution. The ILL/TWX offices of these four institutions do not depend heavily upon the State Library for either leadership or service. Rather, they look to one another, as well as, other major lending libraries outside the State of Indiana for materials which are largely theoretical, scholarly, or esoteric in nature. (Author/NH)",

The two primary areas of investigation covered in this report are: (1) pilot conversion to machine readable form of a portion of the NYSL shelf list; the purpose of this conversion process itself being the creation of a file of machine readable records which can be searched by a computer under the control of a telecommunication computer terminal. The purpose of the pilot conversion test is to determine costs of conversion, and  any unusual technical problems; and (2) experimentation with, and use of, the initial product of the pilot conversion in catalog searching. The purpose of the search test is to determine technical feasibility of the search process where a user must formulate a query as a logical combination of alphabetic search words, a process far different than the mental eye-brain scanning of entries on catalog cards.

Background work for these major objectives involved searching and reviewing the literature concerned with user studies and specifications for future library services. Consideration was also given to those planning methodologies that would be applicable to the development of future library and information services. This study concentrated on the special needs of identifiable subgroups in the population rather than on the needs of typical users who constitute the bulk of the public library clientele. All of these subgroups  were identified and studied in terms of single variables, such as age, economic level, or housing location and were found to have information needs somewhat different from the needs of the general population. No effort was made to identify any subgroups in terms of multi-variable descriptions, such as the term \"disadvantaged\" might imply. This type of multi-variable analysis would be a very useful follow-up study. (Author/NH)",

The ANSI format structure was designed to accommodate records for all kinds of materials used by different groups of users, and this format structure has been used for the MARC formats for books, serials, maps, films, and music developed at the Library of Congress. The MARC manuscript format provides specifications and content designators (tags, indicators, and subfield codes to identify data in a machine record) for manuscript collections and single  manuscripts. Since the Library of Congress does not have any immediate plans to distribute records of this kind on magnetic tape, the publication of this format is intended for the use of other institutions involved in creating machine-readable records for manuscripts. Map and music manuscripts can be handled by this format in conjunction with the additional data elements or content designators in the MARC formats.

Because information on the library user was almost nonexistent in San Francisco, a major portion of the study effort  was allocated to a system-wide and main library user survey as well as a staff and children's questionnaire. No comprehensive survey of the library user had ever been done, and the present circulation system is not an efficient vehicle for data collection and analysis.

The purpose was to increase their competence in planning, developing and evaluating effective system-wide media programs. The need for such competence has been sharply accentuated by recent state legislative actions and subsequent policy changes by the Department of Education which mandated an appraisal of all programs as to effectiveness, efficiency, and utilization of resources. The seminar approach was used, enabling participants to exchange views and reinforce principles. Emphasis was placed on the  development of evaluative instruments, implementation of standards, procedures to assure accountability, and on the design of needs assessment as they relate to school media programs. Presentations to the entire group was made by staff members and visiting lecturers in order to impart information needed by all of the participants. This document is a record of those presentations.

Activities during this phase included completion of the design and programming details of the software system, development of a prototype of the software system, acquisition of selected data bases, development of operational procedures, operation of experimental current awareness search services with interim software, seminars for library personnel, and the establishment of procedures for the transfer of the operation to the library. Two highlights of the phase were the outstanding success of the experimental current awareness service and the establishment of a CIS unit in the library.  (Author)",

The author was head of an American graduate library school for nine years, and immediately thereafter, 1967-68, as a Fulbright Professor, headed an Iranian library school for thirteen months. Rather than attempt to compare library education in the two countries, almost as large an undertaking as comparing the two parent institutions, Drexel University (then Drexel Institute of Technology), in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the Faculty of Education, University of Tehran, this analysis focuses primarily on a narrower and more manageable subject, the two positions themselves, dean vs. chairman. This is the story of their comparisons and contrasts, their rewards  and problems, one important variable being held constant, the nature of the position as a university graduate library school headship. Most of the comparisons will be made after juxtaposing information from each position, topic by topic. (Related documents are: LI 004245 through LI 004267.) (Author)",

Its basic assumption is that all of the goals and most of the essential principles of American library science are as appropriate to modern Iran as to modern America. Furthermore, many practical library procedures can be borrowed from the U.S.A. A further assumption is that the foreigner is seldom familiar enough with Iran to know all of the ideas which should be incorporated or to make all of the changes necessary in adapting either library education or standards for local use. Consequently, Iranian assistance is essential in writing and revising adaptations in both fields. A final assumption is that most Iranians  want their libraries improved.

While Iran has several foreign schools, libraries and librarians, there are no Iranian professional school librarians to take an interest in the standards. Furthermore, the present low state of Iranian school libraries suggests that many years may pass before a large percentage of them will meet these standards. Certain librarians have criticized all six sets of library standards for being too detailed, almost for resembling policy and procedure manuals. This detailed treatment was deliberate. Attempts to get a library procedure manual published have been unsuccessful, so far, and the original purpose of the standards  was to provide as much guidance as possible for Iranian librarians. Without guidelines, many new Iranian librarians would be uncertain about how to organize and develop their libraries. With these detailed standards, for the first time they had policy guidelines which contained some procedural details, also. The school library standards assume the presence of a desire among faculty members and administrators to develop teaching techniques which de-emphasize the traditional Iranian lecture and textbook methods, and instead, emphasize pupil-oriented instruction and the use of a variety of teaching materials.

It assumes that many similarities exist between the selection policies of the two countries, but that special problems and contrasts exist in each one, also. The paper concentrates on the policies of two specific institutions, Drexel University, previously, Drexel Institute of Technology, Philadelphia, Pa., U.S.A., and the Iranian Documentation Centre (Irandoc), Tehran, Iran. One is an academic library, the other a government agency documentation center. They are alike in some striking ways but are very different in others. In spite of the absence of data and analyses needed to support an objective study, the author draws two conclusions based on his personal observation  and experience. The influence of nationalism on serial subscription policies in Iran and America must be recognized. Probably it is common in libraries over the world to find large numbers of local titles on hand. Also, whenever local pride or nationalism and strong library service ideas are combined, then a rich representation of local serials may be expected, as a way of providing good service to local users.

It is not assumed that these items are of equal importance, nor that they are of equal urgency in every country, nor that priorities should be equal everywhere.

He is the product of both a general increase in awareness of other countries' importance and of developing countries' growing awareness of their need for outside assistance. Their need is basic--the International Man's knowledge and ability are scarce locally, perhaps even non-existent. There is considerable literature on the business executive as  International Man but very little on the government or service field executive or advisor in this role, and very little material on the International Man as a person.

Though somewhat different from the sets of library standards, the translation, approval, and recommendation program prescribed for this document was much the same as that prescribed for the library standards. In 1969, the Institute for Research and Planning in Science and Education asked for Tehran Book Processing Centre Planning  Department cooperation in evaluating the new Tabriz and Iranzamin library education programs. When a formal higher education evaluation program is evolved, it seems likely that the Institute will follow its own precedent in asking the Centre to continue its work in this field. The same reasoning seems valid for library standards, since the Institute requested Planning Department assistance in evaluating and improving several academic and special libraries in 1969 and 1970.

During this stay, 30 libraries in five cities were visited. This paper describes this trip and relates the library happenings in these countries. It was obvious that Pakistan librarianship had advanced beyond the profession in either Iran or Afghanistan. There were many more librarians, more of them capable, more curiosity about foreign ideas, more concern for the present, larger book collections, larger buildings, more library schools, more active library associations, and more library publication. Yet all of this development has occurred in university and special libraries, not in school or public libraries, typical of Southwest Asia. And the picture  seemed to be standing still or else moving ahead very slowly, as if the librarians had been trained before the nation was ready to support them. There seemed to be no evidence of a surge forward in public libraries, as there was in Iran or of major budget support for university libraries as there was in Ankara. Furthermore, the problem of over population had to be dealt with successfully or there would never be per capita improvement. Since Pakistan's economy was moving rapidly ahead, perhaps good library budgets and new building plans would also come, but one wonders if a country now so poor would support good library service even in the next generation.

This paper's purpose is to provide practical suggestions for scholars about overcoming the difficulties of using Asian libraries. It is intended to assist researchers in all fields, including those working on dissertations, and is written to help them change a frustrating and disappointing year into one more rewarding. These remarks are applicable for those parts of Asia which the author has visited: India, Pakistan, eleven more moslem, one Hebrew and one Christian country extending West to the U.A.R. and  North to Turkey--and for those researchers whose material location problems are similar to the Asian reference problems with which the author has already dealt.

These hypotheses provide a background for four questions concerning early childhood education: (1) What kinds of goals make sense? Are we committed to academic goals, which involve fulfilling requirements and getting good scores, or intellectual goals, which involve inquiry and experimentation? (2) What do we have to do to accomplish these goals? Open classrooms, in which students pursue their own interests and acquire skills as tools with which to study their environment, are  recommended. Behavior modification techniques should be used only with knowledge of the reasons for the behaviors exhibited. (3) What qualities of teachers are needed to realize these goals? To be effective, teachers must be both warm and strong. (4) What administrative qualities must exist to meet these goals? The qualities of the administration--leadership style, friction/supportiveness--are reflected in interaction between teachers and students. (KM)",

Information was collected from regional office staff and from Head Start directors, nurses, teachers, teacher aides, and teacher trainers. Teacher and staff reaction to the guide, the training they received in its use, and its effectiveness in the classroom are discussed. The information and recommendations in these areas are intended to be of use to the Office of Child Development in introducing the guide to other centers, revising the guide, and training teachers in its use. The report also includes a parent interview (in English and Spanish) designed with Head Start parents for possible use in subsequent evaluation. Problems in this  evaluation were created because a large number of centers were not using the guide, many having never received it. These and other operational problems at Office of Child Development headquarters have resulted in confusion at the local level. Wide variation was found in the way the guide has been introduced and in staff training in its use; training appears to have been poorly planned and coordinated. Most directors, teachers and teacher trainers are enthusiastic about the guide. So few parent handbooks have been distributed that their reactions to it cannot yet be ascertained. Many Head Start teachers were not using any health education materials previously. (KM)",

        "description":"The nature of on-going instructional processes and pupil experiences were studied in two classes of a British infant school. Using PROSE (Personal Record of School Experience) as the primary observation instrument, 24 children, aged five through seven years, equally divided as to sex, were observed during seven days. A total of 9 cycles and 45 events were recorded for each of the children. The events relate to the nature of contacts (verbal or nonverbal) that the child has with adults, peers, and materials. Results of the study are provided as to: General Organizational Patterns; Teacher Behavior and Expectancies; Teacher Questioning; Instructional Teaching and Content; Manifest Teacher Affect; Pupil Behavior; Adult Contacts; Peer Contacts; Task Involvement and the Nature of  Tasks; Manifest Affect of Pupils; and Pupil Behavior Differences. Some of the noteworthy findings are: (1) certain teacher expectancies were apparent in directions given and behavior reinforced; (2) for about half of each school day, children were involved in projects and activities of their own choosing, with teachers providing general supervisory and tutorial assistance; (3) the most dominant type of teacher activity during these periods was listening to children and raising questions about activities and progress; (4) some teacher differences were seen in showing-telling activities and in controlling behavior; (5) over the entire school day, children interacted with an adult 29.3% of time on the average, with a peer 20.4%, with appropriate tasks 28.2%, and were inappropriately engaged  22.1% of the time. The study data are given in 17 tables. [Filmed from best available copy.] (DB)",

A modification of the laboratory training method, here called the &quot;participant group method,&quot; was used with low-income Black parents of Head Start children to demonstrate under what conditions participant groups might be helpful to parents and their children. Eight different groups, each met twice a week for eight weeks within the context of either helping the child with language skills at home or helping the parents with their problems of child-rearing. Parent trainers worked in teams of two, including a mother from the community. Both fathers and mothers participated. Most groups succeeded in engaging the parents' participation in child-rearing or related discussions, as judged from the  attendance and the group process data. In conclusion, the participant group method seems to be a very effective vehicle to deliver community-clinical psychological services directly to low-income parents for educational, remedial, and preventive functions regarding their preschool children.

This reorientation is that of conducting more research &quot;on&quot; practice. Answers to be sought by research &quot;on&quot; practice in Head Start curriculum models relate to what factors (variables) exist that either inhibit or facilitate the implementation of each model. Four broad classes of variables are: model variables, modeler variables, teacher and staff variables, and general on-site variables. Brief examples of each variable potentially affecting implementability of curriculum models are outlined. In addition to research &quot;on&quot; practice, it is also felt that there should be a modification of the focus of the research and development efforts concerning teachers and  teaching. Included in these efforts should be causes of teacher behavior. Causes related to role relationships--teacher behavior determined by children, parents, other school personnel--and causes related to the larger social context should be examined. It is hoped that a sociology of early childhood education will be developed. References are provided. (DB)",

The programs are: Akron, The PEP-IPI Model; Cleveland, The Responsive Environment Model; Dayton, The Engelmann-Becker Model; and Martins Ferry, The Mathemagenic Activities Model. The PEP (Primary Education Project)-IPI (Individually Prescribed Instruction) instructional model in use in Akron has two main objectives: (1) to insure that the child develops the basic physical, perceptual, conceptual and relational abilities that underlie learning in all fields; and (2) to insure that he makes steady progress, at his own rate, toward mastery of academic skills. The Responsive Environment Model in Cleveland is based on convictions that children learn best  when they are interested in what they are doing, that they learn at different rates, and that they learn in different ways. An essential element of the model is the provision of a classroom environment that leads the children into discovering important facts about their social and physical world. Teaching materials foster skills in language, reading, arithmetic, and science. The Engelmann-Becker Model utilized in Dayton is based on programmed teaching materials based on the technology of task analysis, and concentrated on the acquisition of skills in language, reading, and mathematics. The Mathemagenic Activities Model at Martins Ferry focuses on concept development through teaching that incorporates pupil activities that tangibly exemplify the concepts. Supportive services and Parent  Advisory Committee functions are described. (DB)",

Eight Head Start classrooms were used for field testing, six of which used the Tucson Early Education Model curriculum and two of which, for comparison, used local curricula. Procedures involved observing and recording into mutually exclusive activity categories the location of children and adults at two-minute intervals over a thirty-six minute free-choice period. Incidents of inappropriate behavior were also recorded. During the middle twelve minutes, all adults except the observer left the classroom. The procedure demonstrated sensitivity to changes in child behavior during teacher absence. Comparison classrooms had significantly more  incidents of inappropriate behavior during teacher absence than during teacher presence. TEEM classrooms maintained a stable pattern of behavior throughout the observation period. The system was concluded to be extremely useful in assessment of independent learning behavior of children in large groups and should transfer easily to other open classroom settings. (Author/KM)",

Results indicate that prime consideration should be given to the assessment of the preschool child's language status before assuming competency or dominance in any language or deciding to establish a bilingual program.

        "description":"Separation and greeting responses were examined in a longitudinal study of 26 infants, aged 15 to 54 weeks, observed at home. All instances of a person's leaving and entering the room during home visits were observed. The developmental trend--both onset and relative frequency--of each separation behavior was plotted at three-week intervals. The onset of these behaviors was found to be earlier than most other investigators have reported. Following the mother upon her departure and greeting her positively upon her return were found to be more frequent than crying upon separation. Following showed the only sex difference; boys followed more than girls. Crying was more frequent when the infant was left confined rather than free to move about. Separation protest was differential to  the mother from its onset, whereas following was not. Most positive greeting behaviors were differential, but smiling was not, seemingly serving affiliative as well as attachment functions. Infants when left totally alone are more likely to exhibit separation-related behaviors than when left with companions; this finding is interpreted in the light of Bowlby's ethological-evolutionary model of social development.

The high-risk children focused on are those whose developmental lag is frequently not recognized until they fail in school. The two major areas of neurodevelopmental learning disorders are in perceptual-motor development and language development. Specific instruments useful for identifying high-risk children in early childhood are listed. Teacher indicators of deficiencies in both major areas are listed. Before intervention can be successful, teachers must be able to assess developmental levels of motor and language skills. A curriculum model based on concept development is presented. It assumes that perception is the basis  of learning and uses the sensory systems to develop conceptual understandings. A concept, such as apples or sharing, is selected, and the classification and relational concepts related to it are identified. The major areas of conceptual development are properties, position, opposites, quantification, comparisons, associations, time, and motion. Expected outcomes in such areas as auditory and visual perception, reading readiness, gross motor development, and writing are described. References are provided.

        "description":"Four studies were conducted to examine the manner in which cognitively impulsive and reflective children use private speech to control their behaviors. The first study was a naturalistic observation of a group of impulsive (N=8) and reflective (N=8) nursery school children, identified by the Matching Familiar Figures Test. The Impulsive and reflective children differed significantly in the amount and style of verbalizations and in the content and incidence of private or egocentric speech. In a second study the relationship between reflectivity/impulsivity and verbal control of motor behavior was examined with 30 kindergarten children. Under covert self-instructions, impulsive children evidenced significantly less verbal control of inhibitory motor behavior and a greater magnitude  of errors than reflective children. The efficacy of a cognitive self-instructional (SI) training procedure in altering the behavior of &quot;impulsive&quot; school children was examined in two studies. Study III employed an individual training procedure requiring the impulsive child to talk to himself. Results indicated that the SI group (N=5) improved significantly on three measures and retained the improvement after one month. Study IV examined the efficacy of the components of the cognitive treatment procedure in altering the impulsive child's performance on Kagan's measure of cognitive impulsivity. Cognitive modeling slowed down the response time for initial selection, but only with the addition of self-instructional training was there a significant decrease in errors. (Author/KM)",

        "description":"Creative methods of communicating with young children are discussed. In order to communicate through talk, adults must realize that children have a \"secret world\" with their own language and reasoning and must respect it. Self awareness, patience, understanding, and consistency are necessary for adults to truly communicate with children through talk. \"Toy talk\" is useful for reducing adult dominance and approaching the child on his own level. Sociodramatic play gives children practice in interacting with other children and thus improves his ability to communicate verbally. Children often respond more willingly and communicate more easily through singing instead of talking, but adults should not attempt to change songs children create. The Mutual Storytelling Technique is an  effective projective method of communication, enabling children to use one of their favorite modes of communication and adults to introduce new ideas without being coercive. Non-verbal communication--through movement and music-- is also effective with young children. Communication through reading books can be effective--if the appropriate books are chosen, if they are read as though the thing is happening, and if adult dominance is reduced. Children must be free to ask questions. Communicating with the silent child is especially difficult but can be accomplished, perhaps with a non-verbal method. (KM)",

A situational task was chosen in order to gather information about the ongoing open classroom. The Classroom Attitude Observation Schedule was developed to detect pattern shifts in selected process variables in a classroom during the absence of the teacher and other &quot;controlling&quot; adults. The variables are grouping patterns, classroom activities, and inappropriate behaviors. A pilot study of the CAOS was conducted, using six experimental (TEEM) classrooms and two comparison classrooms. The summary dependent variables were mean group size, mean number of children engaged in an  activity, inappropriate behavior, mean number of groups, mean number of activities. The summary activity categories were traditional academic activities, nontraditional cognitive learning activities, play and role playing, snacks and management, and nonfocused activities. Results showed the CAOS sensitive to pattern shifts. The clearest shift appeared with levels of inappropriate behavior. Children in comparison classrooms displayed more inappropriate behavior during teacher absence than did children in the TEEM classrooms. There were significant differences between teacher absence and teacher presence in Comparison classrooms but not in TEEM classrooms. The size of groups in which children clustered themselves changed significantly when the teacher was not present. (KM)",

The S received a star for each two minutes (later, each minute) of appropriate study behavior. She could later exchange the stars for prizes and/or privileges that she valued.

In these processes the child conjoins and contrasts recurrent segments--perhaps a recurrent word--of the messages presented to him. After repeated exposure to messages containing a common segment, the child recognizes the invariant segment. Both the identification of meanings and the formation of classes can be explained on this basis. In the first section, language acquisition is discussed as an unadulterated process of activities with little consideration for the products and structures generated. Linguistic operations are compared with those in economy through the comparison of three stages in the development of monetary systems--the barter  system, the coinage system and the debenture system--with three stages in the origin, development and study of language--the proto-language, the token language, and the interaction language. It is argued that the intellectual processes involved are roughly comparable to Piaget's three stages of cognitive development--the periods of sensory-motor activity, concrete operations and formal operations. In the second section, the acquisition of the semantic and syntactic organization of language is emphasized. All these acquisitions succeed through active operations by the child with and upon the relational information given. These operations consist of intersecting or composing, conjoining or aligning relational information. (Author/KM)",

Additional data were collected from the classes of teachers in the area who were teaching the program for the second or third year. Results indicated significantly greater conceptual skills achievement by students exposed to the  program. The second component, a student attitude measure, estimated the relative performance of children for Conceptual Skills and seven other in-and-out-of-school activities. Data were collected from all children receiving the program, which necessitated devising a group-administered attitude test for children unable to read or write. Students ranked the Conceptual Skills Program lowest. Opinion data from parents, the third component, were also collected, using an interview-questionnaire technique for a random sample of parents. Generally, parents were well informed about the program and approved of it. Ten teachers were observed and evaluated in their use of the program. (Author/KM)",

A discrimination task, consisting of two schematic drawings of faces cut from varying shades of brown (Caucasian), pink-tan (Negro) and green (control), and a doll choice task, using two black and two white dolls (one of each sex) were administered to 192 integrated nursery schools and public kindergartens. They were equally divided as to age, sex, and race (black or white). The younger group averaged 3 years 11 months and the older group 5 years and 2 months. Each subject was tested individually; half of each group was tested by a white examiner and half by a black examiner. An analysis of variance  was carried out on the scores obtained on both tasks. Results showed that the prediction that children would have more difficulty learning to differentiate faces of another race was confirmed with both black and white children. The pattern of the results on both tasks indicated that responses based upon racial cues are already quite complex in three-year-old children. On the discrimination learning task, black children learned more quickly, and the performance of younger children was enhanced when tested by an examiner of another race. When the lighter member of the pair was reinforced in the discrimination learning task, all children learned more easily.

        "description":"The study assessed contributions of different novelty pairings and reward types to exploration behavior across three successive discrimination learning problems in a 3 x 2 x 3 mixed design. After learning a simple two choice discrimination problem, Headstart subjects responded to six double reward trials and six extinction trials. A learning-to-learn effect occurred with regard to both problem solution and decision time. Epistemic curiosity was evident across problems to the extent that children would explore a novel object even after learning that the familiar object was associated with reward. Reward type did not affect response selection but did increase response latency on initial double reward trials. (Author)",

The most important result was that black subjects held back affective words in free recall significantly more than white subjects. No contextual effect of the race of experimenter was found.

These issues concern: (1) the criteria by which the separate levels, or structures, or stages of psychological development are to be identified; (2) the principle by means of which these configurations are to be ordered; (3) the nature of the transitions taking place between developmental landmarks, stages, or states; and (4) the nature of the processes within the individual and between the individual and his circumstances which account for the transformations from one stage or state to another. Criteria used in producing six ordinal scales of sensorimotor development were: (1) ease of elicitation, (2) observer agreement, and (3) theoretical meaningfulness. Sequential organization of behavioral landmarks must come  from longitudinal studies of infants examined repeatedly during their development; inevitable sequentiality calls for longitudinal studies of infants developing under as wide a variety of cultures and conditions as feasible. Behavioral landmarks imply any of several forms of transformation. The characteristics of the transformations between successive levels or states are implicit in the nature of the differences between the characteristics of the observable behavioral landmarks of successive levels. Cross-sectional data derived from children developing under three differing sets of rearing conditions and data from two longitudinal studies are provided, which indicate great variation in the ages at which infants and young children achieve the various levels of object construction which  are correlated with their environmental circumstances.

        "author":["Levine, Jacob"],
        "description":"The smiles and laughter of an infant form the beginning of the developmental process of interpersonal interaction and socialization. The earliest smiles are automatic expressions of internal states, but soon infants' smiles are communications of pleasure. The developmental changes in smiling and laughing in early infancy reflect the rapidity with which these emotional responses become important elements in the interactions between the infant and his social environment. The importance of smiling and laughter is demonstrated by clinical observations of their absence; distressed or frightened infants do not smile or laugh. Recent investigations point to humor as an essential component of the normal growth process. Humor provides the individual with the opportunity to re-experience  the gratifications of cognitive and interpersonal mastery. An important determinant of children's humor responses is the degree to which the humor requires them to use their cognitive abilities maximally. Humor is conceptualized here as a reassertion of one's competence and its antithesis, anxiety, as a painful state of helplessness. Humor is frequently used to dispell anxiety; by secondary reinforcement humor becomes a learned motive to experience mastery in the face of anxiety--the \"whistling in the dark\" phenomenon. Humor development parallels the stages of cognitive and psychosocial development. Humor is used to circumvent prohibitions, express aggression indirectly, and can be used to facilitate learning.

        "description":"A study was conducted during the 1964-65 school year to determine the kinds of social adaptation made by inner-city black children who were bused to two middle-class, predominantly white elementary schools and by white students new to the same schools. Two-way social adjustment ratings (from students and teachers) were obtained on about half of the black students and about 3/4 of the white students. Results showed that a majority of the children, black and white, adjusted well to their new school. A discrepancy existed between the opinions of teachers and students about their adjustment; teachers tended to rate white students as well adjusted more frequently than they themselves did and black students as poorly adjusted more frequently than they themselves did. It is considered  that this tendency on the part of the white teachers may result from a persistence of racial myths and social Darwinism. It is also suggested that, considering the weight a teacher's opinion carries, the maladaptations which are said to exist among some low-income minority group students may be a self-fulfilling prophecy.

        "description":"The popular view among American psychologists has been that there is a continuity of psychological structure that is shaped by early experience. Data gathered in studies of Guatemalan villages imply serious discontinuities in the development of particular cognitive competencies and capacities for affect through preadolescence. The first two years of life are not a good predictor of future functioning in all environmental contexts. Separate maturational factors seem to set the time of emergence of basic cognitive functions, although experience can slow or speed up that emergence to a degree. In the Guatemalan villages observed, infants are permitted very little activity in the first 15 months, are not allowed outside, have little to play with, and are seldom played with. These  infants exhibit extreme motoric passivity, but they develop normally in childhood. Identical procedures involving color and movement were administered to American and Guatemalan infants. Guatemalan infants were significantly less attentive than the Americans, and Americans had longer fixation times. To test the reversibility of the apparent slowing of cognitive growth in the Guatemalan child, cognitive tests were administered to rural and urban middle-class and economically disadvantaged preadolescents. Their performance on tests of perceptual analysis, perceptual inference, recall and recognition memory was comparable to American middle-class norms. Certain data suggest that economically disadvantaged American and Guatemalan children aged 5-9 are from one to three years behind  middle-class children in demonstrating some cognitive skills but that these competencies emerge by age 10 or 11.

Implementation of an integrated career education program is described in terms of the administrative plan, curriculum development, instructional development teams, pupil personnel services, the school organizations and activities program, placement services, staff development, community involvement, advisory committees, and evaluation. Three levels of career education programs are discussed: (1) the program designed for  the elementary school, which should be developmental; (2) the junior high school program, which is basically explorative; and (3) the high school program, which is built upon the cumulative experiences of the student and which provides opportunities for investigating careers in depth.

The coding of raw data was modified to allow for sensitive analysis of possible disparities among students of different ethnic groups. The coding was done by 5 observers who spent 45 minutes in the 4th grade classes and the entire period in the other classes.

Birth and death rates, rural and urban residence, population by race, and age structure are discussed under the heading of United States and Iowa Population Trends. Rural-urban trends and migration are discussed under the headings of Area Population Trends and County Population Trends. It was found that population growth has remained steady and that out-migration has declined in Iowa between 1960 and 1970. Significant shifts have occurred in the number and proportion of people living in rural and urban areas--the rural population has  continued steadily to decline, while the trend toward urbanization has continued. The Black population (1.2% of the total population) has increased more than 7,000, up about 28% from 1960. American Indians, Japanese, Chinese, and other races increased from nearly 3,500 in 1960 to slightly over 9,000 in 1970. The findings also indicated that, during the 1960s, Iowa's birth rate has declined and its death rate has increased and that the 65 and over age group increased by nearly 22,500, an increase of from 11.9% to 12.4% since 1960.

The specific objectives were to define a social system model, a social power model, and the methodology used for the delineation of persons perceived to be power actors; to determine the extent to which the power actors were perceived to have social power in different issue areas in 5 communities; and to generate some suggestions and implications. The procedures for identifying the power actors involved 3 phases: (1) external community knowledgeables were interviewed, (2) internal community knowledgeables were interviewed, and (3) 92 power actors were interviewed with a formal field schedule. Major findings were that empirical data did not support the  general hypothesis that power structures will vary by issue area and that the data tended to support the hypothesis that community power structures were more polymorphic as the size of the community increased. Twelve suggestions for social scientists doing future power structure research were included, along with 7 implications for change agents. (PS)",

Four variables--level of occupational aspiration, level of educational aspiration, socioeconomic status, and intelligence--were measured for 1,844 students and 408 dropouts. Major findings were that the best predictor of both aspirational variables was past academic performance followed by measured intelligence, that there were strong relationships between staying in school and  levels of occupational and educational aspirations, that a close relationship existed between staying in school and the ability of the individual respondents as indicated by both measured intelligence and past academic performance, and that substantial relationships were revealed between staying in school and a variety of family characteristics. An analysis of the data was presented in tabular form. (PS)",

The evaluation was conducted during March 27-30, 1973. The 6 American Indian participants, who are financially supported by the Bureau of Indian Affairs' (BIA) Higher Education Program, and 3 prospective students were interviewed, as were the center's core staff personnel and the Vista workers. The 4-day assessment period culminated with a visit to the BIA Office in Muskogee, Oklahoma, to assess their conception of the program. The assessment placed emphasis on the testimonies of the students, who articulated the program's effectiveness. Success of the program was noticeable by the advancement made by 3 students  who were near graduation. Findings included that there was a need to clarify the UWW goals and objectives in a language understandable to a layman and that the communications network between UWW and the BIA Higher Education Office in Muskogee needed improvement. It was recommended that BIA assistance will be vitally needed in the future should UWW prove to be a viable alternative educational program for Indian people. Included in the appendixes are (1) the fiscal year budget, 1973; (2) the fiscal year budget, 1974; (3) the \"Cluster Concept\" proposal for expansion; (4) the admission requirements; and (5) a list of institutions participating in the UWW consortium.

Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, was chosen because of its location in a low-income rural area with relatively high outmigration, a declining agricultural industry base, and few employment opportunities. All of the data relating to Government spending at the Fort were obtained through various personnel at Fort Wood, with the Comptroller's office furnishing the majority of the data. A mail questionnaire was used to determine commuting patterns of civilian employees. From a total of 362 persons chosen at random from mailing lists of employees supplied by the data processing office at Fort Wood, 190 completed questionnaires were returned. Specific topics discussed were the economy of the  area; the population migration in Laclede, Miller, Phelps, Pulaski, and Texas counties; the military payroll, the civilian payroll, impacted area funds, and the retail sales taxes at Fort Wood; and the employment multiplier. Specific conclusions were discussed under each topic heading. (HBC)",

The purpose of this report was to make an informal assessment of development progress on the reservation as a result of the program, giving particular attention to assessment of the first new small industrial project that had been attracted to the reservation. A description of the reservation was presented in terms of geography, education, housing, health care, employment, population, and community development. The progress and potential for development of the reservation was described, and information on the new  industry was presented. Major findings were that the reservation Indians can and are willing to become industrial workers, that the success of the industry project was owing to the fact that it was a &quot;self-reservation&quot; project, that local resource cooperation was essential, that manager-employee relations were important, that the autonomous development corporation idea is better than working through the tribal council, that a democratic group process does not work well with the McDermitt Indians, and that it takes time and patience to start a new industry. Further plans, hopes, and suggestions were also presented. (PS)",

The first chapter, &quot;What Is Rural America?&quot; focuses on 3 aspects of the rural problem: (1) the problem of definition, (2) the rural population distribution, and (3) the extreme poverty faced by many rural dwellers. Chapter 2 is a study of the distribution of Federal outlays within the U.S. in 1970. It is concluded that rural people do not share proportionately in the distribution of Federal programs, that outlays for defense favor the larger and higher income urban areas, that Federal programs are failing to meet the county's development needs, and that Federal outlays for agriculture and national resources are  concentrated in non-metropolitan counties having pronounced population declines and high per capita income. The National Advisory Committee On Rural Poverty is discussed in Chapter 3. The commission's tasks were to make a comprehensive study of American rural life; to evaluate existing programs; and to develop recommendations for action by local, state, or Federal governments or private enterprise. Chapter 4 contains tables which further document the short changing of rural people and communities in the distribution of Federal programs. Metropolitan status and urban orientation are the major groupings used in the tables. (HBC)",

The sample consisted of 61 Mexican American children attending a monolingual school and 59 Mexican American children attending a bilingual school. The children were shown a silent movie and then asked to tell the story. Their answers were recorded on tape and transcribed. The deviations from standard English were described and categorized into errors in morphology, syntax,  and vocabulary and counted as to their relative frequency in order to determine differences due to such independent variables as grade, sex, and type of schooling. Comparisons of frequency were based on comparisons made as to correct usage percentage within the 2 most frequent error categories and overall comparisons of all error frequency made as to number of errors per number of words. Major findings were (1) that deviations apparently were the result of the expected Spanish interference, the improper application of standard English rules, and the influence of nonstandard English dialects and (2) that children in the bilingual school did not differ significantly from those in the monolingual school with respect to frequency of deviations from standard English.

Classrooms were observed in 52 rural, urban, and suburban schools in California, New Mexico, and Texas with a substantial enrollment of Mexican American students. Data from 429 English and social studies classrooms in grades 4, 8, 10, and 12 were analyzed using the Flanders Interaction Analysis system to code teacher-pupil interactions and 22 school, classroom, and teacher characteristics. The differences in the way the teacher interacted with students were measured by the disparities in the Anglo and Mexican American per pupil measures which were calculated for each type of behavior. The coding  of the classroom interaction was done every 3 seconds for 10 minutes in each classroom by 5 observers. The observers also coded observed teacher and classroom characteristics, briefly interviewed the teacher, and made a seating chart of the location of each chair and the ethnicity of each occupant while in the classroom. Data were also collected as to whether each observed classroom was tracked and to what degree. Significant differences were found between Mexican American and Anglo students in terms of teacher praise or encouragement, acceptance or use of student ideas, questioning, positive response, all noncriticizing talk, and all student speaking.

Some major areas covered in the interviews were farm policy, political tactics, strikes by farm workers, and the family farm.

In 1957, all the juniors and seniors enrolled in the county's 6 school districts responded to questionnaires which sought to explore several aspects of their situations near the end of high school. Factors examined included the students' opinions of the community, possible expectations to migrate, plans for further training or education, and expectations for entry into the work force. Students who participated in the original study were relocated in 1968, and information was sought on their experience in the intervening period. The restudy questionnaire covered events such as marriage and family formation, further education or training completed, military  service, migration and residence, and occupational experiences. Findings from the 1968 study were that a majority of the subjects did move away from their home communities, that a little over one-half of the males and a few females served in the armed forces, that the subjects were dispersed throughout the occupational structure, that occupational achievement was related to residence, that many of the young people had married during the decade, and that most thought that it was necessary for young people to leave the area after high school to pursue desirable career objectives.

The educational objective which needed to be measured was whether &quot;the children are taught the history and cultural heritage which reflect the value systems of speakers of both languages.&quot; The Elementary and Secondary Act, Title VII project sites chosen for testing included the Artesia, New Mexico; the Alice, Texas; and the Los Nietos and Collier County, California, project sites. Data for item analysis were collected through the testing of 313 primary grade children. Graphic symbols of the Anglo and Mexican American cultures were employed in the Inventory, which was  constructed to evaluate attitude. The results indicated that the Inventory may be assumed to provide a gross measure of acculturation suitable for use with groups. The mean score for the Mexican American culture subtest was significantly lower than the score for the Anglo-culture subtest. Among the Mexican items, the Mexican flag, the Spanish word &quot;si,&quot; the pinata, the bowl of menudo, and the Mexican hat possessed the highest item-test correlation. Among the United States items, the American flag, the cowboy hat, the piece of bread, and the pickle possessed the highest item-test correlations. (Author/HBC)",

Those married to Mexican Americans but not one themselves, Latin Americans, and those not native-born white Americans were excluded.  Interviews were conducted shortly after the applicant applied for vocational rehabilitation services and every 6 months thereafter for one year. The interviews were tape recorded. Analyzed statistically were 1,250 items which included the responses to the interview questions; data obtained from the Arizona Division of Vocational Rehabilitation; the results of an analysis of differences in goals, treatment, and attitudes; and the findings on lost cases. Some of the findings were (1) that there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in outcome in rehabilitation and (2) that no significant difference in status between the 2 groups existed at the completion of the rehabilitation process.

Data on the 157 children in the sample were obtained through parent interviews, testing measures of academic achievement, and several measures of IQ and academic aptitude, teacher ratings, school records, and a measure of the child's self-concept via a projective device. Conventional behavior (CB); functional information, knowledge, and skill (FI); esoteric information (EI); and abstract reasoning and problem solving (AR) were isolated as principal constructs. It was concluded (1) that AR, FI, and CB were related to academic performance; (2) that the existing psychometric  instruments do not provide an adequate measure of any of the 3 relevant factors and, in fact, are badly contaminated by factors which are irrelevant to school performance and negatively related to socioeconomic status; (3) that teachers' ratings of performance and potential are influenced by factors irrelevant to actual academic proficiency; and (4) that there is an urgent need for better definition and measurement of the 3 primary factors related to achievement, and to a study of their effects over the school years. Additionally, a model for academic achievement was discussed which could be utilized as a research guide. (HBC)",

The planning is done by a representative body with the authority to make detailed studies, to draft and recommend long-range comprehensive plans and specific plans, and to suggest measures to implement the plans. The 3 steps for preparing a comprehensive plan are (1) deciding on overall goals; (2) gathering facts about what the county has now, its resources, potentials, and problems; and (3) making a comprehensive plan that shows how the county can use what it has to achieve its goals. To put the plan into effect requires adoption of the plan by the county governing body, an action program directed by the county government, cooperation of private developers, and  public support.

        "description":"Among young American Indians, a radical social movement has been evolving, as has a common ideology, because historical and social conditions have unified tribes in an awareness of a common identity and a common set of problems. A key tenet of this ideology has been a challenge to the legitimacy of the social sciences. This aspect of the movement was brought to the attention of a group of applied anthropologists at a workshop on Indian education. At the workshop, militant Indians charged that the scientific knowledge of the anthropologists was not pertinent to Indians and that the motives of anthropologists have been based upon exploitation of the Indian people. The paper presented 2 models for interaction between anthropologists and their subjects which were implied in the  responses to a questionnaire sent to the anthropologists involved in the workshop. The respondents preferred the first model, which is based upon a professional/client relationship. In this model, the anthropologist's role is to apply his knowledge and skill in the research of social problems as defined by a community, and his goal is to provide solutions for these problems. As applied anthropology is now known, the problems investigated are usually defined by an innovative organization committed to the goals of modernization, development, and modification of human behavior. However, it is apparent that some anthropological research projects have fostered misunderstanding. The episode at the workshop pointed out that anthropology has frequently promised more than it has been able to  deliver. (FF)",

The purpose of this paper was to lend insight into this question by examining the differences in the attitudes and values of American Indians and non-Indians attending a large western university. The premise upon which the authors based their observations was that there was no significant difference between Indians and non-Indians in the value they placed on education, their problems in school, their grade-point averages, their reported absences, and their feelings about racial discrimination. A survey was distributed at random to 110 students from a large, private western university, a university with one of the nation's leading Indian education programs,  in order to determine the validity of the authors' premise. The attitude survey indicated that Indians tended to value their education more than non-Indians do, that Indian students were still aware of their background, and that their ties to their home culture were still great. It was concluded that successful Indian students had not become completely white oriented. Results of the survey are presented in the form of percentages in 3 tables--Population Description, Indian and Non-Indian Comparison, and Conditions Affecting Academic Standing. (FF)",

A concern of the Indian is that most Federal employees have misconceptions about Indians that often result in well-motivated but poorly conceived programs. Facts refuting some of the more commonly held misconceptions are listed and discussed. They are (1) that Indians are not all alike; (2) that not all Indians live on reservations; (3) that Indians are different from other ethnic minorities; (4) that the Indian is caught in a cultural crisis; (5) that there is no  such thing as Indian education; and (6) that there are Indian cultural similarities. &quot;Real Indian Education&quot; and &quot;Variations on the Theme of Responsibility&quot; are additional topics of discussion. It is concluded that any attempt at increasing the services of HEW to the Native American must be federal, consistent in every state, adequately funded, and Indian conceived and controlled. Also, it is imperative that this design allow an Indian child to remain Indian and still be biculturally educated for the economic and social existence that he determines. Both reservation and non-reservation Indians must be accommodated by this design. (HBC)",

Education is supposed to teach the Indian respect for law and order while he watches the law being violated before his eyes. The Indian is taught to revere knowledge while he watches incompetents achieve the most startling success. He is taught to expect an equal opportunity while he knows that he will be denied that opportunity because of his race. If Indian education is to succeed in the tribal setting, the communities must become, as they were in the past, the producers of education. The way to initiate this change is to work on the content  of education and not on the techniques and procedures of education. The study of tribal customs must be initiated, and they must be taught in school on an equal basis with other academic subjects. Indians must have basic courses in reading, writing, and arithmetic to serve as tools for the real educational experience of learning the traditions, customs, and beliefs of the tribal community. That communities produce educational experiences, educational training does not produce communities is a basic thesis to which the community colleges are making a significant contribution by providing centers for an ongoing cultural life.

Their purpose is to point up significant current problems in those areas and to suggest effective research approaches to their solution. This issue, dealing with changes taking place in our schools and total educational system, presents six major essays. The first, \"New Schools for New Times,\" explores designing schools that are responsive to changing demands and focuses on improving student performance. The need for clearly defining what schools want to accomplish is discussed in \"Bringing Management by Objectives to Schools.\"\"The Curriculum: Make It Relevant!, Make It Work!\" demands the formalizing of precise objectives and  instructional goals as a basis for better curricula. The prototype of a practical system for teacher appraisal is spelled out in \"Appraising Teacher Performance,\" while the adoption of a planning--programming--budgeting system is called for in \"PPBS: Planning for Schools of the Future.\" The final article, \"A Better School/Community Dialogue,\" looks closely at the communication programs of educators who are confronted by the public's growing disenchantment and concern with school practices and expenditures.

Thirty concepts, ten for each of the biological, earth, and physical science areas, were selected from six fourth grade texts and analyzed in terms of the level to which concepts, attributes, and examples were identified. A 12-item test was constructed for each concept. Statistical results from concept and task attainments for boys and girls indicated the highest attainment level on biological concepts, the lowest level in physical science, and subtle differences in the performance of girls and boys. Results from a further simplex analysis of the task  attainment scores supported the postulation of a concept attainment hierarchy. Children responded well on tasks dealing with gross perceptions rather than fine distinctions among examples and non-examples of a concept with the gross perception level preferred to the fine perception level. The attainment of a concept was a function of its association with the concrete world. Reexamination of science curriculum, instructional procedures, and children's cognitive abilities in terms of concept learning was recommended. (CC)",

Secondary purposes were to examine the degree to which a pretest, grade level, and sex of the student influenced the amount learned. The three concepts were analyzed to determine their relevant and irrelevant attributes. Examples and nonexamples of each concept were also selected. On the basis of these analyses a 5 1/2 page lesson was written. Information given in the lesson for each concept included a definition in terms of the relevant attributes of the concept, and both examples and nonexamples of the concept. A 12-item testing  instrument was also developed. The basic design was a Solomon Four-Group Design with pretest and lesson as factors. The design was replicated at two grade levels, fourth and sixth, and sex of the student was also included as a factor. Concluding statements indicate that both fourth- and sixth-grade students gained information about the concepts by studying a short written lesson and retained a significant amount of that information for a three-month period. The reading lesson and tests are included. (Author/BL)",

In Experiment I, the effect of presenting a rationally chosen set of positive and negative instances was contrasted with the effect of presenting either a rationally chosen set of positive instances alone or two randomly selected positive instances. Experiment II modified the treatment by giving a concept definition in addition to teaching instances. In Experiment III the effect of presenting a rationally chosen set of positive and negative instances alone was compared with the effect of also including either a concept definition alone or a concept definition plus emphasis of relevant attributes. About 100 sixth grade students took a series of printed lessons dealing  with geometric symmetry. Results showed that providing a rational set of positive and negative instances with a definition, or with a definition plus emphasis, was significantly more facilitative in promoting concept learning than the rational set alone, and that providing a rational set of instances with a definition and emphasis was not sifnificantly more facilitative than the rational set with definition alone.

Thirty-eight kindergarten and first grade teachers participated. The success of the inservice program was judged by comparing the teachers' performance on 24 objectives with performance criteria based on the results of an assessment of the behaviors of successful experienced DMP teachers. Results showed that the teachers exceeded the criterion levels on 13 of the objectives; it was found also that teacher performance did not seem to be related to teacher characteristics such as age, experience, or professional activities. Behaviors for which  teachers did not reach criterion levels included asking probing questions, describing the mathematical processes emphasized by DMP, and managing instruction to provide for individual differences. Seventy-six percent of the teachers were judged to have done an adequate job of implementing an activity approach. (Author/DT)",

Results showed a statistical difference in the area of concepts, favoring the group taught the Related Facts Method. No  statistical differences were found in the areas of computation, problem-solving, or addition and subtraction of integers. The second study involved 90 students and two teachers, and compared the Complement Method of subtraction to the Systems Method. Statistical difference on the retention of the subtraction of integers favored the Systems Method. Statistical difference on the retention of the addition of integers favored the Complement Method.

Osgood's semantic differential, Rotter internal-external locus of control scale, the Edwards personal preference schedule achievement scale, the achievement anxiety test, and an  engineering function questionnaire were used as instruments. Practicing engineers answered the same questionnaire to ascertain differences in their operational procedures. Significant differences were noted in perception of the importance of communications as compared to mathematics and science and in such concepts as &quot;engineer,&quot;&quot;future goal,&quot; and &quot;change.&quot; The remaining variables manifested changes in the preferred direction.

A foundation for the study is achieved through discussion of the socialization processes as they are affected by education and economic growth. It is suggested that the societal system determines motivation and values which in turn cause and determine the behaviors of individuals in the society. Problems affecting the development of achievement motivation in developing nations are noted and several existing programs in motivational development work are discussed. Knowledge of value systems, socialization practices, and economic factors in developing countries is seen as being necessary to the understanding of the concept of motivational achievement. Development in new nations, a process of  trying to modernize societies while developing more creative individuals, is a matter relevant to education and resocialization practices. (Author/SHM)",

In this progress report (see ED 066 351), the second year's work is outlined. Four teachers each designed a unit of study which are presented here, stating objectives, content, and activities. Unit 1, Nuclear Group Interdependence, is a study of the family (the student's own and those from various cultures); Unit 2, Neighborhood Interdependence, is an identification of the way of living in a local neighborhood in relationship to the way of living throughout the city; Unit 3, Interdependence in Urban Communities, examines the interdependence of all groups of people in a city in creating one productive unit; and Unit 4, Regional  Interdependence, studies the relationship of cities and rural areas and their creation of one productive Canadian society. The personnel, time schedules, work assignments, and contributions are reported in Section 3, along with acknowledgement of contributions from and consultations with outside sources. The advantages of teacher involvement in curriculum development is cited. Year III plans call for pilot programs, continuous evaluation, involvement of additional teachers, and the production of a teacher's manual. (JMB)",

The aim of the developers is to design a structured outline for the four week visit, covering transportation, housing, the examination of the life styles, the industries, the people, and the total environment. Extensive use is made of cameras, tape recorders, and video equipment. A teachers manual is being prepared to facilitate preparation of such a study, including instruction in the use of the equipment by students, as is a multimedia kit, intended for use by  schools unable to send students for site visits. Student evaluation of the trips, both of the planning and organization, and of the actual community study, is a major factor, currently revealing effectiveness of the project and the extent of observation and awareness developing on the part of the student.

        "description":"The meaning of objectives in geographic education and the need to structure objectives in some hierarchical manner are presented in this paper. Discussion in past years centered on the teaching of general objectives in geography classes. During the last twenty years, however, geography instructors realized that objectives may be at various levels of generality or specificity and this led to a focus on behavioral objectives. Bloom's Taxonomy was used in an attempt to structure the objectives of geography teaching into a hierarchy from the point of view of the intellectual abilities required to achieve these objectives. However, such a hierarchy is incomplete if examined from the point of view of a teacher attempting to structure a geography course. This hierarchy structure  disregards the idea that concepts of widely differing intellectual levels may be involved, ignoring the data of a relationship between concepts and levels of operation. It is suggested that a logical structure exists in which more complex concepts are based on an infrastructure of simpler ones. Therefore the development of a geography course could depend on a close analysis of the logical structure of concepts and principles inherent in the topics taught, and on their careful arrangement as a series of hierarchial performance or behavioral objectives.

The condition of cities in America today is examined for the purpose of understanding the causes of their present condition and the steps that can be taken to save them. The goal of the course is to make students aware of urban development and problems in order that they may better understand and intelligently deal with the urban complexities. Learning activities are designed to guide the student toward an understanding of why and how cities develop and grow, the examination of problems that develop in large cities, and an understanding of the need for city planning and urban renewal. A special project, the design of  plans for future cities, is suggested as the culminating unit activity. A student/teacher bibliography includes textual and audiovisual materials to support the study of changing cities. (Author/SHM)",

Emphasis is placed on description and evaluation of the ways in which social conflict associated with racial, economic, political, and ecological policies are presented to the young reader. Evaluative assertion analysis, a content analysis research technique, is used to extract from a message the evaluations being made of significant concepts. This technique is briefly described and the author illustrates the assumptions  involved in the application of evaluative assertation analysis. (Author/SHM)",

New approaches in the area of teacher education are designed to meet these current demands in the schools: demands for teachers to have curriculum orientations which cross traditional curriculum boundaries; demands for teachers to be aware of and to deal constructively with student affect; demands for new patterns of staffing and resource utilization. The model itself consists of three components: Phase I, Continuous Professional Education Programs (pre-doctoral); Phase II, Doctoral Programs; and Phase III, Research and Development Programs. Each deals with a particular domain of activity related to teacher education and each intersects with  the other two components, suggesting an integrated and unified teacher education effort. Emphasis in the programs to be developed will be toward diversity and the development and testing of strategies, approaches and technologies relevant to the training of teachers. Examples of programs which are particularly appropriate for prospective teachers of the social studies are given. (SHM)",

        "description":"Four interrelated questions in this paper provide a framework for examining the rationale of a model for developing a political laboratory which would fulfill meaningful objectives for civics and government instruction. The first question, why make the school the focus of the laboratory, offers reasons for preferring the school over the classroom or community as a setting for political activity. Discussion of the second question--why stress political participation--gives theories of learning and instruction and of political participation and its effects on the political system. The third question deals with how politics can be taught via the laboratory and focuses on providing a framework for viewing school politics. The last question explains ways in which knowledge building,  skill building, and participation activities can be designed. The lab can transform the image of the school into a dynamic social and political unit, and can help students transfer knowledge directly into a practical political situation.

Attention is given to the administrative problems which are likely to occur with rapid and significant changes such as those envisioned here. Readings are cited for student discovery and development. Part Two details several strategies and teaching-learning techniques advocated by leading social studies specialists. These strategies may be applied--sometimes with modifications--to nearly all the social studies  areas and at most grade levels. Part Three illustrates techniques which apply specifically to several of the major fields of study. Part Four offers examples of the interdisciplinary approach, and Part Five demonstrates how all the disciplines and resources of the social studies may be brought to bear on significant social problems in order to effect social change.

The four major areas of concern were: 1) Cognitive Knowledge About Africa (including the dispelling of prevalent myths), 2) Teacher Attitudes Toward Change and Change Agents in the Social Studies Curriculum, 3) Teaching Methods and Techniques and, 4) Teaching Materials and Teacher Evaluation of Materials. A questionnaire reflecting these major areas was administered to teachers who had attended the two types of workshops - regional meetings and &quot;week-long&quot; intensive workshops. It was found that the project was successful in all four major areas and that both attitude and knowledge increased with  exposure to the AAI training. Cooperation among agencies and local school units was found beneficial. A philosophy of curriculum change which considers the teacher as a decision-maker was found effective and the training was judged efficient. The test and questionnaire items are reprinted within the report and its appendices. (Author)",

Concerned with the contemporary condition of human society rather than the historical evolution of the third world, this unit deals with the process of rural social change and the interaction of technology, society, and culture. A major objective of the comparative approach used is to reveal not only change, illustrating that innovative ideas and practices have penetrated developing countries, but also to present visual data illustrating how the quality of life has improved for the majority of villagers. An innovative approach combines a contrasting study of visual materials. Pictures were taken from Kishan Garhi showing evidence of  change between the anthropologist's two visits -- the first in 1951, and the latter in 1968. The major portion of the document provides a list of slides along with interpretations on changes in technology, society, and culture; women's roles; castes and occupations; agricultural operations; and village architecture. In addition, a brief introduction to the project and to the slides is given, and a list of slides and published materials included.

        "description":"The major portion of the essay explores the psychological aspects of war within man and is followed by six different commentaries on Dr. Fromm's work. Divided into three parts, the essay first examines the nature of man to determine the goodness vs. evilness of man. Two basic personality types are identified: The necrophile, a destruction, perverted personality attraced to death: and the biophile, an optimistic personality attracted to life. It is hypothesized that the necrophile is a secondary potentiality -- a perversion occurring when the primary, life-favoring potentialities are thwarted or fail to develop. The essay examines and compares in detail characteristics of necrophilous and biophilous persons. In addition, a comparison is made between the two orientations and  Freud's concept of the life instinct (Eros) and the death instinct. Society fosters the biophilic personality type when the individual is surrounded by people who love life and when security, justice, and freedom exist. The last part of the essay deals with implications of these personality theories in regard to the nuclear age where the emphasis in life in all modern industrial society is upon mechanical means, tending to promote the necrophilous attraction to death, war, and destruction. Commentaries on the essay are made by Jerome Frank, Paul Tillich, Hans Morgenthau, Roy Menninger, Pitirim Sorokin, and Thomas Merton. (SJM)",

The first part describes games and simulation; and factors that should be considered in selecting, using, and debriefing games in the classroom. Exercises to test understanding of this section are included. The second section, points out how role playing is used in training children in rational problem solving, and the steps involved in this strategy. Short learning activities are also included for this section. Behavioral objectives in this module are that the teacher-trainee will be able to: utilize role playing techniques in lessons; write definitions of the concepts \"game\", \"simulation\", and\"simulation game\"; critique a simulation game; and reorder a set of scrambled steps employed in the strategy of role playing to illustrate the correct sequence.

The student will also be taught to compose teacher questions that reflect the level of thinking desired of pupils and that clearly define for the pupils the \"thinking\" behavior(s) they are able to exhibit. The first part of this module outlines information and activities designed to develop critical thinking competencies embodied in the listed behavioral objectives. The second part offers information and activities dealing with classifying and writing instructional cognitive objectives focusing on  the thinking process. Classifications of thinking as categorized by Bloom and his associates place knowledge at the base of a pyramid representing the least complex behavior, then comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation in an ascending order. Principles, descriptions, sample behavioral objectives, and activities for the six categories of Bloom are provided. Related documents are SO 005 443 through SO 005 448, and SO 005 450.

Pupils learn something about economics as a social science and the role of economists in helping people solve economic problems. They examine steps in problem solving and learn to distinguish between questions asking for explanation and prediction from those asking for normative or value decisions. The unit calls for a study of the concept of scarcity, and introduces pupils to some of the key questions which arise out of scarcity--what and how much should be produced; how it should be produced; how goods and services should be divided among people. Some time is spent considering ways in which economic goals differ in different societies and among different groups within American  society. Objectives, content, teaching procedures, learning activities, and materials are outlined. Some of the broad skills toward which teaching is aimed are that the student: attacks problems in a rational manner; locates, gathers, organizes and analyzes information and draws conclusions; develops attitudes of skepticism toward conventional truths, and values objectivity in interpretation of evidence.

        "description":"This study proposed to determine how 5th grade students' political orientations result from such social characteristics as their sex, age, socio-economic status and race, and secondly, how student political orientations are influenced by the organization of their school. Emphasis was upon examining the organizational climate in an effort to see if this climate reinforces a belief that these children are merely passive subjects, or if they are active participants in the American political system. One thousand twenty seven fifth-grade students from low socio-economic status elementary schools in urban districts filled out a civic education questionnaire which measured their orientation toward aspects of the American political system, political knowledge, and political behavior. Two  hundred sixty-five teachers completed the Organizational Climate Description Questionnaire (OCDQ). Control was introduced for the influence of student and teacher, sex, the race of interviewers and students, socio-economic status, and age of student. Findings indicate that the elementary school organizational climate has less relationship to student political behavior and orientations than the school's racial composition. The climate factors Leadership Initiation and Source of Social Cohesion were shown to relate to a teacher role model, and Sense of Organizational Attachment and Administrative Structure to a school role model.

        "description":"The first part of the paper briefly reviews the teaching of area studies within the last generation, noting that Chinese studies have markedly increased. The second part discusses forces operating on social studies teachers today which quite naturally relate to area studies. These include calls for teachers to change their technique from expository to inquiry teaching; the numerous arrays of kinds of materials from which teachers must choose; pressures to teach new content areas but lack of training to carry it out; and the number of complex societal changes now in progress. Specific problems facing classroom teachers as they attempt to teach Chinese studies are identified. The major portion of the paper provides ten alternatives to typical suggestions on how to improve teaching  about China. These alternatives differ from the usual suggestions in that they emphasize supplementing and/or using existing resources rather than beginning anew, and make inservice and preservice training available locally. Alternatives focus on topics dealing with a survey of the field; exchanges and visits; developing a newsletter; resource centers; inservice and preservice training; activities at teachers meetings; evaluating teaching materials; preparing new teacher materials; and checking with teachers and students to verify what they wish to know about China. Appendices are included. ED 065 402 is a related document. (SJM)",

Although it is obvious that none of the students will become expert guitarists in the time alloted, hopefully, through a program based on guided self-instruction and doing, they will: (1) learn to play guitar with enjoyment and at least minimum competence; (2) find a satisfying and acceptable means of personal expression; (3) develop an interest in music and/or musical performance; (4) widen both their musical and educational horizons; (5) discover possible aptitudes for the creative and/or performing arts; (6) increase their ability to learn; and (7) undergo positive attitudinal and behavioral changes. Included in the  guide are sections which: (1) help the student to select the guitar most suited to his tastes; (2) explain the use of capos and picks, and; (3) show a suggested model for a course outline which includes tuning the guitar through the use of grand barre chords. Many photographs are used to demonstrate the use of correct hand positions and chord formations.

        "description":"Among the explorations undertaken in the course of establishing the National Institute of Education (NIE) by the NIE Planning Unit was a set of eleven conferences of experts on educational problems, methods, and content. Three of these conferences focused on the contributions that anthropology, psychology, and sociology might make to the fulfillment of NIE goals. This report covers the conference of seven sociologists in mid-1971. Attention focused on the possible conflicts among the three basic goals posited for NIE--between equality, on the one hand, and quality and resource effectiveness, on the other. Quality and resource effectiveness require different kinds of education to meet the different needs and talents of individuals; but such differences cannot exist without  accompanying connotations of higher and lower, good and bad, prestige and stigma. Populist sentiment, in the name of equality, seems to call for leveling all education up, or down, to a common, undifferentiated, system. The group felt that sociologists could be helpful in finding goals and strategies for achieving appropriate diversity while minimizing problems of status and stigma. Other problems addressed included questions about what makes an educational institution resilient, the relationships between size and other characteristics of educational institutions, and the characteristics of our educational system that make teachers feel weak and ineffective.

It is reported that the various fields of differential psychology, learning theory, developmental psychology, counseling and clinical psychology, and social and community psychology all need to be involved in any scientific attack on the three major problems in education mentioned above. Each of the fields are briefly reviewed in light of suggestions on how each field can relevantly contribute toward solving educational problems. Psychologists have much to offer NIE in the area of program evaluation and assessment, and experimental  revision. The report also deals with the need for human resources and training of scientific personnel, teachers, and psychologists in a type of research that combines discipline and tasks, i.e., in which theory can be applied. Emphasizing that effective educational research needs to be interdisciplinary in approach, suggestions are made for a series of meetings devoted to interdisciplinary aspects. Arguments, pro-and-con, for NIE support of the training of behavioral scientists and after thoughts of several participants are summarized.

Since the values of formal education are now in question and alternative systems are being suggested, it is offered that non-formal educational processes be examined by anthropologists who can guide and carry out educational research. Informal interviews, determination of the usages of languages and behavior unique to the community, and other methods are advocated. By systematically studying ethnographic materials we notice systems different from our own in which skills, knowledge, and values are transmitted without schools. It is also suggested that ethnographic research take place in the classroom  to explore social interaction in the school systems, examining the administrative structure and the relationship between school and community. Other topics briefly touched upon are: 1) a suggestion for a post-doctoral NIE fellowship; 2) a listing of special fields of anthropology most relevant to education; and 3) a need for the development of a cross-cultural data bank on education which would permit the cross-cultural testing of established ideas.

        "description":"The Public Law enacted in 1971 requires that fundamental subject matter areas taught in Wisconsin's public schools be assessed. It is proposed in this paper that assessment of the State's social studies programs needs to focus its attention on the school environment, which educators can and should control, change, and improve, rather than assessing student performance or on breaking social studies into component parts. In essence, evaluation procedures need to focus on the cultural environment; i.e. what the schools are doing to provide quality educational experiences and opportunities permitting examining, questioning, and testing evidence and beliefs, which influence the thought and actions of students and which contribute to the social studies goal of increasing human  understanding. When assessment focuses on academic achievement of students it only measures the circumstances of birth and social situation. Three questions describing the existing pattern of social studies experience are: 1) What opportunities are provided by teachers to involve students in the action of problematic inquiry? 2) What is the role of student and teacher in social study? and 3) Do the methods and materials of social studies instruction maintain the integrity of the social disciplines?

Methods define the elite, then collect data about them. Problems encountered included the lack of specialists who are equipped to develop data sources, problems due to specialization, difficulty of collecting data because of the purging of political outcasts from  official sources, and the unavailability of data on minor political figures.

The purpose of the program was to make training a basic teaching interaction skills an effective and economical procedure in the preparation of elementary teachers. In each study, the students' teaching behavior was analyzed specifically according to procedures developed and tested at the Far West Laboratory. The curriculum of skills selected for study and use in the program have been Minicourse I, Effective Questioning; Minicourse V, Tutoring in Elementary Mathematics;  and Self-Guided Teaching Skills. Results indicated that the process appears to operate independently of the variables of supervisory attention, visual and written models, and large-group discussion as compared with independent study.

One section was devoted to deprivation and its effect on learning, and the second section was devoted to learning and teaching theory. The third segment was conducted during the third week of the program and involved an actual teaching situation in which trainees were divided into eight groups with three to five trainees in each group.

        "description":"The secondary teacher preparation program at Wheeling College prepares students to become master teachers. The program emphasizes three themes: person, partnership, and performance. To develop the person, the education department helps the student to define beliefs, state goals, establish plans for reaching set goals, and evaluate progress. To develop partnership, the education department and a committed school share resources to establish a realistic professional environment. The third theme, performance, provides students with a framework so that they can compare their progress with behaviors and competencies of master teachers.

These activities were administered to 52 undergraduates in the Brigham Young University Individualized Secondary Teacher Education Program. Following each activity, an evaluation of the participants was made. The predictive areas of evaluation included a) interaction of the participant with the students during the student teaching experience, b) interaction of the participant with other teachers during student teaching, and c) general teaching effectiveness of the participant during student teaching. Following  the student teaching, an evaluation of the participants was made by their cooperating teachers. A comparison of the data revealed that the 7-minute microteaching was the most consistent predictor of student teaching success. The 30-minute session was the poorest predictor.

The empirical measurement of these dimensions allows predictive evaluation for teacher selection, formative evaluation for teacher development, and summative evaluation for retention or release decisions.

In discussing the goals of teacher training programs, it is concluded that these goals are dependent on the goals in education, i.e., learning. Some external factors affecting the teacher training programs are reviewed; stressed is the cost of education, the demand for changes in existing teaching practices, and skepticism regarding the relevance of years of training to competence in the classroom. A review of the literature in Canada and the United States on current practices and the need for change in teacher education reveals parallels between the two countries. Of the new directions  discussed, the following programs are suggested: the new teacher as a change agent, team teaching and differentiated staffing, and teacher internship. The abstracts of 30 documents on teacher education are included along with two pages of references. The appendix presents some policy statements of School Trustees Associations advocating changes in teacher training. (BRB)",

The philosophical rationale stresses the acquisition of knowledge in teacher education programs. Competency-based teacher education programs broaden this scope to include the application of this knowledge to actual learning situations. The psychological rationale stresses the manner in which individuals learn, as well as behavioral objectives. The concern for behavioral objectives provides the impetus to specify and measure specific learning outcomes. Systems analysis emphasizes the purpose, process, and components of teacher education.

Two groups of teachers were formed for in-depth study--those scoring in the top 27 percent (High Group) and the bottom 27 percent (Low Group) of the 180 teachers providing useable response sets. Each group contained 48 teachers. Teachers in the High Group were compared with teachers in the Low Group on 25 factors in four categories: personal, classroom, school environment, and performance. A one-way analysis of variance was made by computer, comparing the means of the two groups of  teachers on all 25 factors. The F-test was applied to determine significant differences. Results indicated that teachers scoring high on the TRST and teachers scoring low represent different samples of the population. Further conclusions are indicated.

In the spring semester 1971-72, 260 students were enrolled in the student teaching courses in the College of Education, Louisiana State University (LSU). At the beginning and end of the semester, they were asked to respond to two Likert-type rating scales: self as a person and self as a teacher. By use of the usual weighting procedures associated with the Likert scale, it was possible to arrive at a self-concept score for each student at the beginning and at the end of his work as a student teacher. Changes were determined by finding the differences between pretest and posttest scores. Results indicate that positive changes occurred during the student teaching experience for 75 percent of the  participants, greater growth in self-concept occurred on the part of off-campus student teachers than was the case with those assigned to the LSU laboratory school, and the mean self-concept changes of student teachers who worked in inner-city schools was in stark contrast to the comparable measures as applied to the group working in suburban schools.

In the third grade the primary focus was upon control of extremely high rates of disorderly behavior through the use of a home-based management system. The results revealed that in each of the three classes where academic performance was the primary variable, statistically significant  differences were obtained on the Metropolitan Achievement Tests when compared to control groups. Further, all classes increased in number of academic levels passed. Additional experiments indicated that a) it was the point reinforcement system which controlled the children's rate of academic performance, b) student tutors led to increased levels and academic performance when compared to periods when no tutors were present, and c) the academic performance of the tutors was facilitated by the process of teaching other children.

A classroom teacher was designated by the school administration and the university staff as a clinical professor responsible for the student teachers in his building. A university professor was assigned to the building as a consultant. Orientation meetings were planned for the classroom teachers. Throughout the year a series of assessments were effected by the leadership team to analyze and remedy problems associated with the operation. These assessments became the basis for the strategies which  were used for the development of a series of in-service meetings. The program has not been in operation long enough to be evaluated; however, there does seem to be an indication of strong support among the teachers and student teachers.

Data were collected using the Brophy-Good dyadic observation system. Results revealed that teachers differ significantly in their teaching behavior with respect to high- and low-expectation pupils. However, teachers did not discriminate differentially between boys and girls. The findings of the study suggest that teachers probably do communicate differential performance expectations to different pupils through their classroom behavior, and the nature of this differential  treatment is such as to encourage the pupils to respond in ways which would confirm teacher expectancies.

Teacher authoritarianism had no effect, calling into question interpretations of previous studies of teacher leadership. Teacher power orientation showed strong negative relationships to peer influences and peer group centrality. With classroom climates typed according to morale, peer influence, and peer group centrality, combinations of teacher leadership modes--based on task and expressive and power orientations--were strong influences on classroom climates. Teachers legitimated their power through satisfaction of task and socio-emotional needs of the students. Non-legitimation of power leads  to alienated or rebellious classrooms.

The objectives of the initial statewide assessment program should be: (1) to collect student performance data that can provide a status report on the quality of education in those goal areas  identified as having high priority; (2) to introduce the concept of assessment and its usefulness as a source of information for both decision makers and concerned parents or taxpayers; (3) to provide a starting point whereby those managing the statewide effort may gain useful experience in operating the program; and (4) to develop a method of data analysis that can illustrate the variability of performance due to individual differences among students and to the social context in which they live. Essential components of the assessment should include the provision for an advisory committee and for selecting its members, conducting meetings to inform citizens and school personnel of the nature, scope, and methodology of the program, data collection materials, data analysis procedures, and  reporting strategies.

The 31 custodial and 34 humanistic items were randomized, and the initial version of the PCB Form was administered in 20 schools in Illinois (13 secondary and 7 elementary). A total of 2,815 usable PCB Forms were collected, representing student descriptions of 129 of the 130 teachers who participated in the investigation. The mean class size for the sample was 21 students. A one-way analysis of variance was applied to each of the questionnaire items. All of the items survived the analysis of variance test; the final PCB Form retained 20 of the original 65 items, 12 being positive to the  humanistic end of the control continuum and 8 characterizing the custodial extreme. The theoretical range of the scale is from 20 to 100; the higher the score, the more custodial the behavior. A one-way analysis of variance indicated that the scale differentiates among subjects while clustering within subjects. A reliability analysis of the form yielded a coefficient of .92 as estimated by Cronbach's alpha. To test the general hypothesis that there would be a positive relationship between custodialism in educators' pupil control ideology and custodialism in their pupil control behavior, data were drawn from 43 schools (14 elementary, 16 junior highs, and 13 high schools). Students described the pupil control behavior of their teacher, counselor, and principal; teachers, counselors, and  principals completed the Pupil Control Ideology Form and a personal data sheet. The general hypothesis was supported. (DB)",

In addition, the appropriateness of the Kunkel-McElhinney model of curriculum evaluation, as perceived by professional school personnel, was examined and assessed. The study data were collected from written reports, structured interviews, and questionnaires. The evaluation process utilized by George Peabody College for Teachers requires that identification and presentation of findings, implications, and recommendations be conducted on a team basis. The acceptance or rejection of data, a finding, an implication, or a recommendation is the prerogative of the professional personnel whose program is being  evaluated. In-service education based on program evaluation requires the involvement and commitment on the part of the professional school personnel. Data are presented on the program evaluation of two schools: Lipscomb Elementary School, Williamson County, Tennessee, and Highland Heights Junior High School, Nashville, Tennessee. As a result of the evaluations, it was concluded that: (1) the Kunkel-McElhinney model is an effective instrument for collecting data and accurately describing the teaching-learning situation of a given school; a majority of the teachers found it appropriate and of good quality; (2) program evaluation can lend both structure and meaning to an ensuing in-service education program based on its findings and recommendations; and (3) participation in a program  evaluation enhances the possibility of teacher involvement in and commitment to desirable curricular change.

The 90-item mathematics test was selected. Thirty-five raw score distributions characterized by seven levels of skew and five group sizes were constructed. Group responses were submitted to a computer program which estimated the model's parameters according to a maximum likelihood procedure. Results of the study indicated that the estimates derived from the Rasch measurement model were not independent of the group used to produce them.

A summative evaluation of CRP courses 2 and 4 was carried out in 1972. The evaluation was conducted using a design called &quot;Separate Sample Pretest Posttest,&quot; to ascertain the effects of the two courses on student performance. Students, classified as self-studying or classroom, were selected at random to participate in the study. In total, 16 teachers and 368 students  took part in the evaluation. A multiple-choice test was used to measure student knowledge of the CRP material, and two of the four groups of students also received a questionnaire to obtain data on the amount and type of use of the CRP, as well as on the technical aspects of the program. The test results were subjected to an analysis of variance with an unweighted-means solution. The results indicated that students who utilized CRP, in a self-studying or classroom mode, did significantly better than students who did not use CRP. The evaluation points up the significance of the CRP as an instructional device with technical excellence. The questionnaire replies indicated a favorable attitude among the users of the CRP. It is recommended that the tests used in the evaluation be incorporated  as part of the CRP package. (DB)",

Self-reported and pre-post measures were obtained in three areas, simple cognitive, complex cognitive and attitudinal. The subjects were 162 graduate students enrolled in six different graduate courses. Partial correlations relating self-reported measures of growth to post test performance on measures of achievement (simple and complex cognitive) and attitude, controlling for pre-test performance, indicated that self-reported measures of academic growth were primarily related to growth in attitudes toward the subject matter of a course.

From the five stimuli, ten triads were formed and presented to the Ss for similarity judgments. After training, the procedure was repeated.

Six psychologically interpretable factors emerged, accounting for approximately 32 percent of the total variance. These six factors corresponded to six of the hypothesized twelve skills involved in the test.

Student reactions to the Adjective Self-Description instrument verbal-graphic summary reports were as follows: about 80% felt that the reports were easy to understand, interesting, and informative; 85% said they would like detailed interpretation of the  results; but less than half felt that the reports helped them in self-discovery. Preference as to mode of feedback showed that students who were sensitizers preferred the personal interview, whereas the repressers preferred feedback by mail. Since the report generators are not designed to produce documents that can be given directly to students, the important benefits are believed to depend on individual interpretation and interchange with a professional counselor. The compiled normative data, in particular, those relating to the sentence completion instrument, have been found to be invaluable for training counselors of students in teacher education. (DB)",

The first, the Madison Project, designed, produced, and evaluated computer-generated testing reports that were useful to teachers and informative to parents. The reports, which were narrative in format, were structured as follows: the first five paragraphs described the pupil's performance on the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills as a whole and on each of the sub-tests; then, lists of specific areas were printed for which the pupil was diagnosed as either proficient or deficient. The teacher report was very similar to the parent report with the addition of imbedded percentile ranks. A class-summary report for the teacher was also generated. This  report discussed the class as a whole and concluded with specific suggestions to the teacher for improving class performance in which their performance was weakest. Narrative testing reports were generated for a random half of 52 fourth-grade classes in 17 schools. The greatest shortcoming of these reports was the absence of a pupil report. In the second project, The Iowa Project, which developed a model for a narrative reporting system for the fifth-grade level Iowa Tests of Basic Skills, the most important changes from the Madison Project were: (1) the addition of a pupil report; (2) the inclusion of growth statements; and (3) the use of three alternative levels of the parent and pupil reports--levels that are based on overall pupil performance on the test battery.

The effectiveness and efficiency of education are basically the responsibility of educators. The manner through which human and material resources are provided to support education is the responsibility of public groups. Agreement between the parties is essential, possibly through a written contract detailing objectives and responsibilities. School boards are accountable to the public for the selection of educational goals. Administrators and other district personnel are accountable to the school boards for maintaining a program appropriate for meeting agreed-upon objectives. Teacher  accountability can be judged either by teaching ability and effort put forth or by specified pupil outcomes. Progress can be measured with a number of indices revealing the impact of schools upon the progress of students. The basic indices are school age pupil information, data on graduates, institutional information, and community information. The public is demanding proof that its educational system is doing what it is supposed to do. Colorado's Educational Accountability Act requires an accountability program in every district and emphasizes cost effectiveness. Colorado is the administering State for seven States involved in the Cooperative Accountability Project to study and provide assistance with accountability problems. (KM)",

The systems design cycle employed has three phases, policy-making evaluation, and action-implementation. During the first phase, the general philosophy or mission of the organization is described, the goals and objectives are established, their priorities are ordered, and the alternative programs to meet those goals and objectives are generated. During the second phase, the relative worth of the various alternatives is determined, and the objectives' attributes and their measures of effectiveness are established. During the third phase, the programs to be implemented are chosen from among the  alternatives, put into effect, evaluated, and the results fed back into the next planning cycle. Problems in communication with teachers and coordinators and in overcoming resentment of the approach are discussed. One of the major successes of these efforts to implement cost-effectiveness and program budgeting in this school district is that the goals and objectives of the education process are defined clearly at all levels. Systematic planning and evaluation of costs and effectiveness also brings about greater dialog among the parties involved and more concern for planning program alternatives. (KM)",

This study was designed to investigate the efficacy of the aptitude treatment interaction design to research seeking to identify differential educational payoff of alternative educational programming based on aptitude information. Four aptitude measures were administered to five first grade classes. Following pretesting, curricular interventions were instituted for six months. Class I received word-form configuration training. Class II received visual-perceptual training. Class III received language-conceptual training. Class IV served as a Hawthorne Group in which a resource teacher provided on-going  emotional support to the regular teacher. Class V received no specific curricular intervention. Following the intervention phase, six measures were administered as post-tests. Analyses of variance revealed no significant aptitude-treatment interaction in any case. Factors believed to have contributed to the failure to produce significant disordinal interactions include: (1) non-normal distributions on the aptitude measures; (2) an inability to identify discernably different groups on the basis of the aptitude measures; (3) non-parallelism of pretest regression lines; and (4) low reliability for the aptitude and post-test measures.

        "description":"Evaluation of ongoing educational programs must necessarily differ from the basic research design; it must change to meet the changes of the program and its environment. Over the three years of the operation of the Philadelphia \"Let's Be Amigos\" bilingual program, the kinds of data generated in the program evaluation have evolved in response to the demands of project management, community and intra-school-system relations and the Office of Education. The evaluation of process aspects and product aspects of the program have evolved in opposite directions: (1) evaluation of the pupil performance program outcomes has tended to evolve from informal, criterion-referent approaches to more rigorous experimental designs; and (2) evaluation of processes has tended to evolve from formal  methods (observational checklists, forced-choice questionnaires) to less rigorous methods (open-ended questionnaires, interviews, etc.). In the first operational years, assessment of pupils' reading was primarily criterion-referent, involving a word-calling test. The assessment of reading skills was modified after first-year evaluation, first passing through a phase in which an attempt was made to prepare materials-derived, criterion-referent tests to assess more complex skills, and from there to standardized tests. Evaluation of curriculum development has evolved from use of a formal checklist to use of an interview structure with open-ended questions. (KM)",

The personality variables were measured by subtests of the Personal Preference Schedule of the Psychological Corporation Examination for Schools of Nursing--achievement, orderliness, persistence, congeniality, altruism and respectfulness. Ss were two classes of nursing students in 1968 and 1969 (N=7). Ss were given the PPS prior to entering the nursing school. The SBE, taken after completion of the 24-month program, was a composite score of five subtests--medical, surgical, obstetrical, pediatric and psychiatric nursing. Pearson product-moment  coefficients of correlation were computed for each predictor variable with the criterion and with each other predictor variable. The scales apparently have little value in predicting success on the SBE, but the small sample size should be considered in interpretation. It is recommended that other personality measures be studied as predictors. (KM)",

Changes in scores for defensiveness correlated to an extent significantly greater than zero with changes in self-concept scores in both groups. Analysis of variance revealed that: (1) scores from the treatment group changed significantly more in the defensive direction than in the control group; and (2) the mean score change for self-concept in the treatment group was not significantly different from the mean change in the control group.

A series of examples showing the results of an incorrect measurement of components is given. Several correlation matrices were taken from books on factor analysis and multivariate analysis. Each matrix was submitted to a principal components decomposition, and those vectors whose roots were greater than 1.0 were then rotated according to the normalized varimax criterion. Following this, several matrices were calculated. A clear pattern resulted. Components supposedly orthogonal to each other often come out highly correlated. In addition, factor loadings that are small in the rotated principal components structure are often moderate  to large in R/zh and R/zk. Thus, the researcher who interprets and names components finds that his scores have a completely different meaning than he anticipates. Any use of these scores in further analysis will result in a serious distortion of conclusions. (Author/KM)",

Four forms of a problem-solving inventory were developed which differed in mode of presentation. The original form consisted of real-life problem situations portrayed in cartoon form and shown to Ss as slides with an accompanying answer book and audio tape of item stems and directions. The additional forms were: (1) a picture-book form with drawings in the answer book and no slides; (2) a form in which pictures were described in a short paragraph and substituted for the pictures in the answer book; and (3) a form in which 3-D full-color models based on the drawings were used. Ss  were 410 second and fourth graders from two schools enrolling a large proportion of disadvantaged and advantaged children, respectively. Ss were randomly assigned to the test forms. Analyses of variance were computed to determine the effects of socioeconomic status, grade, sex, and testing mode upon performance. No significant sex differences were found. Best performance from children, both second and fourth graders, disadvantaged and advantaged, was obtained on the middle forms of the test, not on the most abstract or most concrete forms. It is suggested that the lack of support of the hypothesis may have resulted from a lack of manipulative material on the concrete tests and too much irrelevant information in the test content. (KM)",

General satisfaction with the program was expressed by both teachers and principals, but many thought that not enough was being done.

The Gates-MacGinitie Reading Tests were given to alternate program classes in Grades 4, 5, and 7 in the early Fall of 1971 and again in the Spring of 1972. Results of the evaluation showed that there was general support for the alternate program from the parents and from students enrolled in it. The  results of the standardized tests indicated that in reading skills, the Grade 4 and Grade 7 students both made substantial gains. The Grade 5 students sustained a loss; and the Grade 6 arithmetic scores were average or above in comparison with other Vancouver students. There were essentially no differences in attitudes towards school between students in the alternate program and those in the regular program. The only significant difference was in respect to &quot;School Social Structure and Climate,&quot; with the alternate program students showing more positive feelings.

        "description":"To find an acceptable way of reducing testing time without altering the administrative use of admissions tests, a study was conducted to test the prediction that scores on subtests of the General Achievement Tests (GAT) in Social Studies, Natural Sciences, and Mathematics could be used to predict the total test score. All answer sheets for 1000 subjects (250 male and 250 female) who had previously taken the tests were rescored for part scores on the two sections of each test. Pearson product-moment coefficients of correlation were then computed by sex for the two subtests and the total score on each of the three GAT tests. Regression equations were then derived from the correlations and used for the prediction of total scores made by subjects in the cross-validation sample.  Correlations were then run between the predicted total scores and obtained scores previously recorded. Results showed that none of the original part-whole correlations exceeded +.95. The study findings resulted in discontinuance of the complete GAT tests at a four-year urban college. Each college applicant took only the 15-minute subtests on the three tests, and a total score in scale-form was predicted thereby for use in the admissions process. This reduced the testing time for the GAT from 120 to 45 minutes. The conversion of subscores into predicted total scores was part of the computer-scoring operations for the admissions test battery. It is concluded that the disadvantages of reduced reliability were offset by the advantages of reduced testing time. (DB)",

Five scores ranging from the 14th to the 93rd percentiles were selected, and the proportions below these five scores became the proportions to be estimated. The variances of the estimates of these five proportions were computed for over 20 different sample designs; results from seven sample designs are presented. Using the error variances that were computed for each of the seven sample designs, the ratio of the error variance based on a cluster sample to  the error variance based on a simple random sample of pupils was determined.

The major kinds of accountability enacted in each of these states are one or more of the following: PPBS, MIS, Uniform Accounting, Testing, Evaluation of Professional Employees, and Performance Contracting. The three most frequently specified systems are state testing or assessment, evaluation of professional employees, and PPBS. The legislation enacted so far most frequently emphasizes educational purposes or goals and points to the general direction of the public's expectations for accountability. Beyond goals and objectives, legislation is likely to be either prescriptively specific or general enough to permit wide latitude by which goals may be fulfilled.  Thirteen states require measuring the level of pupil performance by some form of state testing or assessment. Most of the assessment legislation states an intent to evaluate the effectiveness of school programs and curriculum. The most common reasons for adoption of state assessment programs are the improvement of pupil performance, evaluation of educational programs, and the identification of performance levels in relationship to educational needs. States are more frequently turning to goals-and-objectives-based state assessment models. This permits the measurement of student performance with criterion-referenced instruments. A model act for a comprehensive state educational assessment and accountability program is provided. (DB)",

When institutional test results are desired--that is, results for schools or school districts--not all pupils need be tested. Two alternative testing program designs are proposed, for situations where individual test results are desired for some subject areas or grades, and institutional results are desired for others. Seventeen alternative finite-population sampling procedures can be used with these designs. The efficiency of each procedure is evaluated using data from a medium-sized school district, and relative efficiencies are derived. Some sampling  procedures are found to yield acceptable precision for estimation of district-mean achievement with a sampling fraction of only five percent. (Author)",

The programs measure length of a text and its complexity in terms of the average length of words and sentences, map the occurrences of keywords or phrases, calculate word frequency distribution and certain indicators of style. Trials of the programs, in studies of readability and reading rate, in aiding editors, in grading essays, and in identifying sources of response bias in multiple choice tests, demonstrate the potential applications of these algorithms in educational research and the usefulness of augmenting FORTRAN's computational facilities with character-processing capability.

A second purpose of the study was to investigate the assumptions which high and low rated, open and traditional teachers of the poor hold about open education. The Edwards Personal Preference Schedule, the Thurstone Temperament Schedule, and the Barth Scale were administered to 30 open and 30 traditional primary grade teachers, each rated by a supervisor as high or low in teaching ability. The high, open group contained 15 teachers; the low open section included 15; teachers in the high traditional subdivision numbered 15, while the low traditional category also included  15 teachers. The results demonstrated no significant personality differences between high and low rated open and traditional teachers. Open teachers, however, appear to emphasize intuitive judgment when assessing a child's work. In contrast, traditional teachers are more likely to rely on objective tests to determine what the child has learned. Whereas open teachers tend to believe that learning occurs through exploration, unthreatened by adults, traditional teachers are likely to feel that a child learns best when knowledge is transmitted by the teacher to the child.

Additional data were collected concerning the quality of negative environmental stimuli perceived by children from each group. The instrument used to measure  anxiety was the General Anxiety Questionnaire, which incorporates items from the Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale and the General Anxiety Scale for Children.

This paper focuses upon racial characteristics of both adults and children. The experimental procedure is as follows. An adult works with one child selected from a four-child group following a prescribed pattern to raise that child's expectations. The experiments reported here involve children in mixed race groups, two black children and two white children per group, with either black or white experimenters. Children in second, third, and fourth grades who attended an integrated school in Baltimore served as subjects. Middle-class young adult women, some black and some white, served as  experimenters. When the race of the experimenter matches the race of the treated child, significant increases in the expectations of the treated child occur. But when race of the experimenter differs from that of the treated child, significant increases occur for black children interacting with white adults, but not for white children interacting with black adults. These effects for children in racially-mixed groups disagree with earlier work on single-race groups. (Author/JM)",

The study was conducted in an urban elementary school in Virginia, housing approximately 400 children and 14 teachers, grades one to six. The racial balance of the elementary school population was 60 percent black and 40 percent white. The majority of the children were from  lower or lower-middle class backgrounds, 54 percent and 42 percent, respectively. Two elementary school counselors interpreted the social skill training two days per week during the period from October, 1971--April, 1972. The counselor's time utilization was documented by a log of their activities. To evaluate the effectiveness of the counselors' intervention, a Personal Competence Inventory was administered to children in grades three to six in October, 1971 and March, 1972. The Inventory included two tests: Peer Acceptance Index, and Self Perceptions Index. The teachers also rated their pupils. (Author/JM)",

Ninety percent of the students enrolled in the program will be accepted into the Project One Hundred program, if they wish to attend the University of Detroit following graduation from high school. The program identifies students in Class A and Class B Detroit Public Schools located in Title I areas that are desirous of obtaining a college education. In the 1971-72 program, project staff consisted of a coordinator, secretary,  two counselors and eight instructors. The summer program staff operated with two less instructors. The goal of the summer program was to provide participants with incentive to aspire to a college program. The program devoted time to providing vocational and educational information, as well as individual and group counseling. The 39-week academic year program was designed to continue the efforts of the concentrated six-week session in which incoming twelfth graders were initiated. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This report is a continuing analysis of the achievement of ethnic minority children who are bused for integration, and of other children attending the schools receiving bused pupils. The findings reported here are limited to children in the primary grades. The achievement of kindergarten and first grade bused and &quot;receiving&quot; pupils has increased steadily and significantly. The average achievement of second grade bused pupils has shown no general trend while the general achievement of second grade receiving pupils has increased. The average achievement of third grade bused and receiving pupils has decreased. The achievement of average and low achieving second and third grade bused pupils has decreased, indicating that the instructional programs have not met their needs. The  achievement of high achieving second and third grade bused pupils who have been able to enter the &quot;mainstream&quot; of the receiving schools has followed the same general trends as the average achievement of the receiving pupils. There have usually been significant correlations between the achievement of bused and receiving pupils attending different schools at the kindergarten, first, and second grade levels. This indicates that both bused and receiving pupils benefit from the instructional improvements. Overall, the gap between bused and receiving pupils has narrowed only slightly. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This paper argues that social demands on the educational system have changed dramatically in the course of the past few years. A more affluent American society is now demanding that education provide a medium where excellence can be attained by the most able students and a certain minimum level of competence is attained by students who are less academically inclined or less gifted. No longer can the system afford to act merely as a sorting device, certificating the better-motivated and academically inclined Americans. We are making a major financial sacrifice to extend years of schooling to the majority of the population and we want assurance that these additional expenditures will pay off in increased performance for those who are forced to attend school longer. There is now an  almost universal demand for a drastic reduction in the number of semi-illiterates and for general mastery of simple mathematics. What is not too clear is how to meet these goals. Different groups in our society have placed demands on the schools which are not only overlapping, but sometimes inconsistent. Most often, the schools have been asked to perform those functions which the family was least capable of providing. Such diverse expectations not only influence the programs of different educational institutions which cater to groups with different socio-economic compositions, but give rise to strident attacks on the system.

In each school district staff members interviewed the superintendent, board members, principals, teachers, and students at elementary and junior and senior high schools, as well as parents of school children. In addition, classrooms were visited and students were observed in daily school activities. The particular schools were selected with the assistance of the superintendent to provide a cross section of experience with integration. Likewise, attempts were made to  select for interview teachers, pupils, parents, and board members in such a way as to obtain as wide a range of opinions as possible on school integration. Interviews were also conducted with black and white community leaders or organizations spokesmen with differing viewpoints on school integration. Information obtained through interviews was supplemented by data in court decisions dealing with school desegregation in each district, the desegregation plan for each district, and statistical and background materials provided by school officials of each city.

The purpose of the Commission on Civil Rights is to identify problems which recur in school districts undergoing desegregation, and to describe how they have been met. Specifically, the Commission has been interested in learning how students of all races react to one another when they sit side by side in schools for the first time in their lives. It has also sought to learn how teachers react to students of other races and socioeconomic backgrounds as well as to teachers of other races. Why and to what extent does &quot;white flight&quot; occur? How have some school districts prepared for desegregation? What, if any, problems are  created by busing? Of the nine communities investigated here, some are in the South and some in the North. Some are rural and others are heavily urban. Some are central cities and some suburbs. Some have been forced to desegregate by court order or the threat of fund termination by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Others have undertaken to eliminate the dual school system on their own before being required to do so. Still others have sought to desegregate their schools simply because they felt it was the right thing to do. (Author/JM)",

Previous research suggests that the closer the values and social goals of students and their teachers, the more likely that positive classroom interaction would occur. It was therefore hypothesized that middle class teachers would positively reinforce their middle class students more frequently than their lower class students. Because social class groups respond differently to various kinds of reinforcement, it was hypothesized that those reinforcers which prove most effective for each group would, in time, be recognized and employed by the teachers. Hence, it was expected that verbal reinforcers would be observed more often  with middle class students, and non-verbal reinforcers with lower class students. Schedules of teacher reinforcement for lower and middle class, white students were recorded with a systematic observational technique, the Teacher Reinforcement Schedule. Twenty minutes of recordings were made by six observers within each of 24 fifth and sixth grade classes. At both grade levels, classes were equally divided into those with predominantly lower or middle class students. Significantly more total reinforcements were given to middle than to lower class children. (Author/JM)",

It was hypothesized that the suburban youths and Puerto Rican youths would develop formal thought before the American educated Puerto Ricans. Three groups of subjects were selected on the basis of culture and education. Their ages ranged from 12 to 18 years, five males and five females being tested at each age level. Subjects performed four Piagetian tasks: the balance bar, the pendulum the floating objects task, and interpretation of proverbs. Subjects were tested individually and interviews were  recorded on tape. Each subject had opportunity to use Spanish if he preferred to do so. When considering the three manipulative tasks together, the ability to give two out of three answers at formal level placed subjects in the formal category. The age at which 60 percent of a group were operating at formal level was considered the age of onset of formal operations for that group. Suburban youths achieved full formal thought by age 12-13. The same level was achieved by age 14-15 for the American educated Puerto Rican group. The Puerto Rican educated group reached this level at age 16-17. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This study is derived from the Congressional mandate for a study of the various provisions involved with the 1965 Elementary Secondary Education Act Title I grant determination and distribution process. The description of Title I provisions emphasizes the process relating to the allocation of funds for local educational agencies (LEA's). The maximum LEA grant is described as the product of the number of eligible children and the amount of the basic grant per child; the allocation actually received by the LEA; however, results from the application of a procedure that reduces the amount of all entitlements to a sum that can be covered by the appropriation. The practical problems of identifying and counting the eligible children for annual grant determination are defined. These  include attempting to maintain a comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date data base. In addition, some of the issues associated with the selection of an appropriate grant per child are mentioned. These include whether the basic grants should reflect regional differences in the cost of education and/or whether they should be adjusted for areas with special needs, e.g., high concentrations of eligible children. Consideration of alternative possibilities suggests that the present enumeration of eligibles can be improved by using the so-called Orshansky poverty data from the 1970 census.

Towards this end, a program was initiated in the form of &quot;Think&quot; Workshops and was held in five schools in East Harlem and Harlem. Attending in the second year of the project were over 60 adults. Some were mothers who worked with their own children at home; others were paraprofessionals who trained their own children as well as a  comparable group in the school setting. Another group of paraprofessionals worked only with children in school. In all, over 150 subjects were involved in this study, 100 of them in the past year. Results indicated that statistically significant gains occurred in the cognitive competence of both the adults attending the workshops and the youngsters trained by these adults. In the area of self-esteem, it was found that statistically significant gains in social competence by the adults led to a statistically significant lessening of respect for authority by this same population.

        "description":"The objective of this study of California projects, funded under Title I of the 1965 Elementary Secondary Education Act, was to shed additional light on the cost-benefit and &quot;critical mass&quot; issues which are central to today's compensatory education planning and policy making. It covers reading and math programs in grades one through twelve. The study sample included all schools in California which reported both achievement gains and expenditures. The data analysis utilized statistical controls such as the removal of the effects of regular per-pupil expenditures when the impact of supplementary expenditures was assessed. Saturated schools--those with 75 percent or more of the pupils eligible for Title I participation--were found to differ significantly from unsaturated schools  with the latter showing greater gains in both reading and math and greater Title I per-pupil expenditures. Within the unsaturated schools, however, there was no relationship between achievement gains in either reading or math and any combination of regular and supplementary expenditures. In saturated schools, a significant relationship was found between achievement gains and Title I per-pupil expenditures for reading but not for math. The expenditure differences accounted for about ten percent of the variation in achievement. (Author/JM)",

The  subjects of the study were 218 Puerto Rican families having children in the public schools of two large cities in Connecticut. The instrument utilized was a structured interview schedule developed by the author for the purpose of the study. The instrument, available in parallel English and Spanish forms, consists of 47 items dealing with parental perceptions and family background factors relating to the education of Spanish-speaking students. The instrument was administered on an individual basis in home interviews conducted by a team of bilingual educators. (Author/JM)",

The population from which PSDS students are to be selected is defined by two criteria: (1) that they do not have a record of academic achievement adequate enough to secure admission by  traditional criteria to a degree program at a selective college or university; and (2) that the main reason for this lack of achievement be due to a cultural or social disadvantage. This report is an attempt to discuss and to define these terms, to provide a model for admissions based upon them, and to evaluate past admissions procedures with respect to this model. Since the two criteria given above define a potential student population much larger than the number of students the program can accept, an attempt is also made to set up criteria for selecting specific sub-groups of the defined population in an objective manner.

The Cultural Study Center at the UNIVERSITY OF Maryland, College Park, has developed an approach to working with racism in educational institutions which may prove useful to others attempting change in this area. The model is aimed primarily at changing whites or white oriented institutions. In order to demonstrate the model, the approach used in two different Maryland school systems is discussed and evaluated. One program was conducted for a large suburban system, with more than 160,000 students enrolled, which had had many racial incidents and  problems over the years, and was expecting a court ordered desegregation plan to go into effect shortly after the conference was held. A two day conference for 91 key central office staff and supervisors was held. The second conference, lasting for two and one half days, was held for 36 principals, vice principals, and some central office staff of a small, primarily rural system with 17,000 students. This system was just beginning to have increasing numbers of blacks enrolled in their schools as a city's suburbs pushed outward, and had had the beginnings of relatively mild confrontations between blacks and whites.

        "description":"A lunch program on the Lower East Side with kosher meals for Jewish children and Italian meals for Italian children and a health program in which visits to students' homes are a regular service are a small part of the efforts made 50 and 100 years ago to meet the needs of New York City's immigrant school children. The implications of such a picture are very relevant to the present. They suggest a far different perspective on community control than we generally assume: a perspective in which current demands for community control, especially on the part of black and Puerto Rican parents, may be seen as an extension of, rather than an exception to, those voiced by urban minorities in the past. The scope and variety of past demands for community-controlled schools in New York City  are especially visible in the actions of three groups: Irish Catholics in the 1840's; Jews in the period surrounding the turn of the century; and, Italians in the middle 1930's and early 1940's. In the Irish, Jewish, and Italian communities in which such community and educational leaders as Bishop John Hughes, Julia Richman and Leonard Covello worked, the idea of a community-oriented school struck a vital nerve. When we look at these communities in perspective, we find interest in virtually every community-control issue--from food to curriculum--which we now debate. (Author/JM)",

The study was also intended to determine the extent to which known male gang members, who attend an innovative high school, differ significantly in their attitudes over a period of time from each other and from known male gang members who attend one of the traditional high schools in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Many Philadelphia schools at the secondary level are plagued with the problem of a high degree of disruptive pupil activity. This activity affects the entire educational program within these  schools and also the safety of students as they move to and from school. Much of this disruptive activity has been attributed to boys who are known to belong to subgroups called gangs. Parents, students, teachers, administrators, and members of the community at large are concerned with increasing gang activity and its consequences for school programs and the larger community in general. The search for solutions has led many large school systems to explore the role of alternative schools in the educating of alienated youth. (Author/JM)",

The design of this study was of the post-test form only. This was done in order to control for the effects of testing. The sample for this study consisted of all the black students in the fourth and sixth grades located in three eastern inner-city schools. The population of the three schools included grades kindergarten through six, which were comprised of 67 percent black and 33 percent white students. All three schools were receiving aid under Title I of the Elementary Secondary Education Act. Included  in the fourth grade sample were 74 experimental and 63 control subjects. The sixth grade sample was comprised of 66 experimental and 51 control subjects. The experimental data consisted of the raw scores on the Self-Social Symbol Tasks and the Children's Self-Concept Scale. The experimental group viewed materials which consisted of commercially available segments of 16 mm. motion picture films portraying persons who can be viewed as positive black models. The treatment spanned the period of approximately one hour. Instruments used in this study were administered by means of an audio tape recorder and prepared overhead transparencies. (Author/JM)",

Included for comparative purposes was a test of comprehension of the standard version of the concepts. Finally, a qualitative analysis of the language and questioning behavior that occurred in the two-child communication task was also made. Subjects of the study included 54 second grade and 38 fourth grade black children from an economically-depressed inner-city area of New York City. All subjects were native speakers of English. The results indicate that no special &quot;black dialect&quot; way of expressing basic relational concepts by elementary  school children emerged from the two-child communication task, although grammatical forms of black dialect were occasionally observed. This finding would seem to indicate that there is no well-defined group of nonstandard concept rules to be used by classroom teachers in helping their black elementary school students &quot;learn&quot; basic concepts. Comprehension and production of basic concepts are apparently not tasks of equal difficulty for black elementary school children. Thus, children often may appear to understand what is being said, but may not be able to say it for themselves or communicate it to others. (Author/JM)",

That means that a State is still getting money for a low income child who was in the first grade during the 1960 census and who now has graduated from high school, completed two years of junior college, married, found a job, and is expecting his or her first child. It is fundamentally wrong to continue to aid districts who have long ago lost many of the children whom we have pretended they are serving. Why not actually distribute funds on the basis of actual educational need if that  is the condition we are attempting to treat? If we move from a level of income distribution to a level of educational need distribution, I believe we will build a stronger program with a larger constituency and with a better chance of actually showing positive results. It is proposed that a relatively new type of test is administered, the criterion referenced test, to a scientifically drawn national sample. That sample could be used to establish relative needs among the States. Through the use of criterion referenced tests one can best escape the onus of comparing the level of achievement of one child and one school against another. (Author/JM)",

Stages one and two represent a needs assessment for testing, in which the target population and general subject areas to be assessed are determined. The remaining four stages are performed for each test developed. They include: item pool development, item filtering at the technical and lay levels, and actual test performance by item. The plan for test development is based on two assumptions: (1) that with all the tests that have been developed over the years, there are many good or modifiably good items available in most assessment areas; and (2) it is easier for people to select items relevant to a curriculum and culture than it is for them to write such items. In order to assess the testing needs in the Department of  Education, leading members of the administration were interviewed and asked to rate the importance of assessing the various subject matter areas. In addition, they were asked to indicate at what grade levels such assessment should take place. Based on this information and item availability, a minimal test construction program was adopted for the 1972-73 school year to test the model. It consisted of creating assessment instruments in English reading and science at the sixth and ninth grade levels. This program was begun in October 1972. A similar development program is planned in other areas over the next two years. (Author/JM)",

However, the case will remain open for two reasons: (1) provisions of the settlement require monitoring of the school system's compliance with the terms of the compromise for the next three years; and (2) certain aspects of the case were consolidated with the metropolitan school desegregation suit (Armour v. Nix), which requests a desegregation plan that will include all students in the nine  metropolitan Atlanta area school systems. This case is still pending in the U.S. District Court in Atlanta, awaiting action by the U.S. Supreme Court in a similar case involving the metropolitan Richmond, Virginia schools. The compromise plan would increase the number of students in desegregated schools in Atlanta from 27,239 to 38,718. Under this plan, approximately 59,000 students, virtually all black, will remain in segregated schools. The plan would increase the number of desegregated schools in Atlanta from 47 to 64. The other 83 schools in the system would be segregated black. (Author/JM)",

An experimental program in cooperative vocational education, SPACE was devised by EdCo, an educational collaborative of seven Boston area school systems, for the purpose of offering potential dropouts in the vicinity an alternative form of education: going to school in an industrial setting. SPACE'S uniqueness lies in the fact that its 45 students receive both academic instruction and work experience in an interrelated manner. Instruction in course content is given during the morning hours while work experience is an evening event. The teacher-pupil ratio and free atmosphere prevalent in the environment allows for the special tutoring of slow students and the carrying out of independent  activities by other more advanced pupils. The involvement of teachers with students does not stop in the classroom but overlaps to the work arena. SPACE is not without problems; in fact it has many, some of which are: (1) finding other sources for expanding the project should tbe enrollment increase, and (2) finding support should the present aid be curtailed.

A literature review was conducted by means of three computer searches of ERIC journals and other relevant indexes. \"Manufacturing\", as part of the industrial arts curriculum, has a commonality of content which may be presented to students through simulated learning activities in a variety of classroom and industrial settings. A model for program development was recommended in order to meet the educational needs of people from Kindergarten through post doctorate levels for curriculum materials on  manufacturing, which are presently emphasized mainly as an overview course for the middle grades or junior high school level. This model is entitled \"Common Body of Knowledge for Management Consultants\". A comprehensive educational delivery system for manufacturing curriculums should be further developed to present this common body of knowledge. (Author/AG)",

Data were gathered from practical nurses who graduated in the fall of 1967, 101 instructors from 14 separate practical nursing schools,  and from 405 students enrolled in 13 different schools. Job satisfaction scores were fairly equally distributed among the five classes of social groups and the greatest problem of LPN's seemed to be that they felt there was a lack of recognition of their contribution. Results indicate that students taught by instructors who appear too full of their subject and are overly definite and forceful, achieve lower state board scores than would otherwise be the case.

Also, little is known about major problems for which local directors need information, methods of seeking information used by these decision-makers, information normally used, or the criteria employed in selecting information. The purpose of this study was to identify the critical problems of local administrators of vocational education and the information sources they utilize. Data were collected from certain local administrators, selected by a stratified random sampling technique, through the use of telephone interviews and a mail questionnaire. Major conclusions include: (1) Local administrators generally perceived little need for information for use in  problem resolution, (2) Most decision-making was in the absence of an information search, (3) Respondents desired experienced people as their major information source, and (4) The major criteria for utilization of print materials were the familiarity or degree of experience of the administrator with the materials, and the content quality.

If the Florida State Plan is to become more than a seldom-read document prepared solely in compliance with federal funding regulations, overall priorities, procedures, and goals for statewide vocational program implementation must be identified. Technical legal deficiencies and areas of ambiguity in the administrative provisions should be corrected. The whole plan should be reviewed and revised in order to increase its value in statewide planning for vocational education. Specifically, target populations needing vocational education should be accurately identified, the labor supply and demand data should be expanded, and all program  goals and objectives clearly set forth. Long and short-term priorities for each goal and objective must be specified, data reliability and validity should be assessed, and program plans consistent with the data should be drawn up. Appropriate emphases in program development, identifying specific manpower needs and locations, must be noted in the state guidelines.

Current program cost data were incorporated with data collected by means of student followup questionnaires. Positive and significant rates of return were realized from public and student investment in  each of the four selected vocational programs, with investments being recouped in less than two years. Of the four programs, only the air conditioning program showed statistically significant differences in rates of return on investments. Vocational students had higher rates of return than regular secondary students, although vocational student costs were greater. The methodology and the benefit-cost planning model proved effective and could prove useful in allocating resources to maximize public and student benefits. Development of vocational programs in Florida, especially in air conditioning, is recommended.

Included are descriptions of vocational education policies for these services, the target populations, their special training needs, successful vocational education programs for the handicapped, and the role in rehabilitation that is played by community agencies. The three problems most often mentioned by vocational educators were: (1) Fears of vocational education teachers about integrating the handicapped into regular vocational classes, (2) The lack of joint planning among agencies, and (3) The hesitancy of school personnel to accept new programs. Since the present services are not adequately meeting the needs of the handicapped in Florida, increased  efforts by local agencies are required. State consultants in vocational education should be utilized. The following needs should be met: (1) work evaluation centers and personnel development for vocational education, (2) local surveys of job opportunities for the handicapped, (3) inservice training relating to the handicapped, (4) better coordination of services, (5) continued research and evaluation, (6) additional consideration of the emotionally disturbed and the socially maladjusted, and (7) the effecting of community acceptance of the handicapped.

Differences in expectations and satisfactions are noted among and within these groups: (1) students enrolled at different schools, (2) parents of these groups of students, and (3) parents and students. Questionnaires for parents and students were used to gather data, which were analyzed by percentages and presented by means of tables. The most limiting factor in the study was restriction of the number of participating schools to ten. A consensus was revealed among parents and students concerning 16 broad educational goals and the importance of vocational programs.  Vocational goals mattered more to vocational students and their parents. Satisfaction with the schools' performances varied widely, with the vocational and junior high school students and their parents being generally more satisfied than their counterparts in the traditional high school. Improved vocational guidance, physical facilities, and classroom activities are needed at the high school level to provide adequate programs.

However, retail food prices rose four times as much as in 1971, soaring locally by 43 percent in the past decade and 95 percent since 1947. At wholesale, the price gains of industrial commodities have slackened, except for leather and lumber products. The average weekly earnings for factory workers reached a new high to nearly $148, although wage advances tapered off because of the Stabilization Act. Union participation and time lost due to strikes are below the national average. Of the  jobs added in New England, 24,000 were in the region's factories and 43,000 in nonmanufacturing work.

The survey results indicated that about 40 percent of working women were not economically dependent on a male wage earner, that differences in early socialization of boys and girls explain many of the seeming sex differences in work attitudes, and that women show less desire for initiative on the job. Various tables present the data, which rank the importance of job characteristics to working men and women. A related finding was that the average underpayment to women was $3,458 annually as compared with equally qualified male workers. (AG)",

Intended for use also as a statewide model, this interdisciplinary curriculum utilized extensively in its development research studies by a teacher educator from Virginia, Professor Lucy C. Crawford. Teacher competencies were identified, as well as a set of concepts and generalizations for various subjects in distributive education.

A search was made to determine whether this system would yield a contiguity structure of occupations, by interests, showing the relationships between interests in different types of occupations. Three samples, consisting of 1,114 Israeli boys aged 13-14, were given one of three interest questionnaires, each containing about 100 names of occupations. In each sample of test subjects, Pearson correlations between groups of occupations belonging to the same level field were obtained and then tested to determine whether they were consistent with Roe's theory (i.e. existence of a graded order of levels in each field and a circular,  single-deviational structure of fields in each level) or some other pattern useful for occupational guidance. Some results were: (1) A graded order of levels of occupations was found in Service, Business, Organization, Technology, Outdoor, Science, General Cultural, and Arts and Entertainment fields, (2) Service, Organization, Business, Technology, and Outdoor fields were arranged in a simplex structure, (3) Business, Service, General Cultural, and Science fields comprised another simplex structure, and (4) The Arts and Entertainment field could not be incorporated in either structure, while Business and Service fields appeared in both.

Roe's occupational classification system was used to code the students' occupational choices into one of eight occupational groups based on the primary focus of activity in the occupation and into one of six occupational levels based on the degree of personal autonomy and level of skill and training required. Analyses of similarities and differences between students' occupational choices revealed: (1) Decisiveness of occupational choice seemed to correspond with satisfaction with school in general and with the  value of school work in eventual employment, (2) Male students were more independent of friends' influence regarding their occupational preferences and choices than were females, (3) Teachers were consistently seen as most influential regarding occupational preferences and choices, and (4) Fathers' occupations were related to the sons' occupational choice, but mothers' occupations did not seem to be related to daughters' occupational choices.

To secure information, personal interviews were conducted in 1,490 households, among 2,003 recently separated veterans, and with 786 business executives, representing prospective employers. Some findings were: (1) The American public and employers are aware of how returning veterans should be treated and yet are guilty about the way exservicemen are being treated, (2) The state of the economy and greater competition in the job  market contribute to the difficulty veterans face in finding jobs, and (3) Assimilation into the labor force after service does not appear to be related to educational attainment but to race and amount of time since separation. These and other results are provided in chapters covering: (1) the reception received by veterans following separation, (2) problems finding employment, (3) drug usage, and (4) the role of the Veterans Administration in facilitating readjustment.

Analysis of data collected during a statewide survey of 630 Florida residents in late March and early April 1971 revealed that perceptions of VTAE seem to be generally positive, but information about vocational education seems to be low as well as unrelated, in any systematic way, to images of VTAE. It was also found that some groups, namely older citizens and housewives, are reticent in regard to participation in VTAE program. When asked to define the term vocational education, persons of higher social status tended to respond in concrete terms, viewing vocational education as either specific skills, training,  or education, while lower status persons tended to say that vocational education was &quot;something good.&quot; Groups identified as potential users of public information programs included: (1) low income groups, (2) high school dropouts, (3) service and manual workers, (4) non-whites, (5) housewives, and (6) senior citizens.

Once the plan has been developed, program priorities can be determined and disseminated to school districts, and local education agencies can be encouraged to submit proposals.

The purpose of this progress report is to describe the magnitudes and patterns of change in personal characteristics and in educational and labor market status that have occurred during the three years between the initial and fourth surveys and between the second and fourth surveys. Analysis of 1969 interview data from approximately 75 percent of the original sample suggest that: (1) high school graduates and dropouts can be distinguished by behavioral, experiential, and attitudinal differences, (2) interfirm movement (change  in employer) by out-of-school youth declined sharply with increasing job tenure, (3) a substantial amount of occupational movement occurred among out-of-school youth, (4) a substantial residue of unreality is exhibited in the young men's occupational aspirations, (5) patterns of change reflect the occupational progress expected as careers unfold, (6) instability of educational and occupational goals were exhibited, and (7) the socioeconomic gap between black and white youth was wider in 1969 than when these men first left school.

        "description":"This 5-year study evaluates the first diploma nursing program in Canada within an educational institution, that of Ryerson Polytechnical Institute in Toronto. Various factors affecting student and Ryerson graduates performance are studied to answer two questions: (1) What type of nurse is being prepared through the Ryerson nursing program, and (2) Is this a practical way to prepare nurses? Specifically, data were collected relating to: (1) characteristics of students enrolling in the Ryerson program and of the graduates, (2) job performance as viewed from employer feedback, and (3) variables influencing the students. Comparisons were made with three progressive schools in Ontario--two large hospital schools and one autonomous school. Numerous tables present the data, which focus  on seven main vectors within the system: (1) the students' personality development, (2) their increasing career orientation, (3) the benefits of Ryerson's academic freedom, (4) program activities, (5) faculty role, (6) internalizing the &quot;professional&quot; nursing norms, and (7) integration into the professional system. The Ryerson graduate gives good nursing care, developing both as an individual and a professional, which shows the potential value of a 6-semester college nursing program. Instruments used in the study are available as VT 019 889 in this issue. (Author/AG)",

Using the Holland occupational classifications, initial interviews revealed statistically significant differences among the four groups. For instance, younger men generally showed a narrower range of occupational experience. For black men, the narrow range of experience persisted for the older group. Older white men held jobs in a broader range of occupational categories, and were more stable in their initial occupational categories. An attempt to establish the  predictive validity of two of the four models was largely unsuccessful, indicating that the derived models could not be generalized. Since the Markov models did not improve the predictive efficiency of the Holland occupational classification, it is predicted that the subjects would maintain the Holland category of their initial occupation.

        "description":"To assess the effectiveness of videotapes depicting clinical situations in the teaching of nursing, videotapes were made of the everyday, real-life situations that persons and their families experience throughout their illness in various parts of Canada's health delivery system. Three validation sessions, attended by representatives of nursing services and schools of nursing, were held to gain some concensus on the nursing content of the tapes. However, validity could be established only at a general level of content due to variations between participants regarding the nature of observations, needs of patients, and characteristics of effective nursing and successful delivery of services. In addition to the validation sessions, an experiment which focused on the nursing of aged  persons was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the tapes in the teaching of nursing. Senior students in two hospital nursing schools in Montreal were used as subjects, and a nonequivalent control group design was used for the subjects in one school, while the Solomon Four-Group Design was used for the other school. Analysis of pre- and posttest results did not support the hypotheses, and changes were suggested for a future evaluative study. Future project plans include: (1) preparing three short films, (2) organizing films and tapes into a series, (3) developing a teaching program, (4) distributing the films, and (5) testing the films.

Overall, there emerged from the workshop sessions an acknowledgement of the magnitude and complexity of the problem and the need to work toward a solution. There was evidence suggesting that the stated mission of providing developmental studies within the community college system was not receiving the necessary degree of emphasis in learning resources.  Many felt that until a stronger philosophical educational commitment is made to the needs of the disadvantaged, both systemwide and institutionwide, minimal success can be achieved. Other areas of concern were: (1) use of existing testing and placement devices, (2) regular learning time blocks as opposed to unrestrained learning time, (3) grading practices, and (4) effective teaching/counseling methods and techniques. It was suggested by the participants that future efforts be devoted to the development of three or four model programs. The research proposal and some workshop materials are appended. (SB)",

Possession of facts as marketable skill is inadequate. Traditional curriculum and teacher roles need to be changed. All students, including the academically, socioeconomically, and physically handicapped, need to understand that career development is a process which they can control. A wide range of activities is needed which offer ways to explore and test self-identify. Career development activities are needed at an early age, while the student is in the mainstream of education. By changing the role of the teacher as a dispenser of fact to that of change agent for the learning environment, by building the curriculum around career development, and by  offering a cooperative program to vocational education pupils together with job training and placement services for the handicapped, more pupils will be able to find post-secondary employment. A developmental approach at the elementary and secondary levels to career-oriented objectives should serve to improve the curriculum of vocational and technical education and reduce the flow of unprepared youth into the pool of the unemployed.

Approximately 80 students from each grade were pretested and posttested and an analysis of covariance was performed on data obtained from the tests. The adjusted post-test means for the experimental group were 11 percent higher on language achievement, 24.5 percent higher on mathematics achievement, and 18 percent higher on occupational awareness than for the  control group. Teaching strategies of field trips, resource role models, manipulative activities, simulation, and multimedia activities were incorporated into instructional resource units to provide the experimental group experiences.

An increase in the number of students attending institutions for agricultural education has been often viewed as the solution to this problem. It is argued here that an increase in number is only a partial solution, and that an equally pressing problem is to enable people with rural backgrounds to enter these educational institutions. Facets of this regarding Colombia are covered in the discussion which follows. A brief review of recent agricultural development in Colombia is presented first to point out some of the major problems. An overview of Colombia's educational system follows to suggest why rural people are  isolated from employment by Colombian agricultural agencies. To further illustrate this point, information is presented from a study of the backgrounds of Colombian agricultural college students. The discussion concludes with several suggestions on ways better agricultural leadership might be developed in countries similar to Colombia. (Author/KM)",

Factors considered were supervisory district, sex of worker, percent of time devoted to 4-H work, and years of tenure with the Tennessee Extension Service. Questionnaires were completed by 345 Tennessee county extension agents and by 15 district supervisors on 11 adult and 6 junior leadership training needs. Agents were asked how well-trained they considered themselves in adult and junior leadership, and supervisors were asked how well-trained their agents were. Both groups were asked to indicate three priority training needs. Results showed that: (1) district supervisors gave lower ratings to their agents on  all items than the agents gave themselves; (2) comparison on district and sex-of-worker bases yielded only a slight degree of disagreement on self-perceived needs; (3) male agents more frequently rated themselves \"not very\" well trained in junior leadership than did female agents; (4) supervisors in general selected more priority needs in adult leadership training than did the agents; (5) agents felt that the junior leadership priority needs were of greater importance than did the supervisors; and (6) as the percent of time devoted to 4-H work increased, so did the proportion of agents indicating adult leadership priority needs.

The roles in a community adult education network are: (1) network agent--makes contact with the informal groups in his area, becomes fully aware of the problems, needs and interests in the area, and identifying those that are explicitly  educational and recognizing those that would benefit from some form of adult education; (2) resources agent--sets up a network of contacts with organizations that can provide educational resources for the groups with whom he has established contact; (3) educational guide--acts as educational adviser for peer group learning situations, and helping interested individuals undertake more formal education leading to qualifications; and (4) teachers--persons with special knowledge of a particular subject of interest to the students. In this network, personal relationships with members of the community are all-important. The network is flexible and offers an opportunity for local control. (KM)",

Experiments in adult education in the nineteenth century gave rise to the idea of adult education as remedial, intended to correct the unfair treatment the lower classes received at the hands of an elitist educational system. Recently, this idea has evolved into the concept of lifelong education. A continual updating of instruction is incumbent upon both backward and advanced societies. The fundamental change in the way of life of the masses, resulting in today's affluent society, is a major factor in the current popularity of the concept of lifelong education. One of the problems of lifelong education is that of preparing people for new forms of life and  making them aware of the dangers or an apathetic or superficial attitude toward cultural values. Instruction should be regarded as an asset in itself and not merely as a means of achieving greater material success. The modern conception of education necessitates &quot;de-schooling&quot; schools; lifelong education calls for the rational integration of the teaching activity at all levels. This integration would involve re-distributing educational activities over the whole of life and harmonizing formal education with out-of-school education. The success of such a program depends largely on factors outside the control of educationists--the structure of society and the processes and forces within it. (KM)",

Tanzania's commitment to build a socialist state, based on traditional African socialism, is also a commitment to socialist education, the necessary tool for social development. Since work is a lifelong duty for any socialist, work-oriented education is also a lifelong duty. Tanzania is replacing the elitist colonial education system with universal education aimed at implementing socialism and promoting self-reliance. Part of this is a national campaign for adult education in order to combat the poverty and backwardness resulting from ignorance and to explain the meaning of the new social order and its values. Adult education is an integral part of the employee's work program. A major goal is  to wipe out illiteracy by 1975. Specific objectives of adult education are: (1) to mobilize the rural and urban masses into a better understanding of socialism and self-reliance; (2) to provide leadership training at all levels; (3) to eradicate illiteracy; (4) to spread knowledge and skills in agriculture and rural construction, health, and home economics to improve the productivity and standard of living of the people; (5) to provide followup education for primary and secondary school leavers; and (6) to provide continued education in the form of seminars, evening classes, inservice training, correspondence courses, and vocational training. Literacy centers and other adult education centers are beginning this work. In addition, all educated Tanzanians are socially bound to conduct adult  education classes. (KM)",

But reforms within the educational system have shown that the system is not equipped to carry out its own revolution by itself. A large part of the responsibility for education is being placed in a new sector in the social environment--out-of-school education--which provides literacy education, &quot;second chance&quot; courses, and basic technical training. But if this approach is to be successful, it must be provided with the ability to break down psychological barriers to change in education. Direct experience of the contradictions inherent in the educational system has bred the conviction that action to promote lifelong education is necessary. (KM)",

The characteristics of lifelong education in Cuba are implicit in its revolutionary setting, and the task of carrying it through has become an obligation and a right affecting every citizen. The training of teachers is at present the center of greatest effort. The Literacy Campaign, which mobilized every political or mass organization, abolished illiteracy within one year. Adult education is offered in elementary education, secondary course of worker education, worker-farmer faculty, language teaching, and youth movement. Classes are held in almost any location, and sessions are adapted to the industrial or agricultural area. The government is active in facilitating the incorporation of women into the political,  economic, and social development through special literacy, technical and other educational programs. Youth movement schools were established to promote and organize the education of adolescent pupils above the age for elementary schools. Teacher training includes study and research on educational subjects, active participation in the educational workshop, and participation in People's Cultural Circles and in literary and scientific seminars. The circles and seminars are part of a governmental effort to make Cuban education an integrated and continuous process. (KM)",

It synthesizes the papers submitted by re-grouping the questions posed, the problems identified, and the steps taken or considered in order to determine the scope, the nature and the modalities of the process leading to lifelong education. Lifelong education appears to be not only an educational concept but also the terminal point of the educational level of evolutionary process, the object and the result of which has been to bring education closer to new requirements and conditions of an educational, economic, social, political and cultural nature. The points of view expressed by the participants add up to provide a definition of the origins, objectives,  scope and content of lifelong education. They also make a contribution, essential for the purpose of the symposium, toward making an inventory of the different types of approaches and of steps necessary to insure a transition from existing educational systems to lifelong education.

        "description":"Lifelong education is one of the leading principles of Peru's Educational Reform, part of the general post-revolutionary transformation of Peruvian society. The idea that state obligation to the child begins with the school age has been done away with. The three levels of Peruvian education are divided into modalities to allow for special attention to individual problems; the modalities are basic vocational education, out-of-school higher education, special education, special vocational qualification and educational extension. The country is now in the process of social mobilization, one of the components of which is community participation in the administration of lifelong education. The educational nuclearization system has established social units grouping two to four thousand  inhabitants. The purpose is to mobilize the community to utilize their resources to develop lifelong education. The new plan for adult education ranges from literacy education to vocational and technological training. Vocational education is aimed both to prepare workers for jobs and to provide on-the-job training in technological advances. The National Service for Training and Industrial Work (SENATI) was established to improve the deficient qualifications of personnel in industries. A certificates system and coordination of out-of-school education are currently being studied. Educational extension consists of discussion groups and circles created by community groups. (KM)",

        "description":"Since the ideal of lifelong education is closely related to the reorganization of the entire educational system, it is necessary to recognize the distinction between education and its administration. Democratization, continuity, flexibility and freedom are principles related to planning and administration; active participation, initiative and self-help are principles related to the educational process. Lifelong education achieves integration of the educational system through integration of the five individual competences fostered by families, schools, and other groups. They are physical, communicating, practical, cultural and civic competences. Civic competence comes with actual experience of adult life, so adult education has a special responsibility for this competence. Japan  has experienced the greatest changes in its history in the last half of this century, and the idea of lifelong education was introduced to help individuals make the social adjustment. Some of Japan's advantages in realizing lifelong education are: (1) diffusion of formal school education; (2) cultural homogeneity; (3) increasing interest in the idea; (4) social education--for parents, women, the aged, those out of school, adults in general; and (5) administrative measures--for social education. The government decides policy for social education services by investigation, experimental projects, exchange of information and opinions, and financial support. (KM)",

        "description":"The development of lifelong education in England has been slow due to the dualist educational philosophy characteristic of the English middle and upper classes. The two governing characteristics of British adult education have been its predominant concentration of provision for the working classes and its preoccupation with the liberalizing role of adult education to the exclusion of its role as an instrument of social and occupational mobility. Substituting &quot;education for adults&quot; for &quot;adult education&quot;--to include all learning activities adults engage in--would lessen the confusion and prejudices associated with the latter term. The shift of public educational provision toward the adult life-span for both basic and continuing education is likely to continue. But the expected  expansion in education will be financially supportable only if the cost to the public purse is reduced, either by fees provided by users or by reducing the non-educational content of educational expenditure. Continuing education has become necessary because of: (1) the expansion of educational opportunities at the basic and initial training stages of life; (2) the scientific and technological revolution; and (3) the increase of leisure and the associated increase in material standards of living. The Adult Education Department at Manchester University has two objectives: (1) to develop an anthropocentric approach to the education of adults in its teaching and research; and (2) to place adult education centrally within educational policy and practice as a whole.

The results indicate that AWOL and Non-AWOL subjects differed on personality, education, intelligence, aptitude, and military component. No differences were found in attitude toward the Army, race, or physical status. AWOL and Non-AWOL subjects differed in age during initial unit assignment, but only among 17- and 18-year-old soldiers during basic combat training. Only  19-year-old and older subjects differed in career orientation. In general, the same factors that were related to AWOL were related also to military skill and leadership potential. (Author)",

Three broad interest areas appear in the literature -- the rationale for such education, teaching techniques and teachers, and program and curricula. Vocational rehabilitation, the major area where retarded adults have found backing, supports the thinking that retardees have the potential to live in the community at a fair level of independence. Teaching techniques for them differ slightly in an emphasis on more motor skills, on task analysis with rewards at each step, and on clinical teaching, with more detailed records and  observation. Literature on teachers is almost non-existent. Trends seem to be developing toward day care centers, sheltered workshops, and activity centers. Curricula reflect the missions of the centers, heavily weighted toward vocational rehabilitation. Most references are annotated. (Author)",

Homogenous and heterogenous groups with varying degrees of interest in participation were chosen for the study. A survey of the literature concerning participation in adult education was made. As part of this study, notice was made of the participation in adult education in the light of aspects of motivation. Three obstacles found to hinder adult education are: (1) those posed by the individual which form a part of the his own attitudes and life situation, (2) those related to that which is offered, and (3) obstacles in the societal environment. Other data mentioned in this study concern: (1) study obstacles in adult education, (2) specifying the problems, (3) collection of information and methodology  for collection, (4) construction of instruments, and (5) plan for the preliminary investigation.

        "description":"A comparative study was made of responses to the four-year followup questionnaires of the classes of 1967-68-69 of Jackson County Adult Evening High School. The purposes were to reveal any significant differences between classes in their responses, to answer questions concerning the benefits received by high school graduation, and to obtain results that would make the conclusions drawn more valid than they might be for any single class because of the larger numbers involved. The three followup studies were compared on a question-by-question basis. Among the results obtained are the following: (1) the benefits (educational, social and/or financial) do not differ significantly among these classes, regardless of class size, year of graduation, age or sex; (2) the program enables a  significant number of housewives to seek and find employment which they did not do prior to completion of high school; (3) a very significant number of graduates in the labor market experience job changes or promotions far in excess of what could occur by chance; (4) about 12% have received additional training beyond high school; (5) nearly 23% have studied some subject since graduation; and (6) there were no significant differences between classes or between men and women in the numbers reporting to be better off financially. Recommendations concerning use of the study, this and similar programs, and dropout studies are made. (For related document, see AC 014 268.) (KM)",

        "description":"A study was conducted of two Missouri communities to investigate neighborhood change between 1956 and 1966 and social cliques as possible emerging replacements for neighborhoods. Ozark, in an economically disadvantaged southern part of the State, has experienced drastic farm changes, from general to dairy farming and later to enterprises more compatible with off-farm employment. The majority of the people have become disassociated from farming as an occupation and many others are marginally committed. In Prairie, most changes were improvements in farming; the majority in the open country are engaged in farming full time. In interviews in 1956 and 1966, farmers were asked questions eliciting the names of specific persons with whom each farmer said he associated most closely, those  he regarded as best friends, and those from whom he obtained general information about farming and with whom he exchanged work. Changes were assessed by examining shifts in membership within social cliques and neighborhoods and from one to another and social association and friendship. The shift from neighborhood to clique association did not occur in Prairie, but both social association and farming informational exchange became more diffuse. In Ozark, a shift occurred at the expense of neighborhood membership, but the shift to affiliation with neither a neighborhood nor social clique was even greater. The changes support the view that social clique formation is the product of a differentiation of interest occurring within the society. (KM)",

The experiment was conducted at six program sites during the summer and spring program operations, which consisted of showing eight short films on nutrition on the educational television channel. Volunteer leaders were recruited and trained to organize viewing groups of children and conduct followup activities such as demonstrations, games, and field trips. Volunteers at three of the sites were reimbursed during the summer and at the other three sites during the spring. Volunteers and dropout volunteers were interviewed after the first phase concerning their  attitudes, background, and reading and television viewing habits. Training for the second phase was improved, after which more interviews were conducted. Among the findings were the following: (1) Volunteers do not like to be pressured into volunteering and do like adequate training; (2) reimbursement reduced the dropouts of volunteers and encouraged them to involve more children in viewing; and (3) the organization which most in low-income areas participate is in the church, which could effectively be used in implementing programs for low-income people. An appendix contains announcements and folders used in promotion, a handbook for volunteers, and nutrition games and activities. (KM)",

The objective of establishing and maintaining cleaner air in the mines has been substantially achieved by the Bureau of Mines inspection system. The second, which provided that an afflicted, but not disabled, miner could transfer to a job in clean air, has been used sparingly by the miners. The third, which provided for Federal benefits for miners fully disabled by black lung (and for widows and orphans) has been highly successful in numbers of beneficiaries. As of October, 1972, about 88,000 miners and 87,900 widows and orphans were receiving benefits. In 1972 Congress amended the legislation to extend  the benefits to other lung diseases, and another 23,800 miners qualified on that basis, with the processing still incomplete by December 1972. On July 1, 1973, the Federal program becomes the responsibility of the Department of Labor for a transition period with benefit payments charged back to the industry. On January 1, 1974, the program is to be returned to the States under workmen's compensation laws subject to Federal standards. (Author/KM)",

        "description":"The Finnish-Canadian Citizenship Project was organized to teach English to older Canadians of Finnish descent in British Columbia. The 24 enrollees had between one and ten years of formal schooling. The Finnish Canadians use a dialect of English words with Finnish pronunciations that must be unlearned in order to learn English. The students established the course objectives and stipulated that they wanted teachers who understood their special linguistic problems. Diagnostic interviews, using an audiovisual device to picture the speech patterns of teacher and student, were used to divide the class into three groups based on the level of fluency. The Berlitz method was used, and teachers concentrated on sounds that present special difficulties for Finns--w, wh, ch, f, z, th. During  interviews at the last class, students were permitted to evaluate their experiences. Most reported an improvement in speaking ability and self-conficence and a loss of timidity in communicating with others in groups. Implications of the program considered useful for adult educators include: (1) the wisdom of making initial contacts with participants through a person they trust, who understands the problems of the particular ethnic group; (2) the value of having the participants plan their own program; (3) the importance of arranging for a group to learn together; and (4) the need for diagnostic sessions.

The author reviews the reactance model and attribution theory, both of which focus on the recipient's perceptions of the basis on which help is rendered and the implications of this for him. Several equity theories which consider the helper-beneficiary relationship as a continuing social interaction are also discussed. The author's own laboratory research program has investigated two general questions: 1.) What is the effect of reciprocity on attraction for the helper? and 2.) Which form of help delivery leads to more usage of service, enhanced helper attractiveness, and better recipient feelings--helper-initiated  help or self-requested help? Finally, implications of much of the data on self-requested help are applied to federal changes in welfare policy. (Author/SES)",

The mastery learning theory itself was proposed by Bloom (1968) as a method of individualized instruction. Subjects for the study were graduate and undergraduate students in educational psychology who progressed through a series of six units requiring mastery tests upon completion. While preassessment data showed substantial individual differences among students' knowledge of educational psychology, mastery learning theory suggests that such student differences may simply mean that different amounts of time  are required to learn a task. Analysis of the data reveals that males generally reacted more favorably than females to the mastery learning technique and also that graduate students, who were primarily practicing teachers, rated the course less favorably than did undergraduate students.

By examining what is involved when the client takes what he has learned about himself or what he has learned to do for himself and applies this knowledge to better manage the contingencies of day-to-day living, the questions of relevancy as well as accountability in  counseling are faced. Finally, by bringing into focus the relationship between the counselor's behaviors and the outcomes of counseling, it is possible to help trainees to recognize that they do have immediate and observable effects upon their clients.

        "description":"This study examines the efficacy of specially devised information in altering students' perceptions of the appropriateness of personal problems for counseling and their willingness to seek counseling for such problems. Women at a large Eastern university provided the sample for this study; one group received oral-written information, another group received written information only, and a third control group received neither oral nor written information. The results indicate that students who received both written and orally-presented information showed an increase on these dependent variables, while students receiving only written information did not. Consequently, the conclusion was drawn that written information may inform students of the availability of counseling, but it does  not alter their impression of kinds of problems appropriate for counseling sessions.

The study was undertaken to establish the parameters, within a controlled laboratory setting, of the various effects of group decision making on the social, affective, and drinking behavior of the members of that group. The subjects in this research were four white males who had been \"therapeutic failures\" in New Jersey State Facilities. Data were gathered by (1) consumption measures; (2) observational and self-reporting instruments; and (3) physical and physiological measures. Because the subjects' drinking behavior was altered significantly both by a differential reinforcement and by decision-making, the authors conclude that:  (1) social influence was a powerful determinant of alcohol consumption; (2) social and economic controls did alter the subjects' behavior after they started drinking; and (3) treatment implications emerge indicating that total abstinence from alcohol might not be as effective as therapeutically modulated, controlled drinking.

Three broad areas of knowledge, understanding, and skills are identified to serve as a base for new career guidance programs: (1) self-knowledge and interpersonal skills, (2) career planning knowledge and skills, and (3) knowledge of the work and leisure worlds. Goals are stated in terms of student outcomes rather than as program outcomes, and a number of performance objectives and activities are developed for each goal. Panelists, whose reactions to the keynote address are  included, have all been involved in operating programs where an important activity has been the translation, examination, and evaluation of their own efforts to use behavioral outcomes as a measure of their effectiveness.

The VPI was administered at the beginning of a group guidance program and the preference for Holland's six personality styles - intellectual, conventional, enterprising, realistic, social, artistic - were correlated with selected scales on four criterion tests. The results revealed statistically significant correlations supporting the validity of Holland's VPI for use with adult women. The social and the artistic scales of the VPI remained in doubt as to their validity for this sample. This sample seemed to gravitate to the conventional occupations, and these women tended to reject the nurturant role. (Author)",

The sample consisted of 1646 upperclass college women who had the time and opportunity to develop reasonably firm career goals but had not undergone many goal modifications due to various external circumstances, e.g. marriage or children. Of the total sample, just 109 expressed career aspirations in nontraditional fields. Results suggest that women perceive a narrow range of career possibilities because they are fearful of venturing into a man's world; in addition, higher  education has done little to expand women's awareness or interests beyond the sex stereotyped career roles. The author references other studies which indicate that counselors in higher education are ineffective in dealing with women students who are considering male-dominated careers.

The theoretical framework upon which the study is based is Robert White's (1959) theory of effectance motivation. The school is the milieu where important competencies and affective traits are developed; if the student successfully meets the demands of the school, he begins a healthy adjustment to society. The study was conducted in three schools in a middle-class neighborhood; students from second, fourth, sixth, and eighth grades were selected. Dealing with the three affective variables of  self-esteem, self-concept of ability, and locus of control in the academic setting, the study explores the impact of successful and unsuccessful achievement over time on affective traits, the influence of the home on the relationships between academic achievement and affective traits, and the impact of perceived social roles on that relationship.

Objectives of the counseling part of the program include self-analysis, study skills, self-responsibility, liaison with other college classes, and personal problems. Behavioral objectives in reading fall under categories of rate, comprehension, vocabulary, flexibility, and analysis. Students involved in the program were preponderantly male and often several years older than their classmates; a disproportionate number were veterans. In most cases poor reading skills occurred with a galaxy of personal and attitudinal problems. The major purpose of counseling was to convince each student that he was an interesting, worthwhile person and that he could and  would be helped to improve his ability to do college work. Individual conferences, small group experiences, and sensitivity groups were employed, coupled with a structural \"contract\" method for improved reading ability. (SES)",

The researchers assumed that form of address is problematic for subordinates in social interaction and is a dilemma whose solution represents an evaluation by the addressor of both the addressed and his relationship to the addressed. The study examines certain characteristics of faculty members--age, authority, eminence, visibility, and years at the university--as potential influences on social distance between themselves and graduate students. Data from questionnaires distributed to graduate students indicate that form of address is especially problematic for subordinates  in the academic setting where social structure is fluid and the potential for role strain is great. However, the more advanced graduate students exhibit less formality in addressing faculty and even manifest the ambiguity of their relationships with faculty by avoiding any form of address.

Since the problem is pervasive and the number of trained limited, the author suggests that the group program is an efficient and effective method of attacking test anxiety. The program described here has been used with Georgia State University students who either volunteered or were professionally referred. The number, length, and spacing of meetings is discussed as well as an outline of the content of the sessions. The first session is spent discussing systematic desensitization in simple terms, talking about tests, anxiety, and an orientation to what lies ahead. The next two or three  sessions are devoted to learning deep muscular relaxation, while the last four to six are spent going through the hierarchy. The role of the counselor as a fascilitator of such programs in preventative mental health is also examined. (Author/SES)",

        "description":"This article attempts to demonstrate that an individual's occupational goals become adjusted to the position he is in---blocked goals tend to become of less interest and available goals are of increased interest, which tends to decrease dissonance. The author's hypothesis is that middle class occupational status occupants over a period of time shift their involvement in occupational goals, lowering them in high blockage areas and increasing them in low blockage areas to reduce cognitive dissonance. Salaried male employees (104) in various middle-sized industries in Michigan were selected for the sample. Using 25 possible goals areas in middle class occupations, with a scale measuring the amount of perceived blockage and involvement for each area, the study used age and tenure to  measure the lengths of time the individual had been exposed to the blockage. General conclusions showed were that the negative relationship between the blockage and involvement factors shows a decided increase with an advance in age and tenure. (Author/SES)",

The interpersonal variables examined were selected according to the conceptual and research model for assessment of the helping relationship advanced by Carkhuff. From this model of assessment the following hypothesis was developed; ability to discriminate and communicate the specified interpersonal variables would be significantly different for social workers across differing training, background, and levels of related social work experiences. Results show that social workers with graduate training in social work performed significantly higher on the criterion measure of communication than did the four other groups, including bachelors degrees and first year social  service trainees. No differences were observed across the group on the discrimination measure, nor did differences exist among the groups when compared across levels of experience for either of the two criterion measures. Finally, sex did not appear to be related to performance on the selected measures. (Author)",

The Council concludes that for significant reform to occur, it is imperative to view guidance as an integral part of the total educational process and to consider a comprehensive and systematic approach to change. The problem does not revolve around resources alone, but it is how resources are used that is most important. (Author/SES)",

The Laboratory School of the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls has been involved in such a program since 1968. As the project developed, the potential for very serious problems relating to racial tension and student frustration became evident. To approach these problems and to promote more openness and understanding between students from different communities and differing cultural backgrounds, cross-cultural group counseling sessions were developed. The groups during the past two years have consisted of combined 7th and 8th graders and combined 9th through 12th graders. Due to administrative support,  student requests, and observed behavior change, a similar grouping of students will be employed during the 1972-73 academic year. Counselor observations of the program are examined, and student and faculty questionnaires and analyses of them are also included in this paper. (Author)",

The items on the questionnaire were identical except that the word \"black\" was inserted in one form and the word \"female\" in another. The overall results showed that faculty were generally more positive toward blacks and females than toward undergraduates in general. The faculty stereotype for blacks was one of serious, hardworking, outspoken students who often deserve greater punishment for breaking rules. Females were seen as the best, hardest working, most creative students. Although faculty members may not hold these attitudes, the authors conclude that the direction of their  over-compensation suggests that they may at least be aware of potential prejudices toward blacks and females.

The sample was drawn from all 14 and 15 year olds attending state secondary schools in the State of Victoria, Australia, during 1971. The results indicate that an adolescent's view of his own competence, already developed on the basis of past life experience, does affect the ordering of variables that might explain educational expectations.

Two forms of the instrument, each containing the same situations, bipolar scales and instructions (except that in one form the situation applied to a woman), were administered to 110 males at freshman orientation at the University of Maryland. Although the responses to the forms did not appear immediately to measure sexism, a closer examination reveals that sexism appears to be a stereotype reaction to any change in the sex role, for either sex.

Data from a sample of 318 fifth grade students of lower, middle, and upper socio-economic classes indicate that some of the influence which norm-referenced grades can have on students' psychological development can be beneficial, but these grades can also subject students' self concepts and mental health to unnecessary risk. Employing criterion referenced evaluation procedures and mastery learning strategies may reduce this risk, the author believes. Multiple regression analysis was used to investigate the relationships among (1) predictor variables: grades and achievement test performance;  (2) criterion variables: twelve indices of self concept and five mental health scores; and (3) control variables: IQ, social class, sex, age, level of aspiration, duration of attendance at present school, and other measures of classroom evaluation.

The study objectives were: 1) to operationally define these two classes of counselor response and train two counselors to produce them upon cue in a counseling session, using an operant conditioning paradigm; to measure the discriminating or eliciting value of counselor restatement and interpretation upon the client's production of feeling responses in the interview; and 3) to measure the resistence of client exploration of feeling to extinction after affect has been elicited, using each technique. Two female counselor experimenters were trained to conduct the experimental interviews with 40 female subjects  who volunteered to participate in a 30-minute counseling interview. Results indicate that while restatement has a detrimental effect on client exploring of feeling, interpretation enhances an important goal of counseling, to talk about one's feelings.

Control of both socioeconomic variables and mother's age (by analysis of variance as well as by analysis of covariance) failed to alter the relationships. Step-down analyses suggested that the effects were due to a verbal component and that no differences were attributable to non-verbal factors. Detailed sibship configurations based on birth order, family size, sibling spacing, and sibling sex were developed for both sexes. The resulting 82 different sibship  configurations were ranked by test score means.

A questionnaire containing six likert-type scale items involving attitudes toward personal growth groups was completed by each subject after exposure to the experimental treatment. Results by the study strongly support the basic assumption that attitudinal changes are accomplished most  validly through participation in which individuals are directly involved.

        "description":"This paper is a systematic attempt to apply the principles and techniques of behavior modification to process and outcome in group therapy. The framework is derived from learning theory, and is aimed at providing a conceptual model for the understanding and practice of group therapy in which symptom redress is the primary goal. A number of promising therapeutic strategies and techniques evolved directly from the application of a behavioral methodology to groups. These strategies and techniques are presented in the -- the development of group cohesiveness, assessment, and intervention. Particular emphasis is placed upon the crucial role of thorough and ongoing assessment. Intervention is comprised of five major therapeutic thrusts, as follows: A.) engaging in graded behavioral  tasks both inside and outside the group; B.) training in self-change strategies and techniques; C.) enhancing client motivation and participation in therapy; D.) using group members as therapeutic change agents; and E.) ensuring generalization of newly learned behaviors from the safe confines of the group to the world outside. The advantages and limitations of this approach to group therapy were discussed. (Author)",

Specifically, the study examines the two-part question: 1) to what extent, and 2) in what manner can classroom achievement (grades) be predicted by selected cognitive and affective variables. The findings of the study lend further clarification to the prediction of classroom achievement. As expected, cognitive variables contribute to explaining variation in classroom grades, but the combination of cognitive and affective variables in a six predictor equation explain only 32% of the variation in grades. The authors conclude that moderate relationships between cognitive measures and classroom achievement should be accepted and future  research might include personality characteristics in studies of differences in classroom achievement. Short reviews of the literature to date are included. (Author/SES)",

        "description":"The study examines changes in social interest scores of freshmen in a community college over a period of one semester. The authors hypothesized that students who attended the community college for the full semester, with all of the services offered to them, should show an increase in social interest as they became more aware of their ability to contribute and found increased self-significance within the college environment. It was also hypothesized that there would be a difference in social interest by sex. Results of the study of 228 freshmen showed that although females had higher social interest scores than males, males gained in social interest over the one semester period. These results were attributed to the college environment, initially low Social Interest Interest  scores, and perhaps to the college curriculum and specialized student services. While there was no relationship between social interest and socioeconomic status, there were variable relationships between social interest and academic achievement, class rank, and age.

Sampling a total 898 high school senior boys, this study found that younger minority boys do have lower grades and lower occupational and educational aspirations. However, in contrast to Rosenberg's speculation that they receive more affection from their parents, it was found that younger-minority boys see their mothers, and to a small degree their fathers also, as less loving and more demanding than do other boys. The authors suggest that younger-minority boys may be less achievement oriented because of the particular combination of relationships they have with their parents, in  contrast to Rosenberg's conclusion that the low achievement need by the younger-minority boy is the result by his unconditional acceptance and special affection he receives from his parents and older sisters.

The results indicate that \"social reinforcers\" are effective to the extent that they communicate to the child unambiguous information on the adequacy of his performance. These events are normally of only modest effectiveness in the immediate control of performance as studied in both experimental and classroom settings. Negative statements, on the other hand, have been shown to be highly effective in both contexts. Further analysis suggests that the traditional focus upon social reinforcement processes oversimplifies the nature of the actual interpersonal controls used by the teacher. It  is argued, in conclusion, that it is necessary to go beyond simple concepts of \"social reinforcement\" in order to come to grips with the interpersonal events that are effective in behavior development and behavior control.

Projects combining Title II reading projects with a give-away book program in Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New Jersey are described. Although Title II funds cannot be used to provide books to give away, funds from federal sources, such as ESEA Title I and Model Cities, and from civic groups, foundations, alumni organizations, and business and industry are being utilized to buy books. The idea of giving books to children as a means of motivating them to read is derived from Reading Is FUN-damental (RIF), a national program funded by a private foundation and sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution. The program is based on the  theory that if children are able to choose books from a wide and interesting selection to keep for their very own, they might be put on the road to addictive reading. Reports on Title II reading projects which have been combined with a give-away program show a sharp increase in the use of instructional materials and school media centers. Teachers and media specialists also note improvement in reading tastes as the projects continue. (Author/TO)",

Each of these categories is in turn divided into subcategories, which may be broken down further into second and third order differentiations, the rather specific goals from which the behavioral objectives have been derived. These generic behavioral objectives may then be modified to fit the  local reading needs or, in many cases, may be used to generate several more specific objectives, which become the real behavioral goals of instruction.

The present study assesses the effect of comprehension on the recognition of meaning and wording changes with concrete and abstract sentences. Part of a group of 120 undergraduates at the University of Massachusetts was presented with sentences embedded in a context paragraph designed to increase comprehension. Results indicated that recognition for meaning changes in abstract sentences was significantly higher for the sentence-embedded group than for the group presented the sentences without  the paragraphs. There was no appreciable difference between the groups in recognition of wording changes in abstract sentences or of both meaning and wording changes in concrete sentences. The results are discussed in light of recent models which propose different storage mechanisms for concrete and abstract sentences.

An observer was assigned to each of the four classrooms to record the attentional behaviors of the pupils during the reading hour; 15 visits were made over the course of a month. Positive attentiveness included task relevant behaviors, whereas non-task orienting behavior was scored negatively. Results indicated that girls were significantly more attentive than boys and achieved higher word recognition scores. Word  recognition was found to be significantly related to attentiveness for the group as a whole, with reading readiness controlled in a covariance analysis. It was concluded that overt, task relevant, orienting behavior was related to scholastic achievement and was acquired in beginning reading, before a long history of academic success-failure had been established.

Experimenters were led to expect differential conditioning performance from the subjects prior to the experiment. The subjects, 24 undergraduate students, were informed as to the nature of the experiment and were instructed to provide results which were compatible with the experimenters' expectations. The experimenters' directions to the subjects were audio-taped and rated by trained judges. Analyses of data produced several marginal findings but generally  failed to demonstrate that bias is communicated through systematic variations in the measured language features. It was noted, however, that the response measures analyzed in this study were more specific than measures examined in earlier research and that the failure to uncover anticipated relationships suggests the study direct attention to an anomaly or inconsistency in the chain of logic underlying a substantive phenomenon which can serve to prompt further exploration and clarification.

        "description":"This study compares the effectiveness of two approaches to teaching survival reading skills to 50 semi-literate adults. One group was given reading instruction from high interest-low vocabulary reading materials at appropriate levels of difficulty according to their results on the Gray Oral Reading Test, Form A. The second group was given reading instruction in materials selected because of their frequency of use in daily activities, such as newspapers, magazines, forms for welfare payments, driver's licenses, appliance warranties, and job applications with no attention given to the readability level of any of the materials. Following four months of small group tutoring three times a week, both groups were retested with Form B of the Gray Oral and were administered a  questionnaire to assess their feelings about the program and how much they felt it helped them. The second group made significant gains on the post-test and also had more positive feelings about the program. Findings indicated that increases in performance were more closely related to motivation than to instructional materials. (Author/TO)",

(2) was there anything that your teachers did that detracted from your interest in reading? (3) was there someone or something besides your teacher who contributed to your competence and interest in reading? From their answers several generalized observations about the school reading programs and teachers as these students remember them are made. Teachers' oral reading is frequently mentioned as most enjoyable and stimulating. Creative teaching and teacher enthusiasm are recalled as prime motivators while repetitive drill and dull  reading classes are listed as negative influences. School librarians often served as an inspiration to these students. The major influence for all these students was the parents or family. Most had been read to as children, had parents who read for pleasure, had books and magazines readily available in the home, and were encouraged (but not pressured) to read for enjoyment and information.

Four random orders of the pairs were constructed for each list, those four orders being presented for Trials 1 through 4, repeated for Trials 5 through 8, etc. The lists were presented on a Stowe memory drum. Each pair was presented twice in a row at a 2:2-second rate. Ten subjects received one of the two lists, and ten other subjects received the other list within each condition. The three conditions differed only in their method of choosing the correct item during  anticipation. Some of the results indicated that the mean sum of errors for the groups that pronounced their choice was lower than the mean sum of errors for the groups that pressed a button to indicate their choice or verbalized the position of their choice. Also, the groups that pronounced their choice required fewer trials to criterion. These differences were not statistically reliable. (WR)",

The materials, called programed prose materials, are developed in an objective manner amenable to computer production. Phase I of the project involved an extensive investigation of a new technique, the reading-storage test, for measuring the learning that occurs during reading. The results suggested that the completely objective reading-storage test provides a better measure of the primary effects of reading than its two closest rivals--the cloze test and the paraphrase test. In the Phase II experiment, programed prose was compared to regular prose under low and high motivation conditions.  The programed prose facilitated learning under the low motivation condition and inhibited learning under the high motivation condition. Phases III and IV, to be conducted within the next year, will assess the effectiveness of programed prose of varying levels of material difficulty and will investigate the effectiveness of the method in a situation where it would be expected to be maximal.

Called &quot;Students Helping Students,&quot; the program used 40 seventh and eighth graders as tutors in reading, mathematics, and language for about 80 first through fourth graders. Following a one-week training session, two or four older students were assigned to each participating elementary classroom, one or two each day on alternate days for one hour. Evaluation of the program was conducted in four ways: evaluation by the program staff on a day-to-day basis, teacher assessment of tutee progress, absenteeism count of the tutors, and an attitudinal survey of both the tutors and tutees at the beginning and end of the program, as  well as a feedback survey of the elementary teachers involved. Results showed that almost half of the tutees showed greater academic progress with tutors than without; 60 percent of the tutors improved their attendance records; and there was no significant change in attitude of either tutors or tutees. Anecdotal reports of the student helpers, interview readouts by the tutors, research summaries and evaluation instruments, and the program coordinator's evaluation are included as appendixes. (TO)",

Only those materials written in a language very similar to that which the child hears and uses himself, the author argues, will serve as the best teaching devices. Since the language of literature, more than any other written language, contains the same patterns and behaves much the same as oral language, the teacher should begin reading instruction with stories based on actual experiences children have had and should encourage children to create stories from their own experiences. The author discusses a number of children's books which reflect children's interests and experiences. The author also argues that an  individualized reading program can help to improve reading skills and to facilitate critical thinking ability, and she discusses various stories and poems that may help to accomplish these goals effectively and naturally.

The author suggests that many schools have problems teaching students to enjoy reading because the teachers too often attempt to teach from inferior school texts rather than from books that are worthy of study that is, books which are worth re-reading and which inspire reflective thought, within a course of study that should be enjoyable in itself. The author states that too often school textbooks cheapen and sully the students' learning, that only an education based on the great books provides the substance of a real education. Schoolbook culture, it is contended, offers no valid entry into the real world because it too often excludes the study  of serious works of literary art. A genuine education would not only expose children at an early age to the great books but it would also treat writing as an art rather than as a set of mechanical skills to be mastered. (Author/DI)",

Eight postulates, fundamental to both the General Open Systems Theory and the Substrata-Factor Theory, were identified. It was concluded (1) that there was an isomorphic relationship between all postulates in the two theories; (2) that subject matter areas could be conceived of as suprasystems girded by diverse,  yet fundamentally related, subsystems; (3) that working system hierarchies were found for each content area manifesting quantitative and qualitative differences in organization of substrata sequences, amount of variance called for, and redundancy of particular variables; (4) that reciprocal interaction could be inferred from and X on Y and Y on X regression analysis; and (5) that the proration sequential technique might provide a basis for determining the extent of a particular subsystem's impact on the suprasystem.

In the primary research, subjects were given a list of words followed by an interpolated task. The data of interest were the recall for terminal items in the list. Using this procedure, the researchers have demonstrated negative recency in initial recall and have provided evidence that this effect is attributable to store-specific interference in primary memory. They have also demonstrated that this effect is a necessary consequence of the procedure rather than the result of a strategy on the part of the subject. In the secondary memory research, interest was focused on procedures in which subjects learned categorized lists. It was demonstrated that subjects learned how to cluster over  successive lists and that this effect probably resulted from an increase in the post-item latency used as a criterion to exit a category and search another during recall. It has also been demonstrated that ability to recall is correlated with amount of clustering. Another set of results came from experiments demonstrating that repeated-category interference can be eliminated through the use of subcategorization or adjectival modification. (WR)",

Variables concerned with short-term memory, presentation rate, study time, distribution of practice, transfer of conceptual schemes, and instruction regarding potential sources of organization in the materials to be learned were investigated. Learning ability was found to be unrelated to short-term memory, although fast learners had a higher probability of recalling a word on the trial immediately following the trial on which it was first recalled, and they recalled more of the words in  the pool to be learned than did slow learners; these findings were suggested to be reflections of individual differences in encoding processes. The use of the same or a somewhat different conceptual scheme in the learning of two successive lists appeared to have differential transfer effects for fast and slow learners. Also, pointing out potentially useful bases of organization in the material to be learned seemed to have differential transfer effects for fast and slow learners. (Author/WR)",

Additionally, it underlines the scope and variety of  the projects. This &quot;checklist&quot; is not meant to be definitive, but rather a reflection of the scope of those projects which were reported to the Secretariat in some detail. The U.S. IBY efforts, combined with world-wide response to the year, are having important consequences for all members of the book community and the general public. The success of IBY is compelling proof of what happens when all members of the book community work together to accomplish common objectives. (Author/NH)",

Four hundred and fifty students--representative of the school population according to grade level, race, sex, and scholastic standing--were given a questionnaire reflecting their reading interests and habits. Responses were weighted to determine preference more exactly. Data from the questionnaire were put on punched cards and fed into an IBM 7094 computer. Some overall conclusions are: Mystery-detective stories seem to be favorites at all levels; Boys and girls differ generally in their first choice of reading interests; White and Black students agree on mystery-detective stories as first choices and generally agree in the next four or five areas  of interest; Above-average and average students agree on mystery-detective stories as their first choice, while below-average students favor sports stories; The primary factors influencing students to read are magazines and television movies and programs; Stories of a contemporary nature are favorites among all groups; In general, junior high students read what is currently of interest, with a base of some classical authors.

At least two broad categories of costs are associated with information retrieval from a data base such as ERIC: fixed costs or overhead and data base associated costs. The concern at Auburn reflected in this paper, has been particularly with three data base associated costs: preparation of records before searching, selection of a software search system, and implementation of search strategy. Computational algorithms associated with costing particular jobs should have terms applicable to each of these variables. The first two are rather straightforward to implement, but the third, because it is a human variable, is  difficult to access. The most powerful approaches to cost reduction seem to be associated with partitioning of the data base into components specific to the needs of the user population. (Author/SJ)",

The separation of the three planes of work classification -- idea, notational, and verbal -- and its conscious application is indicated. Mention is made of the advantage of recognising modes of formation of new subjects and isolates. The concept of compound isolate created by the Law of Parsimony is described. The atomisation of subjects in the Universe of Subjects make it obligatory for library classification to be  based on a sound dynamic theory of classification in each of the three planes. For documentation search, the replacement of the general purpose computer by a special purpose electronic doc-finder is commended. To make the investment on electronic machinery pay back more than itself and to secure noise-free, leakage-free result of search, a continuous improvement in the theory and in the design of a scheme for classification is an absolute necessity.

The test of the system, which involved the use of an on-line computer terminal, is documented. Investigators were concerned with the nature of the material in the data base, particularly the extent of the inclusion of Canadian documents; what types of educators the data base could best serve; exploring the possibilities of cooperative efforts with neighboring institutions and agencies that shared certain needs; comparing the value of a machine-based retrieval system with a manual operation; and arriving at some notion of costs involved in adopting the new  service. Findings in these areas are reported. Materials developed to acquaint users with the system and questionnaires designed to tap user reaction are appended. (Author/KE)",

        "description":"A user contacts a reference librarian when he needs assistance to solve a methodological problem in getting information from the scholarly record. The reference librarian then takes on the user's problem. There are two responses the reference librarian can make: (1) teach the user how to access the scholarly record for his immediate purpose, or (2) provide the user with an &quot;answer&quot; to his problem. The latter only becomes justifiable if the reference librarian can respond in the user's problem-solving time frame. From this perspective then the reference librarian always has the obligation to explain the organization of the library and/or the organization of the literature. An &quot;answer&quot; is only provided if it is cost beneficial as judged from the user's time for both the user and  the reference librarian. Thus in programming reference service the number of correct (or incorrect) answers is unimportant because the reference service has the obligation to reveal an organization, not an answer. Again from this perspective it is possible to plan reference service on a consistent basis throughout a library system; that is, it is not the complexity of the organization of the literature on which a reference service is based, but on the methodology for using the organization. The user has a defined responsibility to learn for himself if the librarian cannot respond within the user's problem-solving time frame. A protocol is suggested for estimating work loads utilizing the above perspective of reference service. (Author/NH)",

The reference retrieval system is based on the atomic and molecular physics section of the INSPEC tapes. The tapes contain complete abstracts of the documents which are incorporated into the system, and from these a thesaurus of relevant keywords is constructed. The data base is searched using these keywords. There are over 7000 documents indexed and the thesaurus contains about 3000 terms. The numerical data system allows a user to retrieve and manipulate with numerical data. At present, the data base consists of atom-atom potentials which are extracted from the literature. For  each state is stored the available potential data along with a reference to the source, an estimate of the accuracy and the range of validity. The potentials can take various forms, for example, a table of values or the parameters of a formula of known form. At present six forms of potential curve fits can be accommodated. The fits are stored in atomic units but can be outputted in the units chosen by the user. The system allows the user to manipulate with the stored data. (Author/SJ)",

These were studied in relation to library attitude, usage, skill and knowledge. The card catalog, vertical file, periodicals, and reference books were evaluated to obtain statistics for the conclusions of this study. Using the chi-square test for significance, it was found that girls were more academic than boys, and students who had taken library science classes were more studious. Higher reading ability students showed a greater interest in hardbound books and boys generally preferred paperbound books. The students knew that the card catalog was useful, but did not know how to use it. Dictionary skill was found to be a problem.  Periodicals were chosen according to student interest and significantly, the \"Reader's Guide\" was the least used reference tool in all three school districts' libraries. Browsing and requesting librarian assistance were the two main finding tools used by the students. Skill in using reference books was definitely increased by taking a formal library science class.

The case is made by a growing cult of librarians who are engaged in \"teaching the library\" that the librarian so engaged makes a direct contribution to the student's success at his studies. Although there is general agreement that students need help in the use of the library, real disagreement does exist as to (1) exactly who needs that help, (2) under what conditions, (3) when, and (4) to what degree. This proposal confronts that disagreement, suggesting that library instruction should be given to the student at the time of need, to all classes (status) of students, continuously (but not repetitiously) and at a cost so cheap that the  recipient cannot afford to pass it up. Six guiding principles, expanding on the aforementioned suggestions, are offered along with a four-level sample program of instruction. Program evaluation, resource base, faculty involvement and other problems inherent in the program are discussed. (Author/KE)",

The first of two sessions began in the spring, 1972, with 19 mothers participating. A tutor visited each mother for one hour each week to discuss specific aspects of child development and to provide her with specific related activities to work on with her child. The mother was asked to spend at least 15 minutes a day working with the child on the activities. One of the main objectives of the program was to give the mothers practical information with which to better understand both her child and her child's development. Most important, the activities were to serve as a bridge for  mother-child interaction. The program initially consisted of 16 lessons. The Survey of Parent Attitudes was administered to each mother in an interview upon the completion of lesson 7. Each mother filled out a weekly progress sheet reporting the child's progress with the activities. After a break, the second session began with 15 of the same mothers. The program was considered successful: (1) there was a large increase in the amount of mother-child interaction; (2) mothers were a little more understanding of child behavior; and (3) children improved physically, mentally, emotionally, and socially.

        "description":"Two studies were done to examine aggressive behavior in humans. In Experiment One, adults working on a plunger pulling task could receive a 3.5 ma shock at 75% probability every two minutes. The shock was unrelated to their plunger pulling behavior. Subjects could press a toggle switch to deliver electric shock to the experimenter, who was in the room with the subjects as an alleged observer. Three sessions in which no shock was delivered alternated with two sessions in which shock was delivered. In shock sessions subjects pressed the toggle switch and shocked the observer at an average rate more than nine times higher than in the non-shock sessions. In Experiment Two, baselines of aggressive behavior were collected for three consecutive 120- or 90-minute segments daily. The  subjects were two children, and a single-subject repeated measures multiple baseline design was used. After approximately two weeks of baseline, a brief time-out was made contingent upon aggressive behavior which occurred in the first segment each day, and non-contingent time-outs roughly yoked to the time-outs in the first segment were delivered in the third segment each day. Other conditions were also included. Non-contingent time-out seemed to control an above baseline rate of aggressive behavior in the segments in which it was programmed, and in adjacent segments. Results were interpreted as replicating the animal laboratory findings relating non-contingent aversive stimulation to aggressive behavior. (Author/KM)",

Different definitions and different tests have been proposed for these two abilities. Several studies indicate that women generally perform more poorly on spatial tests than do men; it has been suggested that this sex difference has an hereditary basis. Several studies support this hypothesis. A study has shown that females with Turner's Syndrome perform much more poorly on Wechsler performance subtests than on the verbal subtests, but immaturity due to parental indulgence may account for these results. A research question of considerable interest is at how early an age spatial ability can be tested. Few  attempts have been made to improve performance on spatial tests by practice or relevant training, but the author has such a study with third and fifth graders underway. Such studies have shown training to improve scores considerably. References are provided. (KM)",

The purpose of the project is to assess the effectiveness of systematic intervention by public school teachers, starting at the period of infancy, in preventing the intellectual deficits commonly found in children from disadvantaged populations. To control some of the important variables, four groups have been established: an experimental group, a contrast group, and two control groups. The experimental group utilizes home teaching by public school teachers; the contrast groups employs home visits by volunteer college  students and young women from the community to provide adult attention for the child and service to the family; one control group is a no-treatment group receiving only the same testing as other groups; and the other control group is a no-treatment, no-testing group. Testing instruments used are: Maternal Behavior Inventory; Teacher's Report, Form B; Infant Cognitive Home Environment Scale; Infant Information Inventory; Infant and Maternal Medical History; Ypsilanti Picture Sorting Inventory; Bayley Infant Scales of Development; and Kagan Measures. The pilot study conducted during the first 6 months of the project focused upon organization of the home teaching program, the data collection procedures, and staff orientation. (DB)",

        "description":"The Perceptual Analysis Kindergarten Test is based on the rationale or thesis that learning is hierarchical. The test is used to help determine the level of the child in the hierarchy so that a remedial program can be devised to bring the child up to the level where he can develop the associative conceptualization required to be able to learn in the academic setting. The test can be given to a group of children by a teacher, preferably in two sessions; if given individually, the test may be done in one session. It is not a time test. In some cases, it might take about half an hour totally and individually, it can be done within 15 or 20 minutes. The first part of the test attempts to determine what perception the child has of himself. In the second part, the test determines  whether the visual perception of the child is sufficiently integrated so that he is able to see similarities and differences in pictures of people, designs of a geometric nature, letters, and words. The third part tests auditory-visual modality of learning. The fourth part determines the child's eye-hand coordination and ability to reproduce designs. The fifth part also deals with eye-hand coordination, but combines this with directional ability and ability to follow through with increasingly complex designs. The sixth part is a combination vocabulary and gross auditory discrimination test. The seventh part determines whether the child understands directions. The eighth part tests a basic arithmetic concept, and the ninth part measures visual memory kinesthetic mode of learning.  (DB)",

The Cornerstone School and the method associated with it provide treatment for children ages three to six years within a nursery classroom group setting. A therapist works six or more hours per week in the classroom, during which time he is working with all the children in the group--five to seven children. Two early childhood educators are in charge of the classroom educational activities, which proceed throughout the sessions. Teachers meet with the therapist almost daily to share observations and communications from parents, as well as to hear the material gathered during treatment that may not have been overheard in the class session. Parents are  interviewed by the head teacher each week, and the therapist meets individually with parents once a month. A majority of the children have existing emotional disturbances, but patients who come for preventive reasons are accepted and given priority. In the classroom setting, there is considerable rapid emotional growth, tendency to progress from infantile and pathological patterns of psychological function, and spontaneous expressivity. Examples are given of moments in the Cornerstone classroom, which show the method in use with a variety of children. Following this, details of the treatment of a single child are given. A set of criteria used for codifying aspects of the treatment process are appended. (DB)",

Particular emphasis is given to the way the child uses informational resources to attain an educational goal, i.e., the question of how children seek and use available information. The data gathering procedures ranged from the development and use of fairly precise testing devices to informal observations of children's reactions. The research strategy was to move back and forth from studies of the learning center in a controlled laboratory context to those in an open classroom environment. Three types of questions were raised in studying this interface between the child and the instructional environment: (1) children's strategies of information-seeking and use, (2) effectiveness of  the learning center in terms of immediate learning outcomes, and (3) possible long-range outcomes. The major unit used for the studies was a learning center which posed a paired-associate learning task. Studies with Head Start children in the laboratory and using the laboratory in a classroom setting are described. Wide individual differences were found in the way young children engaged in self-prompting. Although there was no definite evidence obtained, it seems plausible that the way children attack this task of self-instruction reflects broader personality patterns. The learning center was of considerable interest for most of the young children, being in use from 75% to 100% of the time; it was also effective as a means for self-instruction for a large proportion of these children.

The educational psychotherapy process attempts to operate at the interface between education and psychotherapy. The components of catharsis, recall, sharpening and correcting of perceptions, correction of projections, and emphatic insistence upon adaptation to everyday reality are all parts of the work of educational psychotherapy. The method is particularly appropriate for the young age group. The training of teachers is carried out in a formal two-year training program in which each trainee spends a minimum of 12 hours per week. At least six of the hours are spent working with children and their families, and six are  didactic and supervisory. Each trainee must have treated at least three children, of various diagnostic categories, and their parents over the two-year period, and must have participated in the evaluation process with observations and brief trial therapies. Trainees are required to have, or are encouraged to work toward while in training, New York State Certification in Early Childhood or its equivalent. On completion of training, the educational psychotherapist can go into schools and day care centers, can become a mental health resource person, or can become a mental health professional. Two clinical examples are given of the educational psychotherapy process. (DB)",

The classroom observation form and observer rating scale were keyed to what the sponsors said distinguished their model. Consultants developed sponsor-specific checklists. Controversy over expected outcomes and selection of tests of cognitive development created additional problems. It was found that statistical analysis could not compensate for the research design. Year 1 saw an emphasis on assessing  implementation, the creation of the Classroom Observation instrument, the investment in creating new measures for years 2 and 3, the clinical case history and the consultant as innovations. Year 2 added a review panel for the project and increased the investment in developing new child and family measures. Year 3 added sponsor-specific studies, research for individual sponsors.

In relation to (1) above, data collected at all E&amp;R centers in 1967-68, using the Social Interaction Observation form, showed that children increase in socialization, and are more likely to increase in interactions with the same group during preschool programs. In relation to (2) above, a few of Sowder's more than 18 recommendations  for further research on socialization are summarized. Sowder recommends research which: re-examines the issue of whether or not prejudice is entirely learned; through longitudinal studies traces the development of children's attitudes toward themselves and others and the relationship between developmental processes and environmental influences thought to be related to formation of ethnic and social class behavior; clarifies when conformity behavior is and is not damaging to the child's development and to achievement of harmonious group relations; and investigates of competition on child development, and the role which competition may play in hindering successful ethnic and social class mix in child care institutions. In relation to (3) above, socialization is predicted to be a key  variable for &quot;success&quot; in the year 2000. (DB)",

A third type of classroom is the Piagetian School, which is baed on Piaget's developmental theories. The major principles of Piaget are relevant for the development of a broad, comprehensive approach to early childhood education. The final classroom is the Free School and the Open School, which is characterized by  almost unlimited freedom.

Home-centered educational programs are offered as an alternative to the early learning center. The home may offer the child the support the child needs or it may offer neglect and abuse. Variety is essential in learning centers. Intellectual development of the child is closely linked to the controlled introduction of novelty into the child's physical learning centers. The adult is responsible for studying the child and for matching materials for  learning with his emerging needs.

The families of the children were matched to control families on a number of variables. Analysis of the study data provided the following findings: (1) center children scored significantly higher on the Stanford-Binet Intelligence test than did controls from a low-education group, but not as high as controls from a high-education group; there were few differences among the three groups on the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities; (2) on the Schaefer Classroom Behavior Inventory, the center children had greater than  median responses on all the items reflecting social and emotional developmental maturity, and had responses below the median on social and emotional items reflecting developmental immaturity; on the Beller Scale, results showed that the center children had developed very superior attention and persistence habits, satisfaction and interest in work, and the ability to carry out tasks autonomously and with initiative; the Schaefer Classroom Checklist was found a powerful predictor of 36-month IQ; (3) on the Self-Esteem and Emmerich's Observer Ratings of Children, the center children rated high on the self-esteem rating scale, and the group mean on the entire scale was relatively high; results from the Emmerich showed that the program children appeared to be more involved, expressive,  relaxed, active, energetic, stable, social, assertive, independent, constructive, purposeful, affectionate, socially secure, flexible, and happy than controls; and (4) nutrition in center and control families was good.

Home start is a 3-year Head Start demonstration program, aimed at the 3-5 years of age range, which focuses on enhancing the quality of children's lives by building upon existing family strengths and emphasizing the role of parents in the growth and development of their children. The program relies upon home visits made by trained home visitors. Home Start is concerned with the child's nutrition, health, mental health, and education. All of the Home Start programs initiate or strengthen productive relationships with existing community services and resources. The program evaluation incorporates three components:  the formative evaluation, the summative evaluation, and the information system. The 16 projects described are those in Gloucester, Mass., Binghamton, N.Y., Parkersburg, W. Va., Franklin, N.C., Harrogate, Tenn., Huntsville, Ala., Cleveland, Ohio, Houston, Tex., Dardanelle, Ark., Wichita, Kan., Millville, Utah, Reno, Nev., San Diego, Calif., Fairbanks, Alaska, Fort Defiance, Ariz., Weslaco, Tex.

Ss were 12 girls and 12 boys, aged 3-5 years, from a traditional culture, Orthodox Judaism, and 12 girls and 12 boys (same age range) from a nontraditional culture. The parents of the latter group shared the idea that stereotyping of female and male roles harms both sexes. The children were presented individually with pictures  of 24 toys, and each child was asked to select her/his eight favorite toys. Next, photos of girls and boys in play situations were shown to the children and stories were read to go with the pictures. Ss were asked to select one child pictured to complete the story. Finally, each subject was asked what he/she thought the differences are between boys and girls. Observational data indicated that the children from the traditional culture played in a very sex-typed manner; at the nontraditional schools, there were no boys' or girls' sides and boys and girls played together. The toy preferences of the traditional boys and girls were significantly different from each other. Non-traditional children were more likely to give non-stereotyped answers to the incomplete story questions. Traditional  childred were more likely to differentiate between the sexes, a tendency also related to age. (KM)",

More extensive cognitive processes are therefore attributed to internal individuals, which, in turn, is used to explain their greater independence from  social demands. (Author)",

From each of these classrooms, six students were randomly selected to be administered the Visual Sequencing Task, the Pictorial Self-Concept Scale, the Ladder (a self-concept measure), and the Pupil Attitude Survey. These pupils were also video taped for observation of their activities in the classroom. All of the pupils in the 37 classrooms were administered the Boehm Test of Basic Concepts. In addition, the parents of the pupils in the 37 classrooms were sent an opinionnaire concerning the Follow Through program. A teacher opinionnaire was distributed to professional staff members who had received Follow Through training. Parental responses revealed a very high level of support for the school program. The teachers  were generally positive toward the program. The videotapes showed that children's activities were generally similar in both higher and lower implementation classes; the students spent the majority of their time by themselves rather than interacting with peer or a teacher. On the Boehm test, children in both types of classes performed equally well, which was also true on the Visual Sequencing Task. On the Ladder, children in both groups generally rated themselves positively on all eight personality dimensions considered. There were no significant differences between the groups on overall self-concept as measured by the Pictorial Self-Concept Scale. The Pupil Attitude Survey results suggest that students in higher implementation classrooms enjoy more creative activities, language arts, and  play activities. (Author/DB)",

A sample of 1,000 households was selected and stratified among the 10 counties and between the open-country rural area and the rural place in proportion to the number of rural households. Data were collected on the characteristics of economically deprived households and on the socioeconomic conditions of the sample, including physical characteristics, skills, unemployment, adult training, and job mobility. Major findings were that: the area was experiencing a rapid rate of non-farm growth; outmigration has been extensive; housing was inadequate;  scholastic achievement was directly related to the education of the parent; the dropout rate was high; heads of households had little formal education but were willing to change jobs; and most of the working-age population expressed interest in upgrading their skills.

State funds, determined for each district by the &quot;foundation program&quot; formula, supplement this tax. Local school boards, state legislatures, state constitutions, and the voters have the power to provide quality education. In many states, however, the power which might result from increased educational expenditures has been limited. This is especially true for the poor Mexican American population. In Serrano vs Priest, the plaintiffs contend that the dependence on local property taxes for education results in wide revenue disparities among school districts. Rodriguez vs San Antonio Independent School District argues that the state minimum foundation program and general fund  contribution do not equalize the great disparity in taxable property among school districts. In these cases the courts did not reject the property tax but did reject the reliance on it for local funding. The direct effects of these cases on Mexican American education are that they have: (1) served notice that Chicanos will not continue to tolerate discriminatory laws or practices, (2) aroused interest among Chicano law students, and (3) focused on the serious need for increased resources for quality education for everyone.

White high school and elementary strata were found to differ on the basis of organizational and associational participation while the 2 Negro strata differed on both family decision-making and  parental aspirations for children. It was further indicated that cultural pluralism or a difference in cultural traits does not exist when interracial stratum is held constant, although a small amount of social pluralism or institutional skin color distinction does.

        "description":"During 1938-39 a study of students and graduates of the Pine Ridge Federal School revealed that most of these students (98%) stayed on the Oglala Sioux reservation. The school program was largely academic, contributing little to their employability. As a result, the program was remodeled to make it responsive to reservation economic and social needs. In 1950 an intensive evaluation of the school curriculum from 1936 to 1950 was made. Students who were exposed to the remodeled curriculum asked 2 basic questions: (1) Are the former students making a better living through the use of reservations resources or through wage employment as a result of their school training, than would otherwise have occurred? (2) What do these former students think about the effectiveness of the school  program, and how would they change it? The survey was concerned primarily with the usefulness of those parts of the school curriculum which were planned specifically to help American Indians make a better living. Respondents were all adults who had been out of school from 3-10 years. One response stated &quot;This (study) is a chance for an Indian to really speak his mind about the schools.&quot; (FF)",

Stratification was made on the basis of ethnic group, sex, college class, and college enrolled in. Major findings were that Mexican American college students do have significantly lower grade point averages than Anglo students enrolled in the same university; when the entire sample was considered, no significant differences were found when the type of high school attended was  considered; and a comparison of grade point averages in the 5 colleges showed no significant differences between the groups.

Fatalism, a legacy of poverty, dropouts caused by language and culture conflicts, low achievement on English-based IQ tests, and acculturation demands that negate native cultures were cited as factors that deter the progress of bilingual education. Bilingual education often merely taught children to \"parrot\" English, instead of supporting bilingual-bicultural opportunities. One program that has incorporated 2 languages and 2 separate cultural systems is the Bilingual/Bicultural Follow-Through Model for Grades K-12 at the University of  California, Riverside. This program included parent involvement, Spanish as a second language for teachers, community participation, home teaching and heritage curriculum development, and culture-matching teaching strategies.

Also, courses depicting Mexican heritage and culture would develop a stronger self-identification for the Mexican American student and a better understanding for the Anglo.

The third report is a study of southern teacher preparation for professional teaching in the North. Three conclusions appear most significant for the present stage of northern education: (1) while official directives concerning northern education seem to be promising, very often they lack comprehension from the administrators, the teaching staffs, and concerned  populations; (2) local committees must have well-defined responsibilities in the selection, hiring, transfer, and dismissal of teachers; and (3) efforts to post native teachers to the elementary grades should not exclude new and imaginative formulas that depart from the sempiternal tendency to accommodate northern elementary teacher training to the already existing standards and procedures of the South.

The Concentrated Employment Program, as an example of  government help for the Mexican American community, received an affirmative response from 96% of the interviewees. Approximately 76% of the interviewees gave affirmative responses to the question of citizen participation as an effective means for injecting values and goals of the community into the planning process.

The policies of self-determination and a preference for schooling Navajo youngsters as close to home as possible brought about the phase out decision. This in turn questioned the need for the off-reservation schools. It was this to which the Task Force addressed itself. Three areas of exploration for possible uses of the school facility were: (1) the need for a secondary school for American Indian children from other tribes; (2) the need of the facility for other education, i.e., a post-secondary technical  vocational school; and (3) the possible utilization of the facility for non-BIA purposes. The findings indicated that: (1) a secondary school serving various tribal groups does not seem desirable; (2) post-secondary education can be more easily obtained elsewhere; and (3) the possibilities for utilizing the facilities for other non-Bureau purposes were many but all conjectural at the present time.

        "description":"In 1963, the National Child Labor Committee established the National Committee on the Education of Migrant Children (NCEMC) to give new impetus to its work with these children. The over 300,000 migrant children suffered from educational deprivation in the home, inadequate health care, poor housing, and a lack of desirable learning situations. Further deprived by language barriers and rigid grade placement, these children benefited little from programs that concentrated on remedial work without diagnosis of problems. The NCEMC recommended a national plan for migrant child education. This plan should include: (1) revisions of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, Title I, Migrant Amendment, that would cover identification of migrant children, fund allocation, adequate  research and evaluation, and program coordination; (2) emphasis on innovative teaching methods and a national health program; (3) reorganization of migrant school programs; (4) a national teacher recruitment program; and (5) immediate implementation of the recommendations of the Report of the President's Commission on Rural Poverty. The report also included recommendations for the improvement of the lives of migrant workers in general. (KM)",

Examplar facilities of more than 140 observed schools are analyzed in connection with the social influences on science education and the evolving patterns in technology, instructional programs, and student-staff relations. Detailed descriptions are made in terms of instructional space, construction requirements, and management of instructional materials. The trend toward flexibility is emphasized in dealing with aspects of acoustics, internal walls, visual considerations, room furnishings, student groupings, utilities, and safety. Individual learner's needs are described as a major criterion, and  consultations with architects are taken into account. The findings are summarized into: 1) Location of science facilities, 2) Alternative arrangement of facilities, 3) Laboratory furnishings, 4) Supply logistics, 5) Technological support, 6) Human environment, and 7) Community resource utilization. Besides illustrations, an annotated bibliography, a nomination form, and tables of environmental criteria are included in the appendices.

A plan was prepared for the implementation: (1) inservice teachers were given training in the use of ESS kits and motivated to use these effectively, and (2) an Instructional Materials Processing Center was established which employed community people on a part-time basis to construct and replenish old ESS kits for use in classrooms. Costs of ESS kits were reduced in most cases, and employment opportunities were provided for the community and students. The number of teachers using the ESS materials in classrooms has increased considerably. The actual use of these materials in classrooms can be measured by the  fact that these kits were provided to only those teachers who had shown any interest in the materials and training workshops.

Overall, UNESCO has conducted many activities in the environmental field, but most of them have been concentrated in the science sector. Thus, it was concluded, a major effort should be made in the direction of interdisciplinary action with the cooperation of other sectors--physical, biological, social, educational, and cultural.
